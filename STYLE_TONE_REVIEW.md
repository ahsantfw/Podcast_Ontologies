## Potential Additions to Consider

### Additional STYLE Options?

#### 1. **Storytelling** Style
- **Use Case**: Content creators writing scripts, articles, narratives
- **Characteristics**: Narrative flow, scene-setting, character-driven
- **Example**: "Imagine Phil Jackson in the locker room, explaining..."
- **Question**: Is this different enough from "Detailed" + "Enthusiastic"?
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Maybe - depends on content creation use case

#### 2. **Analytical** Style
- **Use Case**: Data-driven research, structured analysis
- **Characteristics**: Data-focused, structured breakdowns, comparisons
- **Example**: "Analysis shows three key patterns: 1) X, 2) Y, 3) Z..."
- **Question**: Is this different from "Academic" + "Neutral"?
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Maybe - could be useful for researchers

#### 3. **Conversational** Style
- **Use Case**: Interview-style, dialogue
- **Characteristics**: Q&A format, dialogue markers
- **Question**: Is this different from "Casual"?
- **Verdict**: ❌ Probably redundant with Casual

### Additional TONE Options?

#### 1. **Supportive** Tone
- **Use Case**: Therapeutic contexts, personal growth
- **Characteristics**: More therapeutic than warm, validation-focused
- **Question**: Is this different from "Warm"?
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Maybe - subtle difference, might be useful

#### 2. **Curious** Tone
- **Use Case**: Exploration, discovery mindset
- **Characteristics**: Question-posing, exploratory language
- **Question**: Is this different from "Enthusiastic"?
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Maybe - could encourage exploration

#### 3. **Inspirational** Tone
- **Use Case**: Motivation, personal development
- **Characteristics**: Uplifting, motivational, aspirational
- **Question**: Is this different from "Enthusiastic"?
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Maybe - more focused on motivation

- Therapeutic support is a PRIMARY use case → Add "Supportive"

**Reasoning:**
