[00:00:26.100] - Speaker 1
It's 2015. I'm sitting on the back of a refrigerated box truck at Coachella. I have food trucks and booths everywhere. I have 30 employees, RVs. It's a massive undertaking to serve food at Coachella. I'm breastfeeding my one-year-old at the back of a refrigerated box truck with the door slightly open, so the cold air is coming up my back and cooling me off while I breastfeed my child out of the hubbub for a moment. And my phone just starts going crazy. And it was, Cafe Gratitude owners are murderers. They have a slaughterhouse. They have this. And then people are tagging me. And then people are saying, Well, I don't know if you know, but Molly is their daughter, the owner of Sage. Her husband is not vegan, and she's not an ethical vegan because she allows... I've seen on Facebook that she made eggs for her husband. I mean, it just was crazy and tagging and tagging. And Cafe Gratitude, never go to Sage, never go to Cafe Gratitude. And it was somehow I got into it. And what had happened was... So my stepmother got Instagram in 2014 and basically viewed it as a way for her children and her many grandchildren, my stepmama has 15 grandchildren, I don't know how much she had at the time, to see what's going on on the farm.

[00:01:51.820] - Speaker 1
So she posted, grandpa's eating his first hamburger in 40 years. This was a year earlier. And because she I don't know, 50 followers that were all in the family, nobody saw it. And it was not a big deal. And we were like, oh, grandpa ate a hamburger. And I actually had assumed when then she did that because I was younger and more savvy about social media, I had assumed that her account was private, but I didn't think to ask. But for some reason, somebody dug up this Instagram post of grandpa eating a hamburger. And it said, we harvested our first cow, blah, blah, blah, blah, and told the story that the cow was sick, and then they were going to put it down. They took the cow to UC Davis, and the vet was like, We have to put her down, but cows do have two uses. We have not medicated her at all. Would you like to bring her back to the farm and have her harvested? I know this guy that can do that at the farm. They decided at the time, yes. Their original thought was, We'll give it to the farm workers and the community, since they loved this cow and they saved her hide.

[00:03:01.420] - Speaker 1
They made her hide into a rug for their bedroom. My dad loves his cows, loves his cows. And so once the meat was in the freezer, he had this thought, I don't eat meat because I don't want to contribute to factory farming. I don't want to contribute to abuse. I love this cow. I snuggled this cow. I put lavender essential oils on this cow to keep the flies off her. I feel like this cow would want me to eat her. I feel like she would want her life essence to go into my life essence. We had a bond. We loved each other. And so he decided to eat this cow. And it went totally viral. And all of a sudden, There's reporters posted outside of the gate of the farm. The Huffington Post is writing about it. It's everywhere. People are just completely crazy. And it impacted both of our businesses significantly. I lost 10% in top-line sales for almost 18 months after this, and I think that they lost more. I had people reaching out to me, influencers, saying, Would you like me to help you distance yourself from your father? I was like, No, I actually think that what he did is right.

[00:04:16.080] - Speaker 1
I don't want to be distanced from my father. And so we eventually survived it. I was still pretty vegan in my mindset at that time, but I understood that regenerative agriculture, I got introduced to that idea in 2013. So I was a couple of years in and had been mulling over how could I become more regenerative with my restaurants? What was that pathway? So we were all watching this. And when I say, Oh, I need my father's partners and my team to see what was going to happen because I wanted to get a farm. I wanted to bring all the food waste from my restaurants and turn it into soil. So we were all watching and observing, and they were protesting. They sped my brother's face. They did all the stuff, but we survived it in the end.

[00:05:10.240] - Speaker 2
What's bizarre about it is you provide the service for the community. You have a vegan restaurant It's popular. It's serving the vegan audience. Your dad chooses to eat a burger. That doesn't impact what the restaurant does, doesn't impact the business model, it doesn't impact the service they're providing to the community. And your father's personal choice is enough for the people who eat at the restaurant to turn on the restaurant.

[00:05:43.100] - Speaker 1
Yes. And that is indicative of a world that we live in where you have to agree with everything someone does, or you have to disagree with everything someone does. And I talk about this a lot, how we have to love people we don't agree with, and we have to agree with people we don't love. This became so apparent during COVID, where all of a sudden someone would be totally canceled. Everything they provided the world was all of a sudden erased because they didn't want to get an experimental technology injected into them. And so vegans, I always say, were at the forefront of cancel culture. They loved to cancel somebody. Someone couldn't get pregnant. They add fish to their diet, they're a traitor. And so I always I had honey in my restaurants because I understood that bees are so important and beekeepers are so important. And if we don't support beekeepers, then there is going to be no vegan diet. I would get people screaming at me in the restaurant, screaming at the top of their their lungs, and I would politely ask them, Could you tell me what you're doing for solutions for pollination?

[00:06:51.040] - Speaker 1
Are you keeping bees and letting them keep all of their honey? What is your solution? I am open to donate money to your solution. As of right now, beekeepers are the custodians of the most important part of the ecosystem that makes almost all of the vegan diet exist. So for you to scream at me and say, You're not going to eat here because I offer honey in my tea or in a beer flavor, I want you to realize this is not grounded in any actually helping the vegans or the planet or anything. It's grounded in an ideology that has no logic. People would at me. I was very aware of how the vegan culture responded. I was prepared when I made the transition of my restaurants from vegan to regenerative, which did not go well.

[00:07:47.820] - Speaker 2
Tell me about when you personally were reborn as a regenerative farmer coming from being a vegetarian or a vegan.

[00:07:57.080] - Speaker 1
I lived in Gernada Hills, and I had this a little more than a quarter of an acre, somewhere between a half acre and a quarter acre in this golf course community. I had all these gardens, and the Wholemothers Association was always fighting me for having a fruit tree in your front yard that wasn't approved or whatever. I loved gardening. I loved growing food. I got some chickens at that time because... I never ate eggs because I didn't eat eggs when I was growing up, so I was not part of my diet. But the chicken poop was so good for my garden. And so many people in the community eat eggs, so I had chickens. My brother went to a climate summit in, I want to say New Zealand, it might have been Australia, but I think it was New Zealand. There was a panel of scientists on the stage, and he was listening. He came out there as a cafe Gratitude. They brought leaders from different businesses that they thought were climate friendly businesses. He's sitting in the and there's three or four scientists on the stage, and all of them but one say, We're doomed.

[00:09:04.800] - Speaker 1
There's no possibility for a future for humanity on the planet. And there's this guy, Gramsate. And Gramsate paints this picture about carbon and how it's the building blocks of all of life, and it's constantly cycling, and we're the Keystone species, and how we have the ability to cycle carbon. And it was presented in such a way that it just sparked a fire in my brother. And he comes home just completely over the moon, excited about this concept, regenerative agriculture. This is in 2013. He sends me Graham Saint's Ted Talk, and I get completely inspired and realized that I've been doing all the things I think I should be doing, driving a hybrid and have a vegan restaurant and growing my own food in my yard, blah, blah, blah, blah, bringing my things, bags to the store, but really, if I want to be honest, in a virtue signaling way, not in a way that I felt deeply that it was going to make a difference. And when I heard Graham Saint talk, I understood for the first time, no, I actually do think that we can make a difference. I actually think there is hope.

[00:10:24.020] - Speaker 1
And if there's hope, then I'm like, Let's get on it. Let's do it. And so I decide I They need to bring all of the food scraps from my restaurants to a farm and make soil, make humus, make soil organic matter. Now, this is easier said than done because farmland in California is crazy expensive, and I had just gotten married in 2013 to my husband, who was undocumented at the time. I did not know that there was no way to get a bank loan if your husband is undocumented. Every bank would say, Yeah, we have programs for that. Then we would get to the end and they'd say, Oh, no, we can't. It took years for me to find a farm, and I got someone to do owner finance, and I get on the land, and I'm going to have a vegan farm. I'm so excited. I'm going to have this vegan farm. I'm going to regenerate the soil. I'm going to keep my vegan integrity intact, and I'm going to have animals, but they're not going to die. My husband was generous in letting me believe that that was a realistic idea. So we start the farm, and I'm getting all the waste from the restaurants, but it's not really breaking down into great compost.

[00:11:36.120] - Speaker 1
I talked to my dad. He's like, You need a cow. A cow is going to set off that compost. So my dad gives me Una, the cow, and Una She goes up. She's already bred. She has a baby shortly after she gets there. We're getting the poop. We're making the compost. This is awesome. I'm breastfeeding my baby, my second child, and I'm feeling so good about myself. Like, look at me. She's more than a year and a I'm still breastfeeding. And my older child, my three-year-old, comes down and asks for some milk. I go to the fridge and I see that we have some of Una's milk that my uncle has been milking off of her two quarters that hang too low for the calf. He's been milking it off by hand. And we have these cork jars and half-gallon jars of her milk in the refrigerator. And I grab a tetra-pack of goat milk from Costco to give to my son because I'm vegan. And I'm holding my baby on my boom. And I was just having that whole self grandizing about how my breast milk is God's perfect food. I'm looking and I'm thinking, well, if my breast milk is God's perfect food, supporting her immune system in this environment that we live in and has all the perfection of God's creation, why is Uta's milk filled with pasta, disgusting, and going to cause cancer?

[00:12:51.860] - Speaker 1
That doesn't make any sense. Why do I believe that? I have this realization in that moment that Uta's milk is raw and it's having all the fight-er immune system benefits that my milk is having, even from a dirtier version of the same environment. So I think I should give my son Buddha's milk, and he doesn't like it. It's not sweet enough because our oak milk and almond milk are all sweetened. So I put a tiny bit of maple syrup in it, and I give it back to him, and he drinks it. And that was the beginning of the crack in the armor. And then I had multiple other things that happened on the farm from buying fertilizer and realizing organic fertilizer is just chicken poop coming out of the consolidated feedlot system, blood meal coming out of the slaughter consolidated feedlot system, the end result, the slaughterhouses, or bone meal, which is coming also out of that system. So all of what we call organic fertilizer is attached to so much death. So then I'm starting to wonder, is there vegan food? So first I'm starting to realize, well, I think that dairy, raw dairy, for sure, has profound benefits for my family.

[00:14:05.380] - Speaker 1
And I'm questioning vegan food as an idea. And we plant 1,000 avocado trees at great expense to our family, and all of a sudden it goes over 110 degrees with crazy Santa Ana winds and the whole orchard dies. So at great expense to ourselves, we replant all of those trees, and then the ground squirrels start taking them out. I'm vegan and I'm scared, but I'm like, get rid of those squirrels. Somebody needs to do something. Then I'm seeing my husband trapping squirrels, and I find a falconer who's going to take the squirrels. I'm like, yes, nature could give the falcon the squirrels. It's going to be awesome. The first day, I dropped 20 squirrels off. And he's like, yeah, I have three falcons, and they each eat one or two squirrels a week. I was like, Oh, okay. So we're back to drowning squirrels or shooting squirrels with a 22 or a small baby gun. There's no getting around it if we want the avocado trees. So then I'm thinking, avocado toast is not vegan because Every avocado farmer had to protect his trees, and then we're trying to keep the buddies away. So you start to realize that there's death in every bite of food, whether you see it on the plate or not.

[00:15:29.780] - Speaker 1
And That was really around 2018, 2019, that I had that full awakening. That was the beginning of the end of me being indoctrinated in the vegan conversation, which then cracked the armor for so many other indoctrinations that I had been fed over the years.

[00:15:51.580] - Speaker 2
Did you ever or have you eaten red meat since your long vegetarian time or still not?

[00:15:58.140] - Speaker 1
I still have not. I'm interested I'm excited about it, but it doesn't really register as food to me yet. My husband is pressuring. He's Mexican. He eats everything that you can imagine, from the guts to the head to the cheeks to the ears to everything. I do consume bone broth. I do consume raw dairy. I do eat eggs in things. I still haven't gotten into just eggs, like scramble eggs. I want to. But again, I was raised just eating a totally different diet. I also want to say, I'm not one of those people that think there's no way to be healthy without animal product. But after having four children from 37 to 45, I was definitely drained To some degree, my hair was breaking. I had given a lot. I've been breastfeeding for 10 years consecutive as of today, still breastfeeding. I feel like adding the dairy and the bone broth has really helped the vitality of my body. But obviously, I'm not saying you can't be healthy without meat because I was largely healthy and had children late in life. But that could also have nothing to do with my diet and have everything to do with that.

[00:17:15.140] - Speaker 1
I've never been vaccinated. I've not been medicated much in my whole life. So it could be that. But I think that eating wholefoods in their whole form is a benefit to the body. I think a diverse diet is better than only eating one thing. But I've seen people cure cancer with a raw vegan diet, and I have seen people cure cancer with a paleo or a carnivore-only diet. So I'm not of the mindset that I have the truth. I think the truth is that there's a design, there's a perfection, there's God's design or spirit or divine intelligence, if you're uncomfortable with that word. But that design is perfect. And so when we eat foods in their a whole form, and that also includes if we're going to eat red meat, also eating the other parts that my husband eats, because we tend to only eat the muscle in our culture. And I'm not sure that that is the healthiest way to do it. And so I make pills out of the liver and the heart and other organs and even the uterus and the female parts of the cow. And I dehydrate that in the freeze dryer and then I capsulate it and I eat that because I do think that the organs have deep nutrition that my body can utilize.

[00:18:33.680] - Speaker 2
How did you decide to open the first restaurant?

[00:18:37.640] - Speaker 1
The recording studio that I had had an SSL board and all this stuff. And literally, just as I was getting off the ground, ProTools became very popular, and also downloading music, stealing music, became very popular. Those two things in a matter of a short two years went from the budgets, you know better than I know, but the budgets just crashed into nothing, and everybody could make an album in their closet. I was paying a house payment on an SSL board, paying for a building, all of these things, and had all of this equipment that was largely obsolete, except for some very specific producers that were still interested in that sound. All of a sudden, my business was wiped out, and I lost the studio eventually. I then went into doing poetry, and I was on HBO Def poetry. I toured the country. I opened for The Roots. I opened for Michael Franty, and I did a lot of college tours of doing poetry. Some of my friends from high school called me and said, We're going to grow weed. Do you want to grow weed with us? I had just I had sold my house, my big, beautiful house, and I had sold my recording studio.

[00:20:05.760] - Speaker 1
I got very related to that. All these people that were my dear friends in the music industry just disappeared. I say that a Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving, I had a Thanksgiving where it was like the game is battling rap battles on my front porch, and there's all the who's who of the hip hop industry at my house for Thanksgiving. The next year, None of those people were in my life anymore. When I had the big, beautiful house and the parties in the recording studio, I would say Jessie Powell and Focus, the producer Focus, are the two people that Jessie Pal until his death and that Focus and I are still friends. We text all the time. But mostly, largely that community that was my everyday life disappeared when I was no longer useful. I went into doing the poetry, touring the country, lived in a tiny little house instead of this big house. My friends called and they said, Let's grow weed. I started growing weed. I was excellent, excellent, excellent at growing weed. And that business grew very quickly. And then I did what I thought you were supposed to do with fast money, which was buy real estate.

[00:21:18.500] - Speaker 1
And then the 2008 collapse happened, and I was upside down on so much real estate. And so my first making money was in the music industry, and then the The music industry crashed. Then my second making money was in marijuana. Then the marijuana industry largely crashed because the economy crashed with the 2008. Everybody that had a house that was trying to save their house started growing weed in their garage. For a little while, I was making money setting up other people's grow rooms. I did a consulting. You wouldn't believe. I mean, judges, state judges, federal judges, everybody was growing weed to save their houses. It was crazy. People would hire me to set their spaces up.

[00:22:06.720] - Speaker 2
I never heard about that before. That's wild. Do you think this was California-specific or this was happening everywhere?

[00:22:12.620] - Speaker 1
It was probably California-specific because of the loose laws around marijuana and medical. It was a gray area. What happened was I was getting $6,000 a pound for indoor Ogie, and I was getting 3,500 for outdoor Ogie, let's say. In a matter of a year, it went down to $1,000 a pound for indoor and $500 or $300 a pound for outdoor. Well, if you have to pay $1,600 to $200 to get someone to trim outdoor, so that was my second make money and lose money and crash of my lifetime. Then my brother-in-law went to prison. My first husband's brother went to prison for marijuana. He flew an airplane to Wisconsin, and We lived across the street from each other. I was married to his brother. We were both in the same industry. All of a sudden, besides the crash that was happening in the industry, I was very hot. The feds were very much around me because he was in federal prison. I remember the night that Obama was elected, I can remember Trevor's in jail in Wisconsin. I'm having to drive these crazy routes to get home and get back to and park and go in places and take a different car out the other side to get to my trib house because I'm being watched.

[00:23:35.200] - Speaker 1
So this was very stressful, to be honest, and I wasn't sure that this was the life that I really wanted. And this same two-week period, one of my dear friends who was also growing marijuana had gotten arrested, and that he was going to have to go to trial, and he had testicular cancer, and he killed himself because he didn't want the chance of having to go to prison with cancer. And he had already had testicular cancer when he was in high school. So he had already gone through the whole fight, and he wasn't interested in doing the fight again. And I didn't know that he had cancer. He called me and four other people the night before. He talked for exactly one hour to each of us. He must have been timing it, had a conversation, and then he drove himself to Kaiser the next day and killed himself on Sunset Boulevard right outside the morgue to not disrupt anybody. So this two-week period was... I was like, I'm not sure I want to grow marijuana anymore. And I put up my brother-in-law's land, but then it gets seized by the government for sale. We start to way downsize our growing operation because the prices are just the bottom is falling out of the market.

[00:24:46.140] - Speaker 1
And I consolidate to just my garage in Rue Nata Hills, where I've already been arrested once. So I don't really want to be growing there. But I also can't afford all these mortgages. Some are going to take it, some we're trying to sell. And so we way consolidate. And I'm just, what am I going to do with my life? I was making all this money. I have all this real estate. It's all upside down. I'm trying to renegotiate some of them, but you can only renegotiate your primary residence. And my best friend, who's an actress, is pregnant, and she's realizing, I can't be an actress where I might get paid a big chunk of money, and then I might not have any money and be responsible for a child. This is just not a realistic way to live life. She moves in with me and my current husband, and we try to decide what can we do with our life? She's having a baby. I don't want to grow pot. This is when we grow this whole huge garden where It was actually, in some ways, this really beautiful time where I had a lot of free time where there was still money to pay for stuff.

[00:25:51.780] - Speaker 1
But we decided during that time, my dad was doing a raw food challenge with Woody Harrelson, and they were seeing how long they could only eat raw food. I think this is before Cafe Gratitude, maybe it's the beginning of Cafe Gratitude, I can't remember. But I start making raw ice cream all the time and experimenting with raw ice cream recipes, raw vegan ice cream made from largely nuts and coconut. And I keep delivering them to Woody Harrelson. He's giving me feedback at his house in LA. And then we decide we're going to start a packaged company. This is before Cocoon Up Bliss or any of these nut-based ice creams existed. Nowadays, packaging is different. But back then, I needed $100,000 to do the first run to buy the packaging and everything. That was all I had. I just couldn't imagine, what if this doesn't work? It's not even a shelf-stable product. What if the freezers go out? So we leave it, we put it to the side, and we keep going on with life, trying to discover other things. And then I guess what we decide at some point is we should open an ice cream shop so we can avoid this $100,000.

[00:27:01.580] - Speaker 1
I thought, I could open an ice cream shop for $15,000. I was wrong, but I thought that. I opened a vegan ice cream shop on Coanga in North Hollywood, and people love it. But I realized very quickly that there is no possible way to make a living off of vegan ice cream. It's a very narrow market. There's vegetarians who still eat ice cream, there's vegans, and then there's certain sects of Judaism that don't eat dairy and meat at the same time. So I have like, acidic Jews and vegans is my whole market, and it's not enough of a market. And these two Palestinian guys walk into my ice cream shop one night, and they tell me they're opening a vegan restaurant in Echo Park, and they don't know anything about vegan food, but they have this great chef, they're going to do it. And they want me to just do the coffee and the ice cream kiosk at the front of the restaurant and have it ultimately be a separate business. But people could either pay me directly if they're just coming in to get a smoothie, or they'll pay me at the end of the month for whatever gets paid on the checks in the restaurant.

[00:28:08.220] - Speaker 1
I wasn't the original owner of Sage. I just had this kiosk at the front of the restaurant, but I was the only vegan involved. These guys, I'm grateful for them coming into my life. Everything I have is because of that interaction. But as far as integrity in business with me, they did not have a lot. Integrity with the ingredients, even being vegan, they were getting these vegan croissants, which are $2. 50 each. Then they were like, We should just get the croissants at Costco because who knows the difference? I'm like, You guys are going to send someone to the hospital. You can't do this. They didn't take very excellently to a woman telling them what to do. My idea was like, I should buy it and be their partner because then they're going to respect what I have to say. I didn't quite realize that it was a little different than that, and that was not going to change anything. I bought into their business, and they told me I could buy the whole business for $100,000. I said, Great, I'm going to give you $70,000 now. Then, I didn't say, My next harvest, I'm going to give you $40,000 more.

[00:29:11.120] - Speaker 1
Basically, when I gave them the next set of cash, they just changed their mind and said, We're going to stay partners with you or not. I was like, Wait, no, that was not the deal. You would have all my cash. I had to get a lawyer. We had to do a contract. I ended up buying them out. I needed to borrow $130,000 from a relative. I was naive and kind, and I'd cosign the car for them because their credit was bad and all these things that happened. But my husband and all my children and Sage Vegan Bistro was a fruit of that relationship. Sometimes, even when a relationship feels painful or disrespectful or not ideal, there's something so beautiful on the other side, and you just have to trust that God has a plan and you can't see all the moving parts. Then right after that, the chef acted out and was yelling and throwing things. My current husband, who was not my husband at the time, was a very young up and coming Sioux chef. He quit one day because the guy threw a box of soy milk at his head. I called him and said, If I fire chef, will you come back?

[00:30:26.710] - Speaker 1
And he said, Well, what are we going to do? I said, I'll be the chef. I'm excellent. I've grown up in the vegan world. I can do this. And it's going to be easier for you to come out of the kitchen, and it's going to be a totally different menu. And so we did that. We let him go, and we redid the whole menu. And me and him became friends. He was much younger than me. He would go to the farmer's market with me. He was trying to learn English. He realized pretty soon he had to learn some English. It was going to work out. And so that was the origin story of Sage. And so it It wasn't like I set out to start a restaurant or even to open a restaurant the same week that my dad was opening a restaurant in Los Angeles. It wasn't at all what I set out to do.

[00:31:09.060] - Speaker 2
And then over time, how did Sage build? What happened with that first sage?

[00:31:14.340] - Speaker 1
So when When I was first still partners with Robert and Tony, they got invited to open a juice bar in this Plaza in Culver City. I went to the meeting with them, and they were like, We don't want to do that. I was like, We should definitely I'm going to definitely do this. And they were like, Well, we don't want to do it. I said, Well, let's do it with Sage. And they said, No, no, no, no. This was when we were in the partnership phase. And they said, No. And I said, Yes. And so I kept pushing for that, which was part of the divide between us. And so I was super naive. I signed a terrible lease agreement and everything. But again, Culver City was my crown jewel, my most successful restaurant. It crushed it for 10 full years. It was an awesome endeavor. And I was right that it was a good idea to do it. And so I opened Sage, and I bought out them, and I had no money, and I just signed the lease agreement. It was like, I'm going to raise the money. I'd never raised money before.

[00:32:11.620] - Speaker 1
But I called everybody I knew. I enrolled them in what I was building, this vegan beer garden. Vegan restaurants have largely been small hole in the walls. This is going to be a big, beautiful patio and 24 taps of local beer. And I got Woody Harrelson, Jason Mraz to invest. And then once I got them, It's funny. People are like, Oh, they did it. I'll do it. And so I raised all the money. And I never built a restaurant. It was just a box. I just got an empty box in a brand new plaza. And I built the whole restaurant. So a lot of learning. And then I went from... After I opened Culver City, I ended up marrying my husband. And then we opened Pasadita, and then eventually, Agora Hills. So that is the history of how sage unfolded. And it was this awesome phenomenon for a lot of years in LA, and I'm so grateful for all of the support and how it all unfolded.

[00:33:08.320] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of Cafe Gratitude.

[00:33:13.080] - Speaker 1
Cafe Gratitude was my father's restaurant. My family was in the garment industry, and my mother, she loved linen. She designed linen clothing for middle-aged women. She had a company called Flacks. It was very popular in boutiques and Bloomingdale's and all of these things. And my parents were married 23 years. They moved to San Francisco. And in full disclosure, they were escaping an affair that my mother was having. And so that doesn't work. You can't geographically escape. So my father, in his mid-fourties, found himself. The business that he had put his life into was his wife's clothing company, and his kids were grown. I was 23, and my brother was 21. And all of a sudden, he had this totally opened up life. And my dad got super into Landmark Forum and did a bunch of Landmark. And he said, That's cool, but not everybody's going to go to a seminar and do the work. How can the work exist out in the world? So I think that Cafe Gratitude started out of an SELP project that he made the game, that Cafe Gratitude was based on this game that encouraged people when they're coming together to have conversations rooted in something more profound than the weather or what they ate for breakfast or what we can go into the mundane And so he designed the game, and then he had this idea, well, what if the game could be a cafe?

[00:34:52.740] - Speaker 1
And then they opened the first Harrison Street Cafe Gratitude in San Francisco and continued to There have been many restaurants in San Francisco during that time. And it grew faster than the economics of the restaurant could support. And people were so excited about it, and it was so cool. But then I think they over expanded in the San Francisco area all the way up to San Rafael and all of that. Then at that time, some people from LA were up there dealing with some family stuff. At the same time, they were considering consolidating, and they decided to partner with my parents, my father and my stepmother, who brought Cafe Gratitude into the world to bring it to LA.

[00:35:42.740] - Speaker 2
What made Cafe Gratitude, Cafe Gratitude?

[00:35:45.700] - Speaker 1
All of it was about affirmations that your thoughts, speech, belief, actions, and attitudes are constantly expressing as your life. And so if that is true, and my father asserts it's true, and I was raised in that conversation. So I guess that I also have found it to be true as well. And so every time you ordered food, it was, I am nourished, I am abundant, I am whole. And the idea would be that people that wouldn't necessarily go and do affirmations in the mirror or have that spiritual work be part of their life would have the opportunity to just have a small piece of it in their every day of having a lunch. And then there was other things. They had the gratitude bowl, which you could pay whatever you wanted. So let's say you felt very abundant, you could pay $100 for it, and a guy that was homeless could come in and pay 50 cents for it. And so this was also a sharing economy in a way that people that were feeling abundance could share abundance with people that weren't remembering their abundance, and therefore, that could trickle into the world of people remembering that the giving and the receiving are actually the same action.

[00:37:00.000] - Speaker 2
What was the dietary style of the restaurant?

[00:37:02.300] - Speaker 1
It was raw vegan at first. It was very strict raw vegan, and then they added cooked foods at some point to the menu. But it always was vegan, and it still is vegan. I think they've closed a lot of them, but there's still several in Los Angeles. And there's also Gracias Madre, which is also my father's creation, an honoring of Latino community that farmed on his farm and lived in the Mission area where the first Catholic Gratitude was. And so Gracias Madre, Thank You, Mother, is a Mexican version, and it's more in a gratitude prayer with Catholic imagery of the mother and all of that.

[00:37:46.580] - Speaker 2
Do you remember going to the restaurant when you were younger?

[00:37:49.680] - Speaker 1
Well, I was not that. I was 23, and I got braces, and the dentist that I was using was up in San Francisco. So I would fly up there every 60 days to get my braces managed. And so I spent a lot of time up in the restaurant and saw it grow and was really proud of what my father was doing. And so I remember it being such a phenomenon and a totally different phenomenon in San Francisco than it was when it came to LA. It was this completely... Everybody that would be in the mission in San Francisco, and you could go in and there could be celebrities and homeless people and bikers and people with all types of piercings in their face. There was not a type of person that went to Cafe Gratitude. It was this cultural phenomenon. And when it came to LA, it was very much as the who's who to be seen. It was a very different vibe than the original Cafe Gratitude that was in the mission. The divorce with my parents, in a lot of ways, brought me much closer to my father. I don't think my father was emotionally vulnerable with me when I was younger, and he was a good father and all of that.

[00:39:05.490] - Speaker 1
But I became this very close friend to my father in the losing my mother and in the processing that and the calling me and talking about it, that we created a bond that I would say is, to this day, my father calls me several times a week, and he's definitely my best friend and business business confidante and everything. So I think that that was the beginning, his divorce from my mother and then remarrying my stepmother and this business and my braces. All of this fostered this amazing relationship that I have with my father today at 47 years old. When I think of my father being with my mother for his whole life, that would have been fine, too. But my mother was definitely the star of the show, and his whole life was in service of her design business, her everything that she did. I think that he got to create on his own in his own creativity. I was deeply proud of him for that and deeply proud of him for creating a new marriage that was better than the first. And not that the first was bad. In 23 years, they raised us.

[00:40:20.440] - Speaker 1
They were extraordinary parents. I do remember it and with a lot of pride for his rebirth after... Because some people could have It's been like, I'm 47 years old, I'm divorced, and I gave my whole life to my ex-wife's business, and I got this several million dollars in the divorce settlement, and I'm just going to be done. But that was not what my father did. He went out on the skinny branches and created business. Then that was not even the last business he created.

[00:40:50.860] - Speaker 2
I can remember going to Cafe Gratitude in San Francisco. I was a vegan at the time, and I remember, let's say, the beetroot salad, for example, was called I am beautiful. I remember saying, I'll have the beetroot salad. The waiter said, I am, and waited for me to say, I am beautiful. I said, I'll have the beetroot salad. He was very insistent on me saying, I am beautiful if I wanted to get the food. I just remember thinking, this is unlike any restaurant experience I've ever had before.

[00:41:27.540] - Speaker 1
Then when he delivered it, he said, You are beautiful.

[00:41:30.000] - Speaker 2
Yes. Do you remember how customers at Cafe Gratitude felt about ordering from the menu the first time they came, what that experience was like? Do you remember anything about that?

[00:41:43.380] - Speaker 1
Very uncomfortable. Very, very, very uncomfortable. They definitely toned it down some for Los Angeles. The Los Angeles version of the restaurants were definitely toned down from the San Francisco version. But also, I mean, so much, there's so many beautiful stories stories of people coming and having a connecting conversation, especially in San Francisco, they used to have the cards from the board game on the table. And so you could ask these deep and profound questions to the people you're having dinner with, which created connection. And you just come to a table to deliver some food, and you'd see that people are teary-eyed and having a connection. And the more that we can create that connection in the world, the better. And so I think that it was a brave thing to do in a world where the market wants to make everybody comfortable. We pray to the God of comfort in so many ways and convenience in our culture. I think it was brave to have a restaurant that says, We're going to actually do something. It's going to make people a little uncomfortable, but we believe that that is making a difference, and so let's go.

[00:42:53.080] - Speaker 1
People would say stuff like, I'm from New York, and this is ridiculous, and I'd laugh and I'd say, Well, everybody that started Cafe Gratitude also from New York. So your identity from New York doesn't need to hate affirmations. But yeah, it was an interesting thing. It was interesting to have a competitive business with my parents because you would hear... I would get to hear the upset or who would come to me to tell me, and they would get the upset like, Oh, I'm never going to stage again. This happened, and I'm never going to gratitude again. So it was interesting to be so close in proximity with them having the five restaurants and me having five restaurants in LA. It It was an interesting dynamic. People would always come in and say, Do you get along with your father? I was like, Yeah. Are you guys competitive? Yeah. My dad, for years, called me every morning and said, What were the numbers, baby? I'd be like, Do you want me to I'm going to send you the sales report? And he's like, No, what would the fun of that be? I didn't look at the sales report yet.

[00:43:50.260] - Speaker 1
And I look on my phone and I'd say, Oh, Calvary City did this. And he'd say, Venice did this. I'd say, Echo Park did this. He'd say, Largemont did this. Pasadena did this. Beverly Hills did And so we would go over the numbers. And they were way ahead of me in the beginning because they had way more resources than me. And I was selling eighths of weed to get my first restaurant off the ground. And they had big investors. And then I, at a certain point, surpassed what they were doing. Pre-pandemic, it was crazy what I was doing. And we were selling the restaurants for a ton of money. And then we got closed for two and a half years. And the bureaucracy stole 15 years of my life. But I'm not I'm going to be a victim. I'm going to trust that it's all in my benefit. Whatever is happening is in my benefit.

[00:44:35.420] - Speaker 2
Do you know when your parents became vegan?

[00:44:39.040] - Speaker 1
My father was always a pescetarian, as far as I can remember my whole childhood. My mother read a book in college about factory farming, and it was appalling. And she made a decision that she wasn't going to eat meat ever again. So when she was pregnant with me, she was not eating meat. And I think my father went along with her view of life. But because my father grew up half in Plattsberg, New York, and half in Maine in the summertime, I think that he had an affinity for fish And so he always kept fish in his diet, but ultimately not in the house. We were vegan at home. And then one time my mom was making cookies for us, and she ran to the corner store in the country where we lived at Pips and bought some And then she got distracted and she had left the margarine with the pilot light getting soft in the oven overnight. And it turned to a plastic sheet. And she was just like, This is crazy. We're never eating this again. So we were vegan except for butter for my whole childhood. They did introduce some dairy, I would say, around my turning 12 or 13.

[00:45:53.440] - Speaker 1
But I was vegetarian my whole life. And my mother is still vegetarian to this day.

[00:46:00.000] - Speaker 2
Growing up in New York, having parents who were essentially vegetarian, was that a strange upbringing for the culture that you were in?

[00:46:10.580] - Speaker 1
I grew up in Ithaca, New York, so it's super hippy liberal. So it was strange, but not so strange. My mom is an identical twin, and my mom and my dad married brothers. I had four parents. When your mom is a twin, you have two moms. And so my mom's twin sister worked at the natural food co-op. So I guess I didn't feel like it was that weird because the community that was around us, it was pretty accepted. I went to Waldorf School. There was always a vegetarian option for the lunch stuff at Waldorf School. What was the weirdest was the no sugar. And to be truthful, I haven't been able to raise my kids with no sugar because I didn't like going to birthday parties and having to bring some weird carob cake thing that and everybody else is eating McDonald's cake or whatever. I'd say that the weirder thing was the no sugar than the no meat, to be honest.

[00:47:10.660] - Speaker 2
What was the motivation for your move to Texas?

[00:47:15.380] - Speaker 1
I bought this place in the beginning of '22. And in full disclosure, I believed life would go back to normal. The restaurants would start making money again, and I should buy a place in Texas. And Texas is open, so I should open some restaurants in Texas. I thought, I'm going to find someplace close to between Austin and San Antonio and open restaurants. And veganism is still at its infancy in Texas. It's still a new thing. It still has legs. It's truthfully, veganism is dying in LA, and people are going to keto and all these other things. I, personally, inside, was not vegan anymore. I was not dying I'm not inspired about it, but I thought I might as well expand the empire so that I can sell it for more when the life goes back to normal, and we're doing $7-$9 million a store. I obviously did not know that life would never go back to normal, that LA would never be the same. That we retrained humanity to eat at home. We retrained humanity to date on the internet, date by swiping left, swiping right, and by not letting people go out to eat for two and a It made it totally acceptable to Netflix and chill.

[00:48:33.740] - Speaker 1
And so a huge percentage of dating people stopped going out to eat in the traditional way. And then many family members didn't go back to work. So we used to have early family dinner and then late date dinner. Well, both early family dinner and late date dinner and lunch, business lunch, were all gutded, even when the pandemic was over because the culture had changed. And so because of that, it never went back to normal. And the restaurant industry is not the same. It's not the same at Gracias Madre. It's not the same at Cafe Gratitude. It's not the same at my restaurant. My brother, Cary, started a restaurant called Highly Likely, and he's found a niche of artists and people that don't really conform to these things. That's been his audience, and he's largely done well. But of all of our family restaurants from Gratitude, Sage, Gracias Madre, and Highly Likely, which are the family of restaurants that my siblings and parents own, highly likely is the only one that has expanded in this time and the only one that is having quarter over quarter growth. It's to a very young audience.

[00:49:44.100] - Speaker 2
Is that a vegan restaurant as well?

[00:49:46.620] - Speaker 1
It's not. But lots of non-vegan restaurants are also struggling. I talk to people that have restaurants for 30 years that are burning through their retirement right now and don't know what to do and can't pull the plug because they've had these employees for all this time. It's really a sad situation in the restaurant industry in Los Angeles. And so ultimately, I bought this place thinking that I would open restaurants in Austin and San Antonio. And then I just started to see how bad the sales were and how much we were bleeding during the pandemic. And I thought, why can't use any money to do that? I have stores that were making cash flowing so much money, losing a million plus dollars a year. I have 350 employees. I'm firing people, laying people off. I ended up having this farm that I bought in order to service the restaurants I was going to open because the farm had to come first in this model of farm and table. I own this farm in Texas, and I owned this farm in California. This county comes out to my property in California because I let this homeless family stay in an on my property during COVID, remote school, and they didn't have internet.

[00:51:04.110] - Speaker 1
Their kids, their six kids, living in an RV. I get the wife a job, I get the husband a job, and I let them live on my property. A neighbor reports me for letting someone live on an RV in my property. Which then opens up this whole can of worms. They come onto my property and they say they want everything brought up to code. This farm started in 1884. And so millions of dollars. They just stroke of a bureaucrat's pen. And the farm is actually doing It's great. It's starting to grow during the pandemic. I thought, this is awesome. People are really interested in farm to table. But once you could go back in Whole Foods and you did have to wear a mask and everything, you would be amazed how quick people didn't care about farm to table at all. I was doing 500 boxes during the pandemic of delivering direct to people's houses. I actually bought more land during the pandemic. I thought farming is good. People are reinvigorated about this idea of regenerative farming and all of this. And I start to run out of money, and I realized I can't keep it all afloat.

[00:52:09.240] - Speaker 1
I got to sell California Farm. And I have to sell California Farm because I don't feel like there's a possibility to make money here. And so I make the hard decision. I have to sell my farms. I start selling. They sell one farm, another. At my farm, which has all the violations, I'm like, Dear Lord, please send me a buyer that's going to pay cash, and they're going to keep my employees, and they're going to keep it all in regenerative agriculture. I forgot to ask it not to be a huge pharmaceutical heir, but somebody bought my farm. They kept my employees. To this day, they still have my employees. They kept it regenerative. And yes, they are an heir to a huge pharmaceutical company that made vaccines during the pandemic. So weird turn of events. And I decided I decided to move to Texas, to this land, because I thought there was more possibility with less regulations. I needed a big chunk of money. I had no money. The restaurants were losing money. I didn't know what to do. I just prayed on my knees, God, please. I'm Sorry to ask, but I need you to drop a pile of money on me.

[00:53:18.930] - Speaker 1
I was crying. I'm looking at my kids. I'm looking at them in the bed. I know there's equity in my farm. I know I have this place in Texas. I just don't know how to get there. In the middle of the night, my phone, bing, and it's Kanye West. I had asked him if he wanted to invest in this project that we're doing here because we were raising money. We're still raising money to finish this hospitality project here. But he wrote, I'm not investing in anything that's not me right now. And I said, Okay, I understand that. I respect that. And then he wrote, So just send me an invoice for consulting. And I was like, For consulting? What? He's like, I'm going to get a farm and you could consult, or you could consult on my Wyoming ranch. I said, For how much? He said, The higher amount. I went back to see what my text said. My text said, The minimum investment is $25,000. The maximum is $300,000 because liquor license, I don't want anybody to owe more than 10% because it gets complicated when you need to renew stuff with the liquor license.

[00:54:19.920] - Speaker 1
I wrote $300,000. He said, Yeah. And he gave me the guy's information to submit the invoice. I submitted the invoice. And honestly, I was still not 100% I got positive that he was going to send me this money. I have a relationship with him that was not... I mean, it's long. We met when I did HBO deaf poetry. We filmed the same day, but it's not close. We had just seen each other recently when I had sent that text message, but we hadn't seen each other or talked in 10 or 15 years before that. I didn't know for sure, but I thought the Lord works in mysterious ways. Two weeks go by and I hadn't received any money. I was like, Well, I guess it's not going to happen. My friend said, Well, why don't you just text the guy that you sent the invoice to or email him and say, Hey, I've never done business with Kanye. How long does it take for him, his check runs to go through. And so I did that. And the guy called me right back and said, I'm so sorry we missed your invoice. I'm going to wire it to you on Friday.

[00:55:23.300] - Speaker 1
I have another other wires that are going out on Friday. I sent Kanye a couple of ideas and and I never heard back from him, and his phone number changed, and I've never heard from him again. I don't think it's personal, but he's busy in doing his life. And so he gave me this most beautiful gift of giving me the ability to move all that equipment, all my animals, my cows, my pings, my horses, my greenhouses, my tractors, and pick up that farm in California and drop it here in Texas. And I'm forever grateful for that and forever We're grateful to divine intelligence and to Kanye for participating in that way.

[00:56:06.660] - Speaker 2
Have you always been a person of faith?

[00:56:10.160] - Speaker 1
I've always been a spiritual person. My parents raised me in that your thoughts, speech, beliefs, actions, and attitudes are always the divine expressing, and you have to be mindful of that. I feel like the closer I get to nature, the closer I feel to God, And the more I realize that our ego and our desire for domination has us missing the most precious parts of life. So I would say that my faith has grown stronger through the years. But I think I've always, I've always prayed. I've always been mindful of how God expresses through us and in us.

[00:56:59.800] - Speaker 2
What What have you learned about nature since having a regenerative farm?

[00:57:06.940] - Speaker 1
She never lies. And that's the whole concept of my book, is that I just started to... The veganism was the first crack There is no veganism. The lion eats the gazelle, but when the lion dies, the grass eats the lion. The microbes feed the fat to the grass. That there is no veganism. That our purpose, and this is going to I'm not crazy to most people in my world, and people have been very upset for me for saying it recently, but all mammals, every single one of them, prioritize clean water, clean food, and reproduction, and some prioritize shelter. We are very good at shelter and comfort, but we have largely abandoned our water, we have abandoned our food, and we have abandoned reproduction. And think about for me to be here, how many ancestors had to fight, toil in the sun, work so hard to feed their children, to feed themselves, and to live in much harder conditions than anything I will ever experience in my lifetime. I almost didn't pass that gift on because I was so busy being busy, so concerned about how can I make sure that I am successful that I get written about, that there's a picture of me in a chef's coat with my arms crossed on whatever magazine, that I almost missed the opportunity to be a mother.

[00:58:39.560] - Speaker 1
I'm just so grateful that I didn't miss that opportunity. I would That way that having children and the way that I ended up having children and the way God spoke to me and directed me and that has brought my faith to another level for sure.

[00:58:55.620] - Speaker 2
Do you think if it wasn't for COVID, none of this would have happened?

[00:59:00.600] - Speaker 1
I don't know about none of it. My coming to being pro-life happened in a mushroom journey far before COVID. When I was 30-ish, 30-something, I was still married to my first husband, I think. I went to a gathering at my dad's bar where he had a Agua Lita, a grandmother from Mexico. There's 13 Indigenous grandmothers that preside over Indigenous medicine, and they're the caretaker for Indigenous medicine. They meet a couple of times a year and try to save these traditions in a world that maybe doesn't respect them or honor them anymore. So they were doing a mushroom tea gathering at my father's farm. I was invited up. I went. And very quickly after drinking the tea, my uncle was walking across the field and he's a little hunched over. And his body went from being hunched over like an elderly man to a fetus. They didn't do a young boy, they didn't do a young man, and they didn't do an old man. And it kept doing that across the field. And then all of a sudden, I see this whole blanket of threads, like beautiful light, threads of light that were wove the entire blanket together.

[01:00:18.120] - Speaker 1
It was all of life and how it was all intertwined and interconnected perfectly. Then the blanket swept up into the air and under the blanket, there was all these vacuums, sucking soul's threads out of the blanket and pulling it, pulling it, pulling it, pulling it, pulling it, pulling it, making the blanket not be the same as it was because all these lives were being pulled out of it. It got really dark and really bad. I was crying. I didn't know. I said, What do you want? What do you want from me? Just blood and guts and fetuses and everything. I had had two abortions in my early 20s, and I never thought about them again, treated it like a root canal. The voice He said, Do you believe in divine intelligence? I said, Yes. The voice said that it wasn't your choice to make. I can see more than you can see. Your view is limited. Then the voice said, The mother The Father and the Father and the child is the Holy Trinity, the foundation. You must keep that intact. I was like, I'm not even in touch with this person I had the baby with.

[01:01:27.120] - Speaker 1
I don't know what you want from me. I got frustrated after a while because it was dark and it seemed like a long time that there's just going on. I was like, I don't know what you want. Then it got all light and white and arms of love of a parent that knows that you've done something wrong, but total forgiveness, total understanding, total value for seeing you. The voice said, promise to never do it again and never use your words to encourage anybody to do it. I literally in my head said, I can do that, but I'm not going to be pro-life. I'm not. I was so liberal, so, so liberal that I said that. I didn't tell anybody about this vision or hallucination. I went about my life and I opened more restaurants and dorsed my husband, and I put it out of my mind. I didn't even tell anybody about it until my father had an experience on ayahuasca, where he called me to tell me that the voice had told him to reverse his vasectomy and that What he had done was wrong with my mother, having abortions with my mother, and that he had to promise to never use his words.

[01:02:37.050] - Speaker 1
Same words came through the ayahuasca that came through the mushrooms. So that was the first person I told about it was when my dad told me that. I told him. Then years go by, I'm opening Culver City, I'm divorcing my ex-husband, and my ex-husband had a very hard time with his brother being in prison. His best friend died of a drug interaction, and he was drunk in the restaurant one night and end up spitting in my face. I want to say he's a very good man, and it was a bad moment for him in his life. I went to the kitchen crying, and a young cook that I was friends with brought me a margarita I never drink. He said, Drink this. The Huffington Post is outside waiting to interview me about what is it like to be business partners with Woody Harrelson and Jason Mraz and how's this new restaurant going? I'm crying behind the pizza oven. The cook goes and gets me another margarita, and I drink it. I pull myself together and go do the interview. My husband's roommate come and get him, and I make it through the night. And that cook then says, Well, I'm going to come and drive you home because I've never seen you drink before.

[01:03:47.860] - Speaker 1
So I don't think that you should drink and drive. One thing leads to another. In a very vulnerable moment, I sleep with it. I then the next morning immediately regret it, tell him I'm so sorry, I apologize. Please go back to your girlfriend at the host stand and never think of me again. And two weeks later, I'm pregnant, and I know what I need to do. I literally know that I need to marry this person who doesn't speak English, who's undocumented, who's 13 years younger than me, who has nothing in common with me. Nothing. I promise God, Mother, Father, Child, Holy Trinity, keep it intact. And it's so hard because I have investors and I have... There's like, employees and all this stuff, and I feel shame and embarrassment. I don't even know what to do. But I go to the restaurant, I tell him, and it's interesting is that his father... His father was one of 27 children that was spawned up and down the Coast of Wato'o, Oaxaca, like that. So his father always said to him, You could never leave your child. If you get someone pregnant, you could never leave them.

[01:05:01.300] - Speaker 1
God working in my favor, years and years before this was ever a thing, he had been indoctrinated every meal, every family meeting, every interaction, you never leave your child. So he agreed that we needed to get married. We got married two weeks later on Thanksgiving Day. Our vows were something like, this may seem crazy to you guys, but we think it's what's best for our family. We ask that the community doesn't diminish this and supports it. If either one of us comes to you saying it's a hard time, please support us. We had the community say, I do. Then we said, We commit to be the best parents that we could be and get to know each other and build this family the best we can. I don't know, what are you going to say about this marriage? We got married, and it was super awkward, and he got drunk with all the cooks on one side of the yard, and I was sitting on the other side of the yard with my dad and my stepmom on a bench thinking, What have I done? What is going on here? And awkward December, awkward Christmas.

[01:06:08.200] - Speaker 1
There's this before Instagram and Twitter where you could just go in your own world and scroll. So we're trying to find things that we can watch on TV together. We're watching animal shows because basically, he can follow along with the animal shows. And then we lose the baby in January. So I got pregnant in October, married in November, Christmas, and we lose the baby. I think, Lord, I have been completely obedient. I don't understand this level of radical faith and obedience should be rewarded in my small human mind. Most of my friends are basically telling me, like celebrating, like you can get out of this, Molly. It's less than six months. You just get it annulled. It doesn't exist. Just be done. And we go to this Indian family, huge Indian family comes to Sage in Culver City. They rent out the whole restaurant for the evening, and they do this big vegetarian buffet. And they ask the cooks and the chefs to come out and to be acknowledged. And out of politeness, I'm standing at the front where the couple that's doing their 50th wedding anniversary that are the matriarch and patriarch of the 100 and something people in the room.

[01:07:28.460] - Speaker 1
I say politely, Tell me the secret to 50 years of marriage. She said, Well, we were an arranged marriage, so we've always been building for tomorrow. We're always putting our family, our community, and our business at the center of our marriage, and we built our love inside of that. Okay, God. So we decided that that baby arranged our marriage, and this is what we were meant to do. We stayed married. Thirteen years later, we We still are married. We have four children. It's an exquisite life. And during COVID, a young man, high school student, showed up at my farm, Ozebar, that was an unaccompanied minor that came to renew a night with his family during the Trump administration. He borrowed money and he took an Uber to my farm to volunteer during COVID. He had seen me on YouTube and he felt like he belonged with our family. He felt like he belonged, that there was some connection between me and him. We ended up taking custody of him. He lived with us pretty much almost immediately. I believe that that's the soul that I aborted was brought back to me 20 years later as a gift for my obedience.

[01:08:49.620] - Speaker 2
That's wild. Incredible story.

[01:08:53.080] - Speaker 1
But I suspect that if I had sold my businesses and got a huge chunk of money and been able to just do what we wanted to do, there's a part of what my husband brings to the marriage and what masculinity brings to the marriage that I never would have fully appreciated. And I It would have felt like it was something that I did that made us our money and that I would have not thought it out loud. It would have been on the underneath, and it would have impacted our ability to be in balance. I suspect that it would have been harder for us to stay married. I think that whatever we're building here now, we're building it together from the ground up, and we are equal partners, and it wasn't like he came into something that I had already built. I get to value the masculinity that he brings in a way that the feminist in me I didn't value. I don't know what would have happened if COVID didn't happen. I can't say, but I try to believe and understand that there is something that's of value for my children, for my husband, for my marriage that came out of not getting that windfall.

[01:10:20.740] - Speaker 1
I've lost everything before, the music industry, the pot industry, and I've always built it back bigger and better. I have faith that what I'm doing here on the Ranch, people are interested about it. People want to come to natural spaces, want to eat regenerative food, want to stay in a space that is on organic cotton sheets with no Wi-Fi and experience hearing the crickets at night time. I believe that people want that, and I believe that I'm bringing value to the community, even if it's not monetized exactly how I wanted it to yet.

[01:10:55.680] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the model for your farm.

[01:10:59.200] - Speaker 1
We have 206 acres, and we're living here in community with my brother and his wife. My brother-in-law, well, he actually just moved to Austin, but the brother-in-law that was in prison, he always joked that I divorced his brother, but I didn't divorce him. When he got out of prison, he had to live with me because of the agreements or whatever. Then he literally just... I just kept him. But he just got married, so he just moved to Austin. He was living here. Then we have my husband's brother and cousin that That stay 10 months out of the year helping on the farm with a visa from Mexico. Then we have some other people that live on the farm. There's the community. There's about 22 of us that live here. That's a mix of family and workers and work trade people that want to be here and learn. Then we have 40 beds of hospitality. Let's say you were like, I want to have a retreat of artists in central Texas, and I want us to eat only regenerative food, and I'm going to invite my friends. You could come here and we have different spaces.

[01:12:04.010] - Speaker 1
We have an outdoor stage on the field that has a 4,000-square-foot shade structure. Then we have a yurt, which is just for 50 people. Then we have a conference room for 250 to 300 people with a stage. We do small music festivals, we do yoga retreats, there's something called influencer retreats where a brand brings all their influencers together to make content. We do meds work, coming of age work, church retreats, baby showers, family reunions, weddings, all of that. We have 40 beds, and we have these different venues. Then we have an organic restaurant that's on the farm that only serves protein from the range. If you come and you get a Patty Belt today at the restaurant, it's from a cow that we knew we raised, we didn't vaccinate, and is on this land the whole time. I believe that there's a coherency in food that's grown on the land that you are on. And so I believe that there's a ripple effect. If you come here and you eat a burger from here, you have a feeling when you leave that is a remembering of that divine cycle that God has a design. And so that's what we're doing.

[01:13:15.500] - Speaker 1
And we do farm tours. We have pigs, goats, sheep, and cows, dairy, and beef.

[01:13:22.940] - Speaker 2
I heard that you call your burger the What's Possible Burger. Is that right?

[01:13:27.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, sir. What's Possible when man and bovine and grass and microbiology all work together, what's possible is regeneration.

[01:13:38.760] - Speaker 2
And what's in the What's Possible burger?

[01:13:41.180] - Speaker 1
It's a Patty Belt. It's sourdough bread that's 20% brown wheat. We get the wheat berries and we grind it. And so you're having all the nutrients and then 80% organic white because people are still not 100% on the 100% wheat yet. And then we have that bread and then we make it sourdough long, fermented over a day and a half. And then it has a long-fermented kimchi, red onions, and organic grass-fed cheddar, and the burger, and organic mustard. And that is what's on the What's Possible burger.

[01:14:14.500] - Speaker 2
Tell me more about local food versus food that travels to you. What do you think the benefits of local food are?

[01:14:21.540] - Speaker 1
I think that there's a large, growing body of evidence that water has memory. There's beta Austin, there's other scientists scientists that are proving that water has memory. And so food is largely water when it's growing, and we are largely water. And so I believe that our food is being informed by our environment, that the water is remembering what is in the environment and then is informing that food. And that food is then informing your mitochondria and your epigenetics. And so this food that is coherent with your environment, I believe, is turning on the cells that fight cancer and turning off the cells that make cancer or diabetes or any of those things. And then on another note, and I don't know Some people are science believers and some people are biblical believers, and some people are spiritual. But in the Bible, God picked up some soil and he blew it, and then he made Adam, and he blew into Adam's nose and made man. In In science, it shows us that the microbiology in a healthy gut and the microbiology in healthy soil are 73% the same DNA. So whether you're staunchly believing in science or you're staunchly believing in the Bible, either way, I think it's clear that we are meant to live with the soil and of the soil.

[01:15:53.660] - Speaker 1
So on another level, eating of your local environment that has not been sterilized and packaged and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, is replenishing that microbiology that's in your gut. If you think about our language, how many ways do we say to trust your gut, your gutterl instinct, trust with your gut, go with your gut? What if that microbiology, the foundation of all of life, soil, that is a little piece of creation in you, informing you. And that the more distant we get from that microbiology and the more we get this industrial microbiome that's in our guts, we can't We can't trust our guts. And then we can't trust ourselves, and then we can't trust each other. And then we invite the government to be in every single interaction. What if that reconnecting with healthy soil is so much bigger than just our microbiology and our mental health and all of the things that we know are so important? But what if it's actually reconnecting with the creator, with that voice inside of us? I want to invite people wherever you are to get your hands in soil, because I I think that that disconnect is having us disconnected from the voice that is always giving us our inspiration, our creativity, and guiding us in life.

[01:17:12.660] - Speaker 1
I believe that that is invaluable and necessary. To me, it's not just a battle of chemical farming, it's a spiritual battle. I believe that soil is at the foundation of that spiritual battle. Even if you're saying, No, I don't It's a scientific battle, then it's a scientific battle worth fighting because the science shows that putting your hands in healthy soil is more effective than any SSRI. What percentage of adults are on SSRIs in this culture? So many. And so the science shows us that reconnecting with the soil is important. I believe that Genesis also asks that of us. And before the Ten Commandments, before anything else, God said to tend to the garden. That is what was asked of us. Very very first thing that was ever spoken into existence, supposedly. He also spoke over the water, arguing my earlier point that water has memory, that the water was there and it was black, and he spoke over it, and he divided the water above and below the ferment and all that. But he spoke into the water, water has memory. And so if water does have memory, or even some believe God consciousness, then what are the ramifications of us constantly poisoning God's consciousness?

[01:18:30.280] - Speaker 1
And so to me, it's twofold. We have to stop poisoning ourselves, the soil and the water in order to win the spiritual battle that's at hand.

[01:18:38.900] - Speaker 2
Can you explain how regenerative farming and industrial farming differ?

[01:18:46.780] - Speaker 1
Yes. We have regenerative farming, we have organic farming, and then we have industrial farming. Organic farming is largely industrial farming and largely degenerative where we just don't use these certain things. We've said these chemicals are okay to use and these chemicals are not okay to use. Regenerative farming is an active practice of working with nature to create healthy soil, understanding that healthy soil is the foundation of all of life. And so there's five principles of regenerative agriculture. The first one is context. Farming within the context of where you are. I should not try to grow papayas in Texas. That's not the best crop for here because winters and all of that. The next is armor or cover crops, keeping the ground covered with either a cover crop or mulch or some armor on the ground so that the mother is modest. She does not want to be exposed. But Ultimately, so that the microbiology can stay alive and have protection. Biodiversity, so a diversity of different kinds of plants, not just having fields of one thing. Also diversity of crops so that you're not fully dependent on one income stream. Then less chemicals or no chemicals, and then no till or less till.

[01:20:09.360] - Speaker 1
Then the last and most important one to me is the animal integration, where you're using animals to do their herd impact on the ground, to recreate what the bison or the antelopes are doing under pressure from predators. They get moved and they stay in these tight pods so that nobody could get them, and therefore they pee and they poop and they saliva in tight areas. And then that is how the grasslands have been grown for millions and millions of years. So we recreate that with what's called holistic plant grazing, mob grazing. And we move our cattle every single day. We move our sheep every single day. We were moving our goats every day, but they are escape artists, and we are having a break on retraining them on a hard fence because we can't get them to stay in the electric fence.

[01:20:55.020] - Speaker 2
Do you follow Joel Salatin's work?

[01:20:57.320] - Speaker 1
I do. So Joel wrote the forward to my book, and I just met him in real life for a first time. We were at the Heritage Foundation in DC a couple of weeks ago as they are trying to make soil health be at the foundation of the conservative party. I largely don't trust government at all. But if a think tank as big as them wants to bring soil health into the middle of the conversation, I will be there at the front row trying to make that happen. We were both there as part of the team that was consulting on what is important in this area. I think he's awesome. I actually didn't want him to write the foreman to my book because we're on the same publisher, and I thought he might just feel obligated, Oh, it's her first book. They're asking me, Let me do it. So I said no. And then they just sent it to him to read, and he reached out and asked me if he could write the foreword. And so I then was like, Of course you can. I want whoever does it to want to do it. It's so weird.

[01:21:59.710] - Speaker 1
This This is my first book, but people are like, Oh, you can't expect people to write a blurb for you. You just have to send them the blurb and ask them to put their name on it. I was like, I don't want a blurb from anybody that didn't read the book. That's crazy. And my book is controversial. A lot of people that are in Hollywood and in a very liberal space are writing blurbs for me. I wouldn't want them to accidentally cosign something and then get some blowback because I'm pro-life or whatever and feel that they didn't know that that was coming for them. And so I wouldn't have wanted to do that. So everybody that wrote a blurb for my book actually read the book, and I didn't write any blurbs for anybody. And so I was like, Oh, you probably have to just write the foreword for someone, too. And I was like, I think I'll find someone who is inspired enough about what I wrote that they want to participate. So that was awesome. And he's just so extraordinary. I write for Epoch Times, which is a newspaper that I I don't know.

[01:23:00.380] - Speaker 1
I think they think themselves centrist. I think they're probably right leading. But I write in the opinion section and just had an article come out called Free the Enslaved Food System, which was about Joel Salatin and his talk at the Heritage Foundation and how he believes it doesn't cost the government anything to roll back all the regulations and free the entrepreneur. If you want to buy milk from your neighbor or you want to buy short courier from your neighbor or whatever, you should have the right to do that. If someone else doesn't feel safe, they can go to Walmart or H-E-B. Those things are not going away, the big grocery stores. But why is it that we need the government in every interaction around our food. If farmers are not free to feed the people, something is wrong. Something is very, very wrong in our society.

[01:23:53.960] - Speaker 2
The book is called Debunked by Nature?

[01:23:56.880] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:23:57.360] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the book.

[01:23:59.260] - Speaker 1
I started with Nature Never Lies, and then we just switched it to that. But I just kept having all these thoughts through COVID about how many little lies I feel like we're forced to tell every day or were asked to tell every day. And it was getting so much louder during COVID. I remember there was this whole thing Latinx, where we were supposed to call all Latin people Latinx because it was non-binary. And my husband looked at me and said, We're not doing that. I was like, We have to. That's what's happening. And he said, Absolutely not. That's white supremacy. We're not changing my entire language. Every word is gendered. Whatever word you're I'm saying it's gendered. It's not like in English where you say he or she before. It's like if I am full in Spanish, full for a female is gen-a, and full for a male is Gen O, every word is gendered. He said, You can't just put X at the end of Latino and make it the language non-gendered. It doesn't make any sense. I was explaining this to someone in the restaurant, a girlfriend of mine who was teaching at LAUSD, and she was like, Oh, I don't know.

[01:25:13.600] - Speaker 1
I don't think you can say that. I was like, Well, but my husband is Mexican and he feels disrespected by it. So I don't think we should be saying it. Have you talked to the parents of the children that you're using this term with? They're largely Catholic from Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras. So I believe that they would not be interested in that terminology. I had employees quit, put on Twitter that I was transphobic. I'm just expressing the views of my husband. But this was just one little lie that we were asked to tell through COVID and that 6 feet insistencing is going to make a difference that wearing a mask when you're standing up, but when you're sitting down, you don't have to. We can't eat at the bar, but you can eat at a table. They just didn't make any sense. There was all these lies we were to pretend were true. Then if you didn't pretend they were true, which I didn't because I grew up in a largely unmedicated household, we didn't, which largely was a liberal thing just as far as I remember growing up, I was unvaccinated I unmedicated. I never went to the hospital my whole life until I got an allergic reaction to lice.

[01:26:21.940] - Speaker 1
I got lice at summer camp and I was allergic to the chemicals that they put on my head to kill the lice, and I ended up going to the hospital and having to be intubated. And the doctor was like, You're actually not allergic. It's poison. It's meant to kill something. And so you are more sensitive to the poison. There's no such thing as being allergic to poison. And so when everybody started saying, You have to wear a mask, healthy people have to wear a mask, I was like, This is a lie. Everything seemed like a lie. And then I'm spending more time in nature because we don't have to go to the restaurant as much because it's not as busy. And these lies are just seeming louder and louder as comparing them to life on the farm. I'm blessed that I had my father and my mother and that they were on the same page because I knew people that were totally isolated from their family. I didn't feel isolated. A few people moved off the farm because they didn't feel like I was taking it seriously. But ultimately, we lived our life totally normal on the farm.

[01:27:22.120] - Speaker 1
The world was all really confusing. I started writing down ideas, and that's how the book started. Then I I ended up getting a couple of people coming out to me when I came out and made my restaurant's regenerative, asked if I wanted to write a book, and I said, Yes, but it's not the book I think that you are thinking of. I sent an outline of seven chapters to the two people that had given me an offer. Chelsea Green basically said, Oh, well, we wouldn't want you to write about transgenderism, abortion, a bunch of the things that were in the book. And Acres, which is largely a farming... This is the first non-farming book they've ever put out, said, We're open to let you write the book however you want to write the book. And so I went with them, which was less money and less support. But I knew that the book I wanted to write was not just an environmentalism book. And so I wrote this book and I took 17 concepts from our society. And not all of them are political. Some of them are breastfeeding or co-sleeping. And I essentially just asserted what nature does with other mammals and how far we've drifted from that.

[01:28:39.360] - Speaker 1
And basically said that nature is telling the truth. And if we want to be truth seekers, which many of us claimed to want to be during COVID, then we should take these constructs, these ideas, and look at them in the construct of the Savannah or the farm or the woods, and ask ourselves, does this happen in nature?

[01:29:01.000] - Speaker 2
It sounds like you're describing all '60s hippie ideals, every one of them. Yes or no? Tell me.

[01:29:07.940] - Speaker 1
I mean, yes and no. I think the rise of feminism and abandoning the true value in the male and female also arose in the '60s. I think that the sexual revolution might have diminished the sanctity of life in some ways. I largely grew up in I mean, I had an aunt tell me, You better have sex with as many guys as you can when you look as hot as you do right now, because believe me, after you have babies, you're not going to feel as hot. Like, weird things that I would never say to my daughter now. I think that all the ideas of the '60s were beautiful. Then just like veganism was probably beautiful, just like diversity, equity, inclusion was probably beautiful. But they've all been twisted into ideas that caused separation liberation, division, and a forgetting of our divine purpose. Many beautiful things came out of the '60s and then were twisted and used for division. I think that that's also true for the civil rights movement. I think that's true for many different movements. I think that we live in a world right now where we act like gender is non-binary and race is fixed.

[01:30:27.680] - Speaker 1
I would argue that both Both of those are lies, that gender or sex at birth is fixed. I would argue that race is largely a construct, the way we relate to gender in our current society. Race is not real. You can't say what Mexican-Americans believe. You can't say what Black Americans believe. There's no connection between the amount of melanin in your skin and your heritage of your ancestors and what you believe today because it's largely cultural. My husband's a Mexican-American, and I use this example in the book, my friend Junior, he grew up in South LA or East LA and grew up in a very different world than my husband did in a tiny Indigenous village in Oaxaca. They are both Mexican-Americans. They see the world very differently. There is no race that makes them a group. I think that this idea is largely used to divide us. Because if we remember that we, the people, all of us, there's more of us than any of them, that we can actually drive the car in the direction we want. We have the collective power of the purse. We have the collective power of our mind and our speech and our thoughts and our actions and our attitudes.

[01:31:47.760] - Speaker 1
But if we're arguing with each other about when life begins, about microaggressions, about DEI policies, you know what we're not doing? We're not collectively coming together and saying we're all being poisoned and our reproductive abilities are being taken away from us. We want to argue whether you can kill your baby or not, when I think we should all be arguing for the rights of our future generations to be able to have a baby. I think that many of these ideas that maybe started with pure and good intentions have been twisted into something that has us forget our connection to God, to nature, to family, and to what's really important. That's the foundation of the book, is request for us to move back into that world.

[01:32:34.000] - Speaker 2
Just to be clear, would you say that over the main years of your life and your family's life, you would be maybe in the 1% most extreme liberal people on the planet?

[01:32:49.420] - Speaker 1
No. Here's the thing. My dad voted Reagan, Reagan, Bush, Perot, I want to say, because he owned a business. My father's very conservative But I think socially, my father was very liberal, and my dad doesn't have a lot of judgment about people's personal choices in life. But he was always fiscally conservative and very socially open, if that makes sense. That's the environment I grew up in. My mother didn't really vote. She would just say stuff like, Being the president is a hard job, and we should all trust him. We should all respect him. But now my mother's deep down the rabbit hole sends me Max Egan's Crow house every single week. My father moved to Idaho. We're all in different places than we were. But yes, we probably could have looked up in Wikipedia, what is a liberal woman in Los Los Angeles, and a vegan chef, high bread, married to an undocumented man. I was that person. I went to the alternative community school in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca was the first town to outlaw gas stoves. I mean, there's no logic there. We're just going to burn coal and then use electricity because that's somehow more efficient.

[01:34:07.840] - Speaker 1
I think it's not. But anyways, that's Ithaca. I grew up in the liberal of the liberal. I went to the liberal of the liberal school. Literally, we had a graffiti room. If you needed to express your feelings via graffiti, there was a space for that. There was an all-school meeting every day so people could raise their hand and express whatever is going on for them. I The People's History of Howard Zinn was our history book. I grew up in a very liberal household. Even though my dad voted for his businesses, he voted Republican, mostly.

[01:34:41.040] - Speaker 2
Tell me about government subsidies for farmers. What about it works? What about it doesn't work?

[01:34:47.840] - Speaker 1
Government subsidies for farmers, again, something that started with really good intentions. Now has people stuck in a system where they're growing food that they know is never going to come to fruition. There's areas in Mississippi that are flooding and flooding over every year, and they still have to put plants in the ground and then apply for crop insurance because it's the only way to survive. There's all of these subsidies for corn and soy, and there's very little motivation to have subsidies for farming that would shift the way our food system is built. But I do believe I believe right now we're in a special moment in America of a coalition. If the left can just remember that healthy food is important to them, and I know it is because I've been in the healthy food space my whole life, and I'm clear that it's important to the left, but it seems like right now they're acting like it's not important to them. But if we could have this coalition of both sides saying this is important, this could be a moment where we could be the soft landing for farmers to make the transition. If If Molly was queen for a day, Molly was a bureaucrat with a pen for a day, the first thing I would do, which is very, very, very controversial, I would make Snap benefits only apply to Whole Foods and foods that had less than eight ingredients.

[01:36:15.040] - Speaker 1
Now, people will say, That's crazy. There's food deserts. I would also say that every state should adopt. There's about 10 states that have the double dollars at the farmer's market. When you spend your Snap benefits at the farmer's market, you get two for one dollars. Now, what I believe would happen if we made this change in the Snap program, the subsidies for soda companies, which are 20% of $119 billion, 20% of that, if we When we did this, food deserts would start to disappear. Farmers markets will pop up in all these neighborhoods, and the local bodega or the corner store in the tiny town is going to start to have more single-ingredient foods, more nutrient-dense foods, because Because these small town convenience stores largely depend on Snap benefits. These corner stores in the hood largely depend on these Snap benefits. The system would shift if we made this check, and I believe it should go back to farmers. There should be an incentive to spend it direct to farmers. I am not 100% anti-subsidies. I think we need more carrot and less stick. I think that we need to have There are policies that are more rounded, not just solving for one single problem.

[01:37:35.240] - Speaker 2
On the points where if Mollet had the pen for a day, who are the people who have the pen now who could make those changes? Do you know?

[01:37:43.300] - Speaker 1
I think that Trump could Do an executive order and change what's available in Snap. But the Snap is in the farm bill. So ultimately, the farm bill needs to be shifted. They didn't even pass a farm bill this last time. It got put off into the future. Congress, they're just so inept. They are supposed to be the purse. They never hold the purse strings. Right now in committee in both Congress and in the Senate, there is a bill called the Prime Act. It was brought from Massey, and I believe that Ron Paul has introduced it in the Senate. It's in committee in both houses, not stagnant, not moving. This would allow farmers to process on farm or at local, what's called an inspected facility or a custom facility where it's inspected by the Health Department of the state, but it's not USDA inspected. Because of that, we have a lot of times where we There isn't a facility nearby. We are lucky that we do have one. There's always these locally inspected facilities that people are bringing their deer to, their steer, their 4-H thing. We want to make it, and what What Massey is trying to do is that if you have it harvested there, then you could sell it within your state, and so you could sell it to your neighbors.

[01:39:07.040] - Speaker 1
It would incentivize farmers to be able to do custom slaughter and then sell it to their neighbors. Then also the federal rules around chickens are 20,000. You can harvest, I think, 20,000 chickens a year on your property without having to go through the federal chains. But then the states have reduced that to zero or Texas is If we could roll back the states to let people process chickens and meat rabbits locally. The problem is the pen is in a lot of different places. It's on the state level, it's at the federal level, it's in the Congress. But I do think that Trump could likely do a executive order that would shift Snap. Then the states can look at what these other states are doing. Iowa just passed a waiver, so you will not be able to buy. I think Iowa is the best one or the bravest one, I would say. You won't be able to buy anything that has sales tax on it in Iowa with food stamps or Snap or EBT. That takes out candy, soda, power drinks or energy drinks, donuts, chips. Anything that they deem as junk food that is not essential has a tax on it in Iowa.

[01:40:24.800] - Speaker 1
They've said anything that's taxed is not in the program. I would say, if I was Molly, queen of the bureaucrats for a day, I would go further. But I would say Iowa is going to be the test grounded that other states could follow that. Then California, Massachusetts, New York, Colorado are doing the double dollars at the farmer's market. I think states could implement that. What that happened in Los Angeles is all of a sudden, there's South Central has a farmer's market. All of a sudden, the East Side has a bunch of farmers markets. My restaurant was in Echo and largely a Latino neighborhood. You will see people lining up to change in their EBT for Farmer's Bucks so they could get double the produce at the Farmer's Market. That program, I think, supports farmers and supports the health of the community. Then I would be remiss to not mention what's happening in Oklahoma. Aaron Martin has passed the Food is Medicine Act. It's the first state to say that you can use your insurance. Your doctor can write you a prescription. If you have a metabolic condition or a terminal condition, your doctor can write you a prescription for a local and organic food, and your insurance will pay for it.

[01:41:39.480] - Speaker 1
The insurance companies are actually totally on board because Aaron Martin did a test in advance of it with a couple of insurance companies, and the outcomes were unbelievable.

[01:41:51.240] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your brother's work.

[01:41:53.660] - Speaker 1
My brother is the founder of an organization called Kiss the Ground. He made a film called Kiss the Ground that came out on Netflix and now is on Amazon Prime. The sequel is now out called Common Ground. There's a third one coming out called Ground Swell that is looking at the global regenerative movement, not just the American regenerative movement. He started this nonprofit that started in his garage in Venice. That became a large nonprofit. As nonprofits do, they get riddle. He left recently because he took a leave from the nonprofit to support RFK, which was approved by the board. When RFK joined Trump, there was Essentially, people that are in the very liberal mindset just couldn't be okay with that. He has a really great relationship with them. He still works with them, but his politics have shifted to somewhere that they are not. I think that, again, totally well-meaning. I got asked to leave the board for the same reason for my views. Well, I got asked to sign a paper that would say I would never talk about vaccines, abortion, transgender, or anything else that would be politically divisive. I said, I've been on hundreds of podcasts.

[01:43:19.940] - Speaker 1
There's no way I can put that back in the can. I was asked to step down as well. I think that they're just protecting themselves. You know what I mean? It's just It's, again, something gets big and then there's something to protect. I think they're doing extraordinary work in the world, and they are spreading the message of soil. He gave his all to it and his enthusiasm, and he brought it from nothing into something extraordinary. Now he's created 501(C)(4), which is a lobbying organization called American Regeneration that is specifically working towards soil health being at the center of of both political parties, that there's going to be swings back and forth, and how do we have soil health be at the center of the conversation moving forward. He's working with Rick Clark, who's an extraordinary regenerative farmer, has 7,000 acres in regenerative organic, and Kelly Ryerson, who's been a people lobbyist, essentially just lobbying on the behalf of the people to get her name as glycophate girl on her social media. She's just been lobbying against chemical companies on the behalf off of the people as an individual for a long time now. So the three of them started American Regeneration, and they're working alongside of Kiss the Ground.

[01:44:38.700] - Speaker 1
My brother is still promoting the films, and he's launching the educational cut right now of Common Ground, and he's taking that across the country. If anybody has any educational institutions that they want to bring Common Ground into, he has multiple cuts of the film to try to get the message out as much as possible.

[01:44:58.860] - Speaker 2
What's the best way to find out about local farmers? If you want to get food from local farmers and support local farmers, how do you do that?

[01:45:08.060] - Speaker 1
There's so many maps that different people have online, and regenerate America, the regenissance, and multiple other ones. My friend AJ Richards has started a company called From the Farm, and his buy line is shake the hand that feeds you. And he is trying to make a pathway for farmers. I'm great at making social doing things and getting on podcasts and doing all this stuff. But not every farmer has that in them to sell their meat boxes. So he's creating this amazing platform where he's helping you get the boxes and helping you get the dry ice and the cooler, helping you set up your store, taking the photos. And then he's doing advertising on angel studios and different places are advertising from the farm. And then we, as the farmers, are getting lower prices on our shipping because it's It's like we're all one group from the farm. And so there's a benefit in the buying the boxes and the thermoses and all that stuff that needs to send me. And so AJ is doing this great work of trying to move the needle. From the Farm is a great place to look it up and see what's around you and what's near you.

[01:46:21.780] - Speaker 1
I think if you also just go to your local farmer's market and I think have conversations with people. If they're doing the right thing, they're going to be super inspired to tell you about it. People always say, What else could I do, Molly, besides supporting local farms to support the movement? I assert there's nothing more important that you could do. At the rate that we are losing farms, I want you to see it as an imperative to be the best sell in the body that is this earth. You have to support local farmers. We are in an agrarian collapse. If the consumer, the individual, doesn't wake up from their lulled comfort, they're going to find themselves eating some slap, looking into some weird AI goggles and be completely disconnected. It is imperative that the farm survives. You, the consumer, have the power of the purse.

[01:47:21.680] - Speaker 2
Tell me what it feels like to eat food that you've grown yourself versus something that you buy in a store.

[01:47:28.440] - Speaker 1
It's like so much pride. Also, and this is crazy because why is this? But way less willingness to waste it. And I don't know why this is, but now I'm very much less willing to waste store-bought food. But I remember growing food for the first and second time as an adult, and just all of a sudden realizing the value of every tomato, the effort that went into every piece of creation of food. And so there's There's just no other level of pride. There's a spark of recognition of participating in this world in the way we were meant to do it that feels right. I feel the same way when I look out on cows on pasture or sheep on pasture, there's something, there's that crunching sound of the grass and them eating and sitting, laying in the sun and chewing their cud. There's a joy in my body that says, That is what's meant to be happening. That joy and pride, I just feel it in all of me. It's the same for a tomato or a butternut squash or a zikini. I'm so motivated to, Okay, I'm going to make I'm going to make Zucini croquets.

[01:48:45.840] - Speaker 1
I'm going to make Zucini bread. We have all this Zucini. How can I use it? I have pumpkin hot sauce. We're almost out of the pumpkin hot sauce from last year. People are like, Are you making pumpkin hot sauce again this year? Yes, we have tons of pumpkin. I'll be happy to make pumpkin hot sauce. I'm just inspired as a chef to do more than just throw the pump after Halloween. We have a high-risk festival. There's all these pumpkin that we grew. The old Molly, before I grew the pumpkin, just let them rot or then throw them in the compost. That's fine. There's no waste in the compost. But there's something beautiful about... We had this huge pumpkin last year, and I made 12 cases of hot sauce and 17 quarts of pumpkin soup Out of just this one. I made pumpkin queso, which I highly recommend when pumpkin season comes. But it's interesting because we've been struggling in some ways financially since we moved here and getting this project to come off the ground. I was struggling I was dressed out earlier in the year and I was all this money stuff thinking about different things.

[01:49:51.160] - Speaker 1
I went into the restaurant and I was canning food that we grew. Then I was thinking, I'm just wasting my time canning food, avoiding what I need to do. Then I had I just thought, how crazy. A hundred years ago, there was nothing for me to do but can the food that we grew. Now I'm canning this food, but then I'm thinking I need to make money some way over here to pay the bank. That's how the money slave system works is it gets you in this cog in a wheel where you just have to keep doing something that's literally not necessarily even benefiting your life. Saving food for my family, that's what I need to be doing. But somehow I was making myself wrong for that because I wasn't making money. You know what I mean? I think that eating food that you grew has you have so many realizations. I couldn't even tell you all of them. Hundreds of realizations come from the awakeness of eating food that you grew.

[01:50:44.840] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the nutrient density of foods.

[01:50:48.760] - Speaker 1
Plants don't know how to make minerals. I don't know if you notice, they don't make minerals. They only take minerals from the soil. There is no soil on the planet that doesn't have enough nutrients or minerals to grow food. There's only soil that's dead to dead, not enough beings alive in that soil to make the nutrients, the minerals available to the plants. When you have soil that is alive, it has so much more nutrients, so much more minerals. When we think about food, often we're just thinking about the macros. But when we're eating food that was grown in healthy soil with this teeming life, a teaspoon of soil that's healthy has more beings in it than all of the human beings on the planet. There's so much life in this soil, and the design is so perfect. So the sun and the air and the water are up here, and then the plant is drawing all that down, taking the carbon out of the atmosphere, and they're feeding carbohydrates to that microbiology. That microbiology eats the carbohydrates or eats decomposing matter and excretes food for the plants, which has all of the minerals that are in the soil becoming bioavailable for the plant.

[01:52:17.200] - Speaker 1
This is a perfect design. We often think about high tech being a solar panel and low tech being your garden. But your garden is so much more high tech than a solar panel. There's no waste, there's There's no garbage, there's no enslaved children on the supply chain. It is high tech. What it is making is high tech, high nutrients, high God, high vibration food for you to eat. There's literally light inside the food. There's a guy, Eric Cutter, who grows vegetables. He made a film called Pharmacy of Light. He's basically showing that the healthier the food, there's more light in the food. We're all made of sunlight. The food that comes from a healthier system system has more vitality in every way. Then even food that comes from a healthier system loses nutrient density over time. It's dying. As it is dying, it's letting that stuff go. So the faster we can eat the food from the farm, the better, and the more local we can eat the food, the better, and then the healthier the soil, the more nutrient density. There's citrus farmers right now showing multiple times more vitamin C in their citrus than there is in the citrus of their neighbor, growing the exact same genetics across the street.

[01:53:38.160] - Speaker 1
It's all about the microbiology making the nutrients available to the plant. We largely treat our soil like a hydropodic grow, where we're just putting nutrients on it and thinking that the plant can then just take up those nutrients. But that is missing the whole symbiosis of the soil. And the microbiology and breaking down those minerals to go into the plant. Then we're all totally deficient of nutrients. Then we eat too much because our body is still craving something it's not getting.

[01:54:15.620] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the difference between living in California and living in Texas.

[01:54:21.180] - Speaker 1
People are not as interested in healthy food here, would be my first thing that I noticed. I actually just didn't think grownups I lived in LA. I mean, maybe occasionally, you have a Mexican Coke or whatever. But I didn't see a lot of grownups drinking soda all the time. So I was surprised at the grownup consumption of big gulps and 44-ounce sodas. But I've also been moved by people's faith. I owned restaurants in LA for 15 years. Maybe one person ever asked me to pray with them. I would say most days my restaurant is open. Someone is asking to pray with me, telling me they're praying for me, telling me that God told them that this is a food ministry, that this is bigger. Hold on. They got a download from God. He wants me to hold on. I'm in the right place. You keep doing what you're doing. I heard that. People coming up to me just grabbing my hands and saying, Pray with me. I never had that in Los Angeles. People really lead with their faith here, which is nice and different. Also, we do baby showers on the ranch, and I never thought about this as an idea, but in Los Angeles, if someone's daughter gets pregnant at 18 years old, it's an emergency.

[01:55:39.160] - Speaker 1
It's a disaster. It's something to solve for. And here it's a blessing. I'm seeing these young mothers being extraordinary mothers, buying organic flour and making sourdough bread. I have a friend, she's pregnant with her fifth kid and she's 23. She makes all their food from scratch. She orders everything from Azure Standard, she has a garden. Her and her husband built their own house on their parents' property. I have another person that just did their baby shower here. She just had her first baby at 19 years old. They're living in an apartment above the barn on their parents' property. So much support. She had a home birth. She's doing all organic. These are conscious, awake young ladies having babies, and it's being celebrated by the community. I never saw that in the 20-something years I lived in LA. It was something to hide or be ashamed of or try to talk your daughter out of when she got pregnant that young. And I was shocked by this when the first person that was 18-year-old was like, Oh, my daughter's pregnant. I was like, Oh, and they were like, We want to have the baby shower here.

[01:56:47.600] - Speaker 1
I was like, Wow, I don't remember the last time in Los Angeles, I did a baby shower for an 18-year-old. And people might tell me I'm wrong, and they totally celebrated their daughters. But I would say as As a whole, it was not celebrated. I had friends that had their kids get pregnant at that time, and it was either terminated or something to be ashamed of or managed for. And that is not what it's like here at all. And so that was very, very different.

[01:57:20.060] - Speaker 2
What are some of the things you've noticed health-wise since going from vegan to eating some animal foods now?

[01:57:26.800] - Speaker 1
I'm thinner. I lost 40 pounds. I did a raw milk fast for 46 days for lent, and I did only raw milk and raw yogurt. I had this download that as I was getting into my mid-late 40s, I was having this middle section that wasn't going away. And I was trying to help a friend that was having trouble after getting vaccinated. And I was learning about the Bifida bacteria being wiped out in everybody that got the COVID jabs. And then I started learning about Bifida bacteria and how amazing it was and who had the most of it. It's breastfeeding babies. I had this thought, maybe I've killed off a lot of my Bifida and I want to reset my gut like a baby. A baby eats only milk for this extended period of time and then integrate small amounts of food and dirt and the floor and everything else to reset their microbiome. I tried to recreate that for myself. I lost a significant I'm not thinking about a weight. I reset my microbiology. I lost that whole center section of my gut. First thing in the morning when I would just wake up, I would feel a little stiffness in my feet and my hands.

[01:58:44.080] - Speaker 1
By the time I got up and went pee and breastfed the baby, it would go away. But I didn't notice it. Now I'm not having that stiffness unless I did something where I overextended myself physically the day before. I'm not really having any stiffness, and a lot of my brain flog has lifted. And so I attribute that to not just integrating that stuff, but also resetting my microbiology, having my hands in the soil all the time. Because breast milk, which is 90 something % the same DNA as cow's milk, sets the foundation. It's the planned community for the microbiology to move into. And so by resetting and doing only milk for that long, I reset that space for the colonies to grow into, hopefully, or expand that we're already in there. And so I've seen really extraordinary results with that. And I love bone broth. I can feel when I drink the bone broth, I can feel a subconscious, yes, more of that more of that, please. And so I get that my body is asking for it. But I think there's something in nourishing this body that's given so much to make four children this late in life and breastfeed four children this late in life.
