[00:00:08.650] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammatin. Tetragrammat. Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:24.810] - Speaker 2
Was born at Stanford Hospital, and I was raised in Palo Alto, and then I was a postdoc at Stanford from 2005 to 2010. A postdoc is after your PhD. It's more or less like a residency in medicine.

[00:00:43.030] - Speaker 1
And what was your PhD, Aidan?

[00:00:44.560] - Speaker 2
Neuroscience. And then I was a professor at UC San Diego for five years, and then I was recruited back to Stanford in 2016, and I'm still tenured faculty member at Stanford now.

[00:01:00.610] - Speaker 1
Are you young to be tenured?

[00:01:02.440] - Speaker 2
I was tenured at 40. So that's young for reasons that we could get into. Tell me.

[00:01:09.100] - Speaker 1
I don't know anything about that. I don't really even know what tenured is. So tenure, I know it's something you want.

[00:01:16.890] - Speaker 2
Right? A lot of people mistakenly think that tenure means a job for life. That is not true. People can lose tenure for scientific fraud, for doing egregious things that they shouldn't do. But technically, tenure is about academic freedom. So technically so when you get hired as a professor, you are what's called assistant professor, and the name is a misnomer because you're not an assistant to anybody. Just means that you don't have tenure yet. And then typically, depending on the place, it's five to eight years in which you produce original research, and then you go up for tenure. You are evaluated for tenure. And it's a process of internal review. And usually at a place like Stanford, there are going to be 20 outside letters of recommendation will be solicited from experts in your field, and they'll evaluate you compared to others in your field. And then you either get tenure or you don't get tenure. And at the point where somebody gets tenure, they have academic freedom. They can pivot and start working on something completely different if they like. Whereas prior to tenure, you're expected to do more or less what you said you were going to do and do.

[00:02:32.930] - Speaker 1
You say what you're going to do before you come in? How does it work? How does that get decided?

[00:02:36.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So if we back up to the education leading to that, it'll make a little bit more sense. So, in college, I studied biology and psychology. There was no formal field of neuroscience at that time, so I went to college from 93 to 98. I was a five year undergrad because I took a little vacation that we can talk about. My first year was a total flop. The next four years were strong. Then I got a master's in Behavioral Neuroscience, then my PhD in neuroscience. Then I did my postdoc for five years. So I had about 20 years of formal training before I was an assistant professor. When you get hired as an assistant professor, the process is you put out applications to various schools that happen to be hiring for a neuroscience faculty position, and you propose what your lab will do. The simplest way to describe it is you come up with a set of ideas about what your lab will be about, and it has to be unique from what other labs are about. So the Huberman lab I proposed in my application would focus on particular aspects of nervous system development, nervous system regeneration, nervous system function.

[00:03:51.690] - Speaker 2
And what you're really selling when you go on the faculty job market is your unique vision of what your lab is going to be. And it's very different than any other kind of job process or prior portion of the science education, because what you're telling them is that you have a vision of what you're going to do that's distinct from other people. It's a little bit like a startup company, like you're pitching your startup, and then when you get the faculty position, it's that my advisor at the time, right when I got the job, I had several jobs to pick from. It was either go to UC San Diego or MIT. And by the way, when I decided to go to UC San Diego, which is an excellent neuroscience program, the person in charge at MIT looked me in the eye and said, you're crazy if you go to San Diego and not I said, Why? You know, San Diego is a great program. And they said, yeah, but it's not MIT. Four years later, I'm sitting in my office at UC San Diego, and that same person was applying for a job at UC San Diego.

[00:04:57.860] - Speaker 1
Unbelievable.

[00:04:58.630] - Speaker 2
And actually, she wasn't on my schedule, but I requested that she be on my schedule.

[00:05:02.490] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:05:02.820] - Speaker 2
And I said, do you remember you telling me that I was crazy for picking UC San Diego over MIT? And she said, I do. And I said, Why did you say that? She said, My job was to recruit you. And I learned something really important in that moment, which is that the person recruiting or the person trying to convince you of something will say almost anything.

[00:05:24.790] - Speaker 1
They're not necessarily on your side.

[00:05:26.980] - Speaker 2
They are not on your side because and this gets into the intricacies of.

[00:05:30.570] - Speaker 1
Acting, you would think I mean, naively, I would think if the person's trying to get me to come there, it's because they're on my side, too, like, we're in this together.

[00:05:39.260] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:39.690] - Speaker 1
It's not that.

[00:05:40.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Well, and I'm happy to say this, the Boston academic system is notoriously mean. Stanford's a, you know, a plus plus institution, as is MIT, as is Harvard, but the ethos is a little bit different on the east. And, you know, Stanford, by virtue of being in Silicon Valley and Silicon Valley, having so many very young leaders, is very attuned to the future and what's next. The East Coast academic institutions are as well, but they're a little more steeped in know. For instance, I had the experience of being at Stanford when my downstairs neighbor, Roger Kornberg, won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the structure of RNA. His father, Arthur kornberg discovered know, he's got a brother who's a scientist too, and I think another one who's a composer. So this family is interesting in its own right. I remember being so excited, like, Stanford got a Nobel, and it's my downstairs neighbor, and I like Roger a lot, and I worked next door to his lab, and we had some funny interactions with him that were amusing because he's just quirky and brilliant, as so many scientists are. But the point was that I remember telling an undergraduate that was working for me at the time, hey, the guy next door won a Nobel Prize.

[00:07:00.090] - Speaker 2
And you know what his reaction was? Does he have an app which I think just beautifully captures the West Coast phenomenon of it's all about what are you going to do with it? People want to know, what are you going to do with that? Whereas on the East Coast, it's a bit different. They're very attuned to technology and companies. But I think the reason why you don't have a true replica of Silicon Valley in Boston or even in New York or even in Austin for that matter, where now there are incredible companies have moved to Austin and are spawned in Austin is that there's something about the west that even in this modern time of highly interconnected people by way of the Internet, there's something about the west representing the future and not steeped in its past. So you would be hard pressed to find the list of Nobel Prize winners on the wall of Stanford School of Medicine, and yet we have, I believe, nine or more of them, and I know where that set of plaques sits, but most people don't. And Stanford isn't walking around talking about it. Why? Because they're interested in what's happening next.

[00:08:13.280] - Speaker 2
So eventually, the opportunity to move to Stanford was one that I certainly wasn't going to pass up for a lot of reasons. But anyway, going back to the hiring process, I learned during the hiring process, know, once they make you an offer, they can't make an offer to anyone else. And if they don't fill that offer, it's embarrassing for them. And so what she was doing was she was trying to make sure that she didn't have to go back to the dean and say, we failed to recruit this guy, and he went to this other place.

[00:08:37.830] - Speaker 1
And why did you make the choice?

[00:08:40.870] - Speaker 2
It was all gut. In fact, I had an experience from in 2005 where I made the decision to go to Harvard to be a postdoc, and I was going to work for this guy whose research interests were very aligned with what I wanted to do. And I moved there. I didn't start yet, but I was attending his lab meetings, and I was in his office one evening, and the janitor came in, and the janitor had a bit of a stutter, and he came in and he asked if he could get the trash. And this guy whose name I won't name, responded to him in a way that I personally thought was disparaging. I thought it was rude. And the guy asked again, and the way he responded a second time, I felt was disparaging. And in that moment I was like, oh, shit, I can't work for this guy. I don't know how I'm going to leave, but I got to leave. Just the way he treated him. And I think this makes sense to you. Coming up in the punk rock thing, I always fit in pretty well. I had friends, I got along.

[00:09:49.120] - Speaker 2
But I've got this thing about people who are unkind to other people with no cause. I mean, this janitor was being so kind and just doing he was just trying to do his job, and there was absolutely no need for that. It was like in football, unnecessary roughness. Like, that card should have gone up twice. And I remember calling my sister that night, I'm like, oh, shit, I'm screwed. I got to leave here. I don't know how I'm going to do. I don't know what to do. So what ended up happening was I ended up leaving. I didn't tell him why. I didn't feel safe to tell him why. Unfortunately, he hadn't paid me yet. So I came back and I worked for a guy named Ben Barris, who's dead now. All three of my advisors are dead for different reasons. As one of them pointed out, I'm the common denominator, but let's just separate correlation and causation. I was at Stanford from 2005 to 2010 as a postdoc. Last place I ever wanted to be because I grew up there, had a lot of developmental history there that it was a really uncomfortable thing for me to be back in the Bay Area.

[00:10:51.730] - Speaker 2
I was super unhappy. I had a bout of major depression.

[00:10:54.870] - Speaker 1
Yet when you had the chance to go to the East Coast to MIT, you chose to stay on the West Coast, right?

[00:10:59.410] - Speaker 2
So what happened was after that postdoc, working for Ben, who was an amazing person, and we could talk about him for hours, but was an amazing person. I remember looking at my job options and I had a bunch of them, but it boiled down to MIT versus UC San Diego. There was a Texas offer as well at Baylor that financially was really strong, but I didn't want to be down there. Also, for personal reasons, I like Texas a lot. And I went to Ben and I said, what do I do? And now Ben had gone to MIT and his experience there was not a good one. But he said, Listen, I'm going to separate that out. But as your advisor, he said, you're a West Coast kid. You grew up in Palo Alto and the South Bay, san Francisco skateboarding at the time, while I was a postdoc, I was writing for Thrasher. I wrote a music column for thrasher covered bands under a different name. I think you can find these on the Internet. Some of them are a little irreverent, but anyway, they're out there. But I did it for extra cash. And I also like going to shows.

[00:11:59.900] - Speaker 2
And he know, you do this music thing, you're into the skateboarding thing. You grew up here. I think if you go to the East Coast, you're going to hate it. And you already had that one bad interaction with the guy at Harvard. Just go to San Diego. It's a great place and enjoy it. So I went to San Diego, and to be honest, I liked that. The weather was good. I had very few friends there. I was extremely isolated. I had my bulldog that I raised there. My lab thrived there, but it was not a place I wanted to stay. And I knew that from day one. And that went back to when I was a young teenager. When I was 14, I went to a trade show, a skateboarding action sports trade show, because I was really in the skateboard community. I probably skipped school to go to that. Can't imagine I would have gotten permission to go. And I had only bad experiences in San Diego. I got into a physical altercation with a cab driver. We had a bunch of stuff stolen from us. I was getting into a lot of trouble back then.

[00:13:01.070] - Speaker 2
So there's this phenomenon in neuroscience called conditioned place preference, where if something good happens to you someplace, you just feel good when you're there. And then there's also conditioned place aversion and Animals show. It give an animal shock in one corner of a cage, it won't go back to that corner. Duh. So I had like a conditioned place avoidance or aversion to San Diego, but I had my lab there. And then when the job opportunity came up at Stanford, I applied. I was like, both hands up, and I took it. But even then, I thought about going to NYU, because I've always wanted to live in New York. I love New York City. I went there when I was five years old with my family, and I remember thinking, this is the most incredible place in the world. It's the most incredible place. And this is when Times Square was seedy. I was born in 75, so this would be 1980. It was grimy, but I remember thinking, I can't believe it exists. And to me, I've done a little bit of snorkeling and scuba diving. I think of New York City as a tropical reef.

[00:14:02.920] - Speaker 2
Everywhere you look, there's life. Look down an alley, there's life. Look over there. Go downstairs, there's life. Whereas to me, the West Coast always seemed a bit more sparse. The life exists on a different scale. If you go scuba diving or snorkeling in the Monterey Bay, which I have, it's all just big kelp beds. And every once in a while, big fish goes by. So there was always a bit of a depressive tone for me in beautiful places like Big Sur, Monterey Bay. They did not feel warming to me. But I remember, and I've always been obsessed with the carawak thing and all these East Coast academics and creatives you're a good example of this who come from the East Coast, get to the West Coast, and they just, like, bask in it. They're like, Whoa, this is amazing. But I grew up on the West Coast, so it's always had this kind of mix for me of feeling like home, but never quite right. And then the east coast. Love visiting New York City, but not quite right. So in 2015, I was exploring NYU versus Stanford, and I loved the lab they were going to give me at NYU.

[00:15:09.820] - Speaker 2
It's right off Washington Square. It had, like, exposed beams. The architecture was beautiful. And I thought, well, where am I going to live? There was a little place on Eldridge Street that I fell in love with that I couldn't afford, but I'm like, somehow I'm going to live there. And my girlfriend at the time, she had lived in New York, loved New York. We were just like new York, New York, New York. The whole, we're going, we're moving, we're getting out of San Diego, because I'd met her in San Diego, and then I was back in San Diego. I had to make the decision. And I was doing work on the speed bag. I'd started boxing in San Diego. That's how deprived I felt, that I literally was sparring every Wednesday night, getting hit because I'd fought when I was younger, some Thai boxing. So now I'm sparring again. Totally unnecessary. I just don't recommend it. You're getting hit in the head. I'm not making money, and I'm working on the speed bag. And I'm going into this, what I call wordlessness, where I'm trying to not think, just get into listening and rhythm. I do this when I run sometimes, and out of nowhere, boom.

[00:16:11.670] - Speaker 2
I don't want to go to an NYU. Why? They expect me to work on primates. I had done a little bit of primate work. I'm an animal lover. We could talk about the primate work and why I'd gotten into it, but I was like, you know what? I don't want to work on primates, and that's what they want me to do. And I don't want to work on mice. In fact, I don't want to work on animals at all. Now, I'm a meat eater. I'm omnivore, but I eat meat. I try and get ethically know meat and that kind of thing, but I just think, like, I don't want to do it. I see myself in New York working on monkeys, marmosets these little monkeys. I don't want to do it anymore. And I don't know how it's going to work out, but I know if I go to Stanford. I can start a lab to work on humans. I can phase out my animal work. And there's something about going to Stanford that even though I don't want to be back in Palo Alto, I have all this conditioned place aversion to that growing up there and I went through a lot there, more than some, less than others.

[00:17:13.450] - Speaker 2
But it was hard place for me to be. If I go back and I go to Stanford, something good will happen. And if I go to NYU, it's just like going down the wrong path. So it was just in a state of wordlessness that it just came and.

[00:17:31.730] - Speaker 1
It came to you all at once and it was clear and you'd never second guessed it after that.

[00:17:37.220] - Speaker 2
Right. It was absolute agony to get to that point. In fact, my then girlfriend will tell you it was agony. She wanted to go to New York, I wanted to go New York. I became the definition of neurotic around this decision. Talking it this way, talking it that way, thinking about this, thinking about that, getting opinions pros and cons like I would have done electric shock therapy to come up with the solution. I was so miserable trying to come up with the right answer. This offers that, but that offers this, but then the apartment in New York and then there's the hierarchy in New York and then the Stanford. Oh my God. I was making myself sick. And frankly, I'm amazed she stuck with me through that because I was becoming incredibly difficult to be around. And everyone was like, no more discussion about this decision. Just make a decision, flip a coin. And in that moment, it just came to me. So I guess the way to put it is that I can agonize over a decision, seek input from anyone who will listen about the issue. But once I see the truth and feel it, there's no going back.

[00:18:47.050] - Speaker 1
And I love that it happened by yourself in a quiet moment. It didn't happen because somebody made a recommendation. Didn't happen that way. First you did all of the research, you had all of these conflicting ideas and then in a quiet moment, it bubbled up.

[00:19:06.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it just geysers out of my clarity.

[00:19:09.220] - Speaker 1
You had clarity, 100% of clarity.

[00:19:11.780] - Speaker 2
It just boom. And the first person I told wasn't my girlfriend because she was really my family at that time. We met shortly after I moved to San Diego. She had a dog, I had a dog. We raised a dog. We were a family of two with the dogs. And it was a hard relationship and I brought a lot of the difficulties to that relationship for sure. But I was isolated in San Diego except for her and the dogs, and I had a few but. So the logical thing would have been to call her and tell her. But I had been working with a coach, not a therapist. I had also been working with a therapist, but I'd been working with a coach. This was a woman who, at the time was the wife of a Seal team guy, lived out on Coronado Island, and I'd been working with her for a few years. Her name was Wendy, and I would go see her, and we would just talk in a completely non therapeutic way. Like, she was licensed to do coaching and this kind of thing, but she was like, it's all about getting into these wordless states.

[00:20:11.730] - Speaker 2
It's all about wordlessness. So maybe you should run, or maybe you should swim, or you should just do something that gets you into these wordless states. So I started the boxing thing, and that brought up a lot for me because one of the reasons why I'm terrible at boxing I mean, I actually fought some fights. I had my boxing license, and I loved the training, and I won some fights. Never got knocked down, never got knocked out. But when I'd hit the other guy, I'd feel kind of bad. I don't want to hurt other people. And I understand that the ritual of boxing. And I'd gotten a lot of fights when I was younger, so I used to have to do this psych up for myself before we'd spar. Or I fought some fights where you're trying to knock the other guy out, and I'd think I would make up these stories that the guy had raped my sister, for instance. And now I'm trying to channel this false aggression. And occasionally you sink one through the guard acting. Yeah. And it feels, for the moment, you're like, got him. You see his head snap back.

[00:21:13.530] - Speaker 2
But then I didn't feel good. I felt like, this is not good. Okay. So she eventually said, Listen, you seem to like the training, that the fighting seems to be drawing up a lot of old narratives and stuff. That doesn't feel good, because when I got in fights when I was younger, I didn't like it either. It came from a place of pain. You know this about anyone? It's rooted in pain. There's a great book, actually, by Sam Sheridan called A Fighter's Heart where he talks about all the different forms of fighting and martial arts. And while I have great reverence for it, and so does Sam, at the end, he talks know, life is about building things up, not about breaking them down. And in cultures like Thailand, where people fight, they think it's insane that people who don't have to fight for a living would choose to fight. So here I am as a you know, I got my assistant professorship when I was 35. I'm almost 40. I'm boxing Wednesday night. I'm sparring. I'm fighting once every three months or so, doing the whole thing. And then I enjoyed that to some extent.

[00:22:16.640] - Speaker 2
I liked the relationship to my coach, loved the training. But I don't want to hurt anybody. So I get really into the training, and in that moment, it just comes out like hitting the speedbag. And I went and called Wendy and I said, I made my decision. And she said, Great. And I said, I'm going to Stanford. And she said, Great. And I said, but what's wild is how I came up with the decision. I was hitting the speedbag, and I got into a rhythm around that, and all of a sudden it was, I don't want to go to NYU and harm monkeys. Boom. And she goes, Love it. To her, it didn't really matter. I could have told her that I had picked up a blue pebble on the beach, and the blue pebble talked to me. I mean, it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever. The point was that it was about getting into a state of wordlessness.

[00:23:02.720] - Speaker 1
It's also interesting that you got there through a physical means, so you were doing something physical that took focus, intention, and a lot of energy.

[00:23:16.110] - Speaker 2
And the speedbag is interesting because if anyone who knows how to speed bag will tell you there are a million different ways to hit the speed bag. You hit it with the side of your hand, but the rhythm of it, you're listening. And some guys will tap their foot while they do it. Some guys pivot their hips. There are a million different ways to do the speed bag, but the harder you hit the speed bag, the less proficient you're going to be. It's about being smooth. It's about staying loose. It's about keeping your elbows know. People tell you it's like milking a cow. It's like doing all sorts of things, but it's a rhythm dance. Yeah. When you see Floyd Mayweather looking at the camera while he's speedbacking, it's all through the ears. Now, I'm not a very auditory driven person. I'm hyper visual, and I study the visual system. But with the speed bag, I learned how to connect my bodily rhythms to auditory rhythms in the way that probably a drummer does in some ways. And I think it just tapped into a different part of my nervous system. And even as I'm sitting here now making the motion, I can feel it in my legs, because proper speed bagging comes from the floor up.

[00:24:24.360] - Speaker 2
It's not just about the hands you're trying to pull from the floor when you punch this kind of thing. And there it was. It hit me. And I've had the same experience while running. I like to run for me an hour or an hour and a half at least once a week. And those runs are as much about clearing out the clutter as they are about exercise as it is about just seeing what geysers up. And as a neuroscientist, I have theories about this, that we're trying to shut down a certain amount of our predictive brain. A big part of our brain is dedicated to trying to anticipate what's going to happen next. And that part of our brain is remarkable, and it is what allows us to strategize. But it is also a problem because that very same part of the brain, it is responsible for the sh to the rest of your brain, which is the deeper recesses of the brain, the subconscious and your limbic system. And not just the limbic system, but other systems. So what you do, I believe, when you run or you get into some sort of rhythmic repeated movement, is you get into a state of wordlessness.

[00:25:40.490] - Speaker 2
The narratives become fractured, and then they start to disappear. And then subconscious ideas and narratives start to geyser up. And some people get this while swimming, some people get it while running. I happen to get it while speed bagging or while running. I've tried to get it in meditation, but I haven't managed to do that. I think we can reach our subconscious through sleep and dreaming. That's not an original idea. Jung talked about this. I think this has been known for thousands of years. Young just articulated it. I've just been listening to man and his symbols again, and the book starts talking about that. But the decision of whether or not to go to NYU or Stanford is probably one of the most important decisions of my entire career and life. And it was clearly the right one for me. And not just because Stanford's an amazing university, but also because of what happened after I got back and it came through a state of physical action and wordlessness.

[00:26:39.940] - Speaker 1
You think it could happen through a breathing technique. You said you've never got there through meditation, but I'm wondering if meditation isn't a physical enough act.

[00:26:49.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's a great question. So in 2015, I heard about this guy wim HOF. I got a plane ticket, went to Spain. I'd contacted him and his family before I met him in the Pyrenees and did some mountaineering with Wim, some wild stuff that was a little too wild, meaning it almost got me killed at one point. Almost got my leg ripped off. I came back with a pretty major injury jumping off a bridge backwards. Wim and I did a sling off a suspension bridge that we rigged up, and I had the rope between my legs, and it cut down to the tendons on one side. And then I was lowered into the water afterwards, and something got in there and it got a bad infection. It was pretty ugly. Shouldn't have done that. But during that trip, I did get the opportunity to do three or four rounds of true vimhof, cyclic hyperventilation type breathing each day with extensive breath holds. Nowadays it's become a little bit more controversial because people have done this near water, in water, and have gotten hurt. When I was there, they were very clear to only do it on land.

[00:28:06.430] - Speaker 2
So we were going hard with the breathing, and I. Did get into some states of altered consciousness. I don't know that I had any ideas there, but I learned a lot about what breath work can do. And then when I returned, I dedicated a good arm of my lab to studying respiration, which we recently published a clinical trial.

[00:28:27.560] - Speaker 1
It's a very psychedelic experience, wim Hop breathing.

[00:28:30.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I think that critics of Wim will say, oh, it's just like tumor breathing or cyclic hyperventilation. Or I get a little amused by the claims that different forms of breathing mimic one another. Or we published this clinical trial comparing cyclic hyperventilation, which looks a lot like Wim HOF breathing, versus cyclic sighing, which looks a little bit more like pranayama breathing. The idea that anyone could be the owner of breathing, it's the most hysterical idea to me, anyway. I certainly don't claim to be. I don't think Wim does either. But I agree. I think that the breath work is powerful, and it did shift my state. But I didn't come to cognitive clarity about something or decision clarity. It taught me how to sense my body more. And as my colleague David Spiegel, who's a world expert in hypnosis clinical hypnosis, says, breathing represents a bridge between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind because it's the one aspect of our physiology that is always operating in the background, but that we can take conscious control over. And when we do that, it shifts our state of mind. You could say that about walking.

[00:29:48.980] - Speaker 2
Like when you walk, you don't think about it, but then you could decide to step with mindfulness. But the shift in your mindset when you do that is not as profound as when you just change your breathing. So the breathing really is a bridge, a powerful, accessible bridge between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind. But to me, this getting into these states of wordlessness on a weekly basis, if not more, is just clear that it's a powerful thing to do.

[00:30:18.520] - Speaker 1
So when you're in these wordless states and an epiphany happens, do you immediately write it down? What's your way of capturing them?

[00:30:26.730] - Speaker 2
Odly and I say oddly, because I'm pretty verbal, and I also write things down all the time. Last night we were watching the documentary about The Clash, and I got my phone out, and I remember thinking, I hope Rick doesn't think I'm not paying attention to the documentary. But I was writing down songs that I had forgotten about, quotes from Strummer, like notes, because it was just such a great documentary. But when I've arrived at decisions or clarity in these wordless states, it shows up like a bold faced word in one shot. There's no way I could forget. I had a dream three weeks ago. I'd been working through some hard stuff, and I had this very complicated dream. At the end of the dream, this word just popped up devotion.

[00:31:15.110] - Speaker 1
You saw the word in writing.

[00:31:16.670] - Speaker 2
I saw the word in writing, devotion, and I went, oh, my God. And I woke up and I called our mutual friend, Paul Conti. I texted him, I have to talk to you about this dream. And we ended up talking about the dream and he said, it's unusual for something to come through so clearly.

[00:31:33.400] - Speaker 1
As I was going to say, I've never seen a word in a dream in my life.

[00:31:38.400] - Speaker 2
Well, I felt devote what devotion. And in this case, it was someone else's devotion to me and then my sense of devotion and how critical devotion is as a concept and a feeling to me, not a concept, but as a feeling. And it was like inescapable at that point. So I could write it down. I certainly don't need to tattoo it on my body. I will never forget the speedbag, experience and what came to me. I will never forget that dream. I will never forget standing on Sands Beach at UC Santa Barbara where I was a student, and praying at that point in my life for some sense of clarity around some extremely hard circumstances and feeling. It hit me, boom. I'll never forget. I'll just never forget that it comes through in like a single word or concept. And I have some experience now with the various psychedelics and plant medicines. I'm not a real psychonaut. I've done some clinical trials, so I've done high dose psilocybin once. I've done MDMA again in a clinical setting four times. Each time there's been at least from MDMA, it's been one concept, one word, which for a guy like me, who's not known for being succinct since I was little, I had my family's half Argentine, so they call that instead of calling it Pacifiers the Chupete.

[00:33:04.150] - Speaker 2
The Chupete was always on the side of my mouth and I could talk with the Chupete in and they said I basically came out talking and never stopped, according to my sister and many people around me. So, for me, wordlessness is such a foreign idea, but it's also where the gems lie, especially when I've got a problem that's like really vexing. I mean, I almost got buried in some of these choices. They're just agonizing like, oh, my God, and I couldn't get myself out of the tangle.

[00:33:37.330] - Speaker 1
Because they're both good choices and depending on which one you pick, you're going to have an entirely different life.

[00:33:42.660] - Speaker 2
Yes, and to me, that was overwhelming.

[00:33:46.090] - Speaker 1
It's reasonable for that to be the case.

[00:33:48.350] - Speaker 2
And I'm not somebody who struggles with decision making, despite what some people close to me might argue. I don't. I love what I love. When I was a kid, I love tropical fish. I could walk into the store and I'm like, that tiger barb. That one? No, that one, that plant. I got really into birds after that and then it was like, of all the birds, it was like that one, it was the gray cheek dwarf parrot. That's the bird, and I can just home right in on it. And I've been that way mostly in my life choices. But when it comes to certain choices where there's a more complex constellation of features like income, location, what your partner wants, what the days are going to be, know opportunities, I think that that NYU Stanford decision was really about trying to portal into the future of where it was all going to lead. Because even though at the time I had no concept of a podcast, I had no concept of doing anything public facing, I had no social media, or if I had it, it was just as a placeholder. I must have known in my subconscious.

[00:34:58.740] - Speaker 2
I must have known I want to become a public science educator. I must have known, and I must have known. How could I don't believe that our brain just learns things as we go forward. I think we have an understanding of where we could end up.

[00:35:15.370] - Speaker 1
How and when did you decide to go into academics as your life?

[00:35:20.790] - Speaker 2
Okay, so I will try and keep this story relatively succinct, but my dad is a theoretical physicist. He was an experimentalist. So he's from Argentina. From Buenos Aires. He came to the US. On a naval scholarship, was a student at UPenn. When he finished his PhD, he had met my mother in New York. They moved to California, and he worked for Xerox Park, which was a think tank ish kind of place down the road from Stanford, up the road from what would eventually become Apple and those companies. And he did that because my dad hated academia. He told me from a young age, it's peasantry. You don't make any money. Everyone tells you that. It's really cool what you do, and your life is hard. You're always trying to raise money. So he went to a company where they would fund his research, and he did stuff related to computer science and some theoretical physics stuff. He was involved in Chaos if the book Chaos by Jim Glick has a chapter about him. My dad was so when we were kids, my mother didn't work at the time. Growing up, she was a housewife, eventually became a teacher.

[00:36:32.280] - Speaker 2
But we would go during the summer to the Aspen Center for Physics. We weren't wealthy. We weren't poor, but we weren't wealthy. But we went there because Murray Gelman, who's a Nobel Prize winner in physics, who was head of the Santa Fe Institute for a long time, decided to hold this physics institute in Aspen. So we go there during the summer. And I was a kid obsessed with birds and fish, fishing and nature, and so I've always liked biology, and I was surrounded by all these greats in physics. I remember meeting Gilman. I went bird watching with Gilman. I remember hearing stories about Richard Feynman. My dad knew Richard Feynman. In fact, recently I gifted a book that richard Feynman had written on physics that he signed for my dad. I gifted to our friend Peter Attia because he's a Feynman collector. So I grew up hearing about physics. We had graduate students to our house. My dad had an association with Stanford, and so he had graduate students and postdocs. And I kind of heard about that stuff, and I knew what a scientist was. And I asked my dad if he liked doing science.

[00:37:31.780] - Speaker 2
And he says, It's like every day is your birthday. And I remember thinking every day he said yeah. And I said, well, what do you do? And he said physics. And I said, well, then I'll do physics. When I was a little kid, we had this conversation. I remember this. I was six. And he said, no, don't do physics. Most of the big questions are already resolved. And I said, well, then, what should I work on? And he said, Work on the brain. I said, oh, I'll work on the brain. So I remember declaring that when I was a kid, six years old, standing at the entryway.

[00:37:59.570] - Speaker 1
So really your dad suggested your path.

[00:38:02.240] - Speaker 2
That's right.

[00:38:02.990] - Speaker 1
That's amazing.

[00:38:03.720] - Speaker 2
He did.

[00:38:04.570] - Speaker 1
And you didn't as punk rock as you are, you didn't rebel against it.

[00:38:08.000] - Speaker 2
Not yet. Yeah, he said, this is the best job, and we don't know much about how the brain works. And I loved the Guinness Book of Worlds records. And I loved the Encyclopedia. And through elementary school, I used to spend weekends reading about medieval weapons or about biology. And on Mondays, I used to come into class and I would ask if I could give a lecture about what I had learned. So I was like a little mini professor, so much so that they had me see a psychologist. They were a little worried. And here's what's also strange. I now know the biological reason for this. My voice was always the way it is now. So I was a little kid with the exact same voice I have now. We have some recordings. They called me Froggy, like the kid from The Little Rascals. And so I was like this little man talking about all these ideas. But I was a little kid. I also had hair on my Adam's apple from the time I was really young.

[00:38:58.720] - Speaker 1
And you wanted to share the information.

[00:39:00.760] - Speaker 2
I couldn't help but share the information. I got obsessed with fish for a little while. My mom told me about these carnivals that she took. Me and my friends, they were giving away goldfish where you'd throw the ping pong ball in. And I realized that all these goldfish were going to die because people didn't know about the dechlorinization process. So I went out and bought a bunch of dechlor. She bought it, and then I would give it away at fairs. If you listened to my lecture about how to take care of fish, that was the price you had to pay.

[00:39:29.350] - Speaker 1
And do you think that you learned the things that you learned because you were purely interested in them for yourself, or you learned the things you learned because you thought, these are the things.

[00:39:38.330] - Speaker 2
I want to teach, always, because I was purely interested in them.

[00:39:41.610] - Speaker 1
So it always starts with your hunger for information?

[00:39:45.040] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. To this day, because the podcast is about researching stuff and then sharing it with the world. It's about finding the gems. Like, I'll never forget seeing tropical fish for the first time and thinking, the saltwater tanks look artificial. That doesn't look like snorkeling. I've gone snorkeling. The freshwater tanks are amazing. They're these little ecosystems. And I could tell that the fish were happy for whatever reason. And then I'd want to learn everything I could about it, and then I couldn't help but tell people about like, I just couldn't. It was like, this is so cool. Like, if anyone hasn't seen Takashi Amano's work, this is a guy who died, unfortunately, of pneumonia about 15 years ago. This Japanese guy developed aquascaping, which is all about the plants, maybe occasionally a fish. When I first saw Takashi Amano aquascaping, I thought I had seen. Okay. Because it was before puberty. This was, like, cooler than sex, because I didn't know what sex really was. I mean, I had a concept from from a young age, but cooler than an amusement park. It was cooler than cartoons. It was like, Holy shit, this is the coolest thing.

[00:40:57.890] - Speaker 2
I need to tell everybody about how cool it is. And so for me, it was always.

[00:41:03.670] - Speaker 1
Like so you were always sharing what.

[00:41:05.740] - Speaker 2
You were enthusiastic about, and to this day, yes.

[00:41:08.650] - Speaker 1
And that's because something turns on in you that's exciting and positive, and you want other people to feel that.

[00:41:15.460] - Speaker 2
My limbs start to float a little bit. This is the sensation in my body. My limbs start to float a little bit, but I'll see something. Like, I'll go on PubMed, and I'll be researching something about whatever topic, sleep and dreaming or something. And then you'll find a reference to a review, and then you go to the review, and there's nothing, and okay, like, this is kind of cool. And then you'll find a book, and you look at that book, and on the third chapter, you see it, and it's like, oh, my God.

[00:41:40.250] - Speaker 1
It.

[00:41:41.000] - Speaker 2
Oh, my God. And research in science is the same way. You're slicing through a brain or you're staining a brain, you're down the microscope, and you see beautiful neurons everywhere, and they're there, and they're stained, and then every once in a while, you see something, oh, my God, this has meaning. And I don't always know what the meaning is, but I know it means something. And so my nervous system from a very young age, was tuned to mostly biology, later psychology, but to somehow certain aspects of biology just dazzle, but not just because they're beautiful like they have meaning. It's communicating something to me, and I want to communicate that to other people. I just want to pass it along. I'm not even sure that I want to. It really is a compulsion now. When I was eight or nine, I had a grunting tick. It shows up still. Now if I get fatigued, I'll start a little bit of a grunting tick. A lot of young boys in particular have these circuits that get activated and have a hard time getting shut down. And it can be a little bit tourette's. Like, some kids will blink hard, some kids have full blown tourette's.

[00:42:48.590] - Speaker 2
I have always felt like physical energy builds up inside me and it needs to be released, and learning and teaching is the most adaptive form of that release. I eventually came to see that I learned that, and I don't recommend doing this, but I used to get rid of that. It's like a motor anxiety that then can be released. I used to shake. I'll just do it right now because I still do it every once in a while in secret. This is on audio, but I'll just shake my head from side to side really fast, like, oh. And it feels like it makes me calm again. But when I see something I'm excited about it's like it's a whole body energy, and it doesn't feel like it needs to be extruded, like it's not something I want to get out of me. In fact, by teaching it, I always learn, and I know this from teaching at Stanford and elsewhere, is that the best teachers have mastery of the material, but they're also presenting the material as a novice. They're looking at it, like, with delight. And I think that's the word that really captures it is delight.

[00:43:48.470] - Speaker 2
Listen, this is exactly the same feeling I experienced know, growing up. I listened to ACDC, Led Zeppelin, I heard some cool music. My sisters listened to Grateful Dead. They were from our hometown on and on, everyone's into like, Def Leopard or whatever it was. And a guy named Jim Thebo, who runs a bunch of skateboard companies now, gave me a tape, cassette tape, and it was stiff little fingers, and I'm probably twelve years old at that point, put that in and flamboyant, and I was just like, oh my God, that's for you. Oh, my God.

[00:44:29.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:44:29.820] - Speaker 2
And I wasn't angry yet. So I think words, spoken language is incredibly varied and quote unquote sophisticated, but I think at a core level, the nervous system has some very fundamental and not terribly varied sets of feelings or states of mind and body. And for me, it's this feeling of discovery, delight, and excitement, like, oh my God, there's more of this. Even if I only listen to that song, like a million times at that moment. What I'm realizing is, now that I know this exists, it's like, it's available. Something's available I can listen to this again, and I can feel this again. And I'm not somebody who attenuates to the things I love. This is one of the reasons why I don't know that much different music. Because I'm so sated by the things I love. So stiff little fingers did it, and then skateboarding did it. Because in my town, everyone played tennis or swam or played soccer, and I did some of that. But then getting back to the science piece is that when I was 13, roughly 14, my parents split. And it was a super high conflict divorce. Listen, I have love and respect for my parents, but it's like they took the list of all the things not to do in a divorce and did all of them repeatedly.

[00:45:58.210] - Speaker 2
And so my dad moved out, my sister was off at college. My mom was really struggling, and I think I was at first depressed, and then I was hitting puberty too. So from really 13 to 19, I basically blew off school and focused entirely on skateboarding.

[00:46:22.190] - Speaker 1
What was your relationship with your dad like?

[00:46:25.050] - Speaker 2
Very complicated. Very high. Very high.

[00:46:27.600] - Speaker 1
Had it been the whole time or had it been only from the time starting then?

[00:46:31.130] - Speaker 2
My dad and I were always close in the sense that we'd talk about things when he'd go the lab at night and I'd go with him, he'd let me take bananas and put them in liquid nitrogen and then throw them against the wall and break them. Like cool stuff that you'd never let kids do now. But I was close with my mom too. I mean, my mom held poetry club for us in the summers. My mom was a real do gooder. So we'd see a homeless person on the street and she would pull over and that person would be in a hotel that night. And we had the people living in our garage that she would take in. She was a real do gooder. She really fell into a spiral when my parents split. My dad would see me once a week, and it was really hard to connect with him because my life sucked at home. It really sucked. It was super dark. I went from having a family to, like, nothing. My mom was in a real spiral.

[00:47:22.200] - Speaker 1
Did you blame him?

[00:47:23.760] - Speaker 2
At first, yes, because he would tell me, this is good for us. I'm like, this sucks. This sucks. I wasn't so upset that they had split as much as everything was falling apart. I remember there wasn't food for dinner. My mom would get food, but then I'd hear her crying all the time. I think her concept of family was that families stick together no matter what. I was just so distraught.

[00:47:49.130] - Speaker 1
Do you know what led to their breakup?

[00:47:53.110] - Speaker 2
They're both older siblings and there was a bit of a power struggle. No, I don't know. I don't think it was any one thing. I think they had very different ideas of how to live life and value. Had they been married 20 years? Yeah. So I think values wise, it was really different. My dad wanted a kind of I think he wanted kids, but I don't know that he wanted young kids, and all that goes with young kids. My mom loved all the family stuff, but it was volatile. I mean, I remember growing up, I'd hear screaming matches, and my dad would try and pacify things, but, yeah, they weren't getting along. And they were pretty good at hiding the dynamics of what was leading to the problems. Like? I don't know. Really. I eventually came to learn that there was some friction that is typical adult friction. But when they said they were getting divorced, I wasn't surprised. I don't even know that I was that upset. But then the way things played out was really life changed in a way.

[00:48:57.310] - Speaker 1
That was not great.

[00:48:58.300] - Speaker 2
The house was dark. Now I have to confess, I mean, I've got two loving parents. They love my sister and I. They're very loving.

[00:49:07.330] - Speaker 1
But both still alive.

[00:49:08.660] - Speaker 2
They're both still alive.

[00:49:09.620] - Speaker 1
Great.

[00:49:09.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Congratulations. Both still alive. My dad's going to turn 80 this year. He's still active as a scientist. My mom is a few years behind him, but it's both remarried, my dad divorced again, reunion pending. We don't know where that's going to go. At that time, my dad and I would meet once a week, and he'd tell me that things were okay. I'm like, Things are pretty fucking far from okay. And my anger towards him was growing. And then the big chasm, really, and he and I have worked this out, but was that I asked to live with him. I'm like, I got to get out of here. So I switched high schools, and I was working at a skateboard shop downtown Palo Alto at that time, and I had a girlfriend on the other side of town, the other high school, so I want to be there, and I was supposed to move in with him. And then we have a differing versions of this, he and I, so I want to be respectful of that. But then he said, I've got a girlfriend, and she's going to live with me. And I said, okay, and met her, and she was cool.

[00:50:12.000] - Speaker 2
Eventually became his wife, but then he said, So you're not. And at that point, it was like putting gasoline on fire. And I was like, Fuck that, as a 14 year old. And I was like, this is not good. So I started really acting out. Stopped going to school, getting into fights. I wasn't doing drugs, wasn't drinking. That wasn't part of the skateboard scene in the late 80s, early 90s. It was late 80s, but I was getting into so much trouble and so truant that eventually I got taken away. I got locked up. So I got called into the office one day.

[00:50:49.310] - Speaker 1
What office?

[00:50:50.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah, at school, I showed up, they're.

[00:50:52.770] - Speaker 1
Like and this is public school?

[00:50:54.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's public school right over the fence from my high school. And they're like, we need to talk to you, school counselor. And there's this guy sitting in the room, and after about ten minutes, I realize I'm like, they're going to take me away. So they took me to a detention center up the peninsula. I had no choice.

[00:51:08.530] - Speaker 1
So do they get permission from your parents to do that? How does that work?

[00:51:11.750] - Speaker 2
My mom green lighted it.

[00:51:13.030] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:51:13.910] - Speaker 2
And she couldn't control me. I wasn't going to school, wasn't doing anything. Really.

[00:51:19.900] - Speaker 1
So you're not taking drugs, you're just not going to school, and you're taking.

[00:51:25.050] - Speaker 2
The seven F bus to San Francisco. A bunch of kids are congregating in Justin Herman Plaza, so called Embarcadero. The EMB. I'm not a good skateboarder. So here's the thing. I hit puberty. Right on.

[00:51:36.660] - Speaker 1
But you feel like this is like your new family? Sort of.

[00:51:39.780] - Speaker 2
They were absolutely my family. Guys like Jim Thebow, these older guys who were around at the time, there was amazing skateboarding happening. Mike Carroll, Henry Sanchez, all these guys. Giovante Turner. I'm seeing, like, amazing skateboarding. This guy Greg Carroll was kind of a dad to everybody, even though he's, what, probably 18 at that time.

[00:51:58.120] - Speaker 1
How old are you?

[00:51:58.890] - Speaker 2
1414. So I started going to the city. San Francisco was our city. Taking the seven F bus or because I didn't have money, we would take the Cal train, and we would lie down coffin style on the top so they couldn't see us and then jump the turnstiles and run know? I learned how to do a lot of that from we had a kid who went to our school who was a foster kid named Aaron Curry. His real name was Aaron King. He was fostered by the Curry family. He eventually became a graffiti artist orphan, or FN, and he came up through the foster system. So he knew how to steal, he knew how to hide on trains. He knew how to do all of that. So I was hanging around with him a lot, and I would start hanging out in barcadero, and I loved it. I saw amazing skateboarding.

[00:52:42.220] - Speaker 1
All of these kids also not going to school. It was like everyone had the same.

[00:52:46.060] - Speaker 2
Idea, all either loveless or parentless families or just no control. In fact, I'll never forget Mike Carroll said to me, you don't have to go to school. I was like, Why not? He's like, eventually they just give up. And I was like, okay. Now he became a pro skateboarder, and this is an important point, which is that even though I hit puberty on time, I was skinny, and I kept getting hurt. My body wasn't strong yet. I'd shot up. I grew like, a foot during one summer between 8th grade and 9th grade. So I was like 6ft taller, six foot one, and I'm, like, 149 pounds, and I kept breaking my damn foot, and I wasn't strong. My body couldn't do it yet, had no pop, and I had no future in skateboarding. And it was super frustrating.

[00:53:26.270] - Speaker 1
You're still going home every night to sleep?

[00:53:28.460] - Speaker 2
Not necessarily. Some guys slept at Embarcadero. They would just drink or hang out. I wasn't into that. I slept a few nights there, but mostly just stayed up skateboarding. I had a friend named Ray Meyer, older guy who lived with his parents in the city. He was a computer programmer, lived in their attic, and I lived there for a while with him weekends or Fridays or whatever.

[00:53:50.940] - Speaker 1
And would you tell your mom you're doing this, or no?

[00:53:53.020] - Speaker 2
Sometimes. And that's eventually why they pulled me out of school. She was like, I was so worried about you. And I was just done.

[00:53:59.770] - Speaker 1
How many people in the group of kids?

[00:54:01.770] - Speaker 2
Okay, so the embarcader of the so called EMB crowd, because now it's legendary, could be as many as a couple hundred on a Sunday.

[00:54:08.890] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:54:09.540] - Speaker 2
Probably about 50 core guys. I was not one of the core guys, but I always had good optics. Like, I knew like, there was a guy they call James Kelch who was considered the mayor. If he was drinking, you had to pay him or he'd beat you up. That's a fact. But he liked me, and he was cool to me, and so I think I knew how to slide in. I always got along well with guys. I grew up in a big pack of kids down at the end of my street before they played water polo. We'd all hang out together. Then I went the way of the skateboard thing. So even though I wasn't a good skateboarder, they kind of let me hang out and be part of it. And I was smart enough to not get into the criminal side of it.

[00:54:48.350] - Speaker 1
Because it was as much about the camaraderie and community as it was about skateboarding.

[00:54:54.180] - Speaker 2
It was a place to go.

[00:54:55.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it was a group of, I'll say, like minded people that's right. Who want to get away from something else.

[00:55:01.440] - Speaker 2
That's right. And I was seeing amazing skateboarding, and Jim Thebow would roll in every once in a while. He had started real skateboards thunder trucks, which, by the way, this is one of the most amazing heists in all of know people hear about the different companies in Spitfire. You know, one guy owned all of those were all poured at the same factory, ermico, in Hunter's Point.

[00:55:24.680] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:55:25.340] - Speaker 2
But he came up with this genius idea of call it four different companies, and then they would, like, pit them back. Then they would pit the companies against one another. Whichever you bought, it was all going to the same place. Fausto Vitello was a genius in that way, but it was very San Francisco based. There was a. Southern California thing. But yeah, that was where I hung out, and I learned I stayed out of the stealing a lot. They would rob tourists and stuff. Like, if you saw that movie Kids, an equivalent thing was happening in Washington Square Park in the early 90s. Actually, some good friends of mine, LaVar McBride, Nick Lockman, a bunch of guys were in that movie Kids, and it was a mimic of kind of what was happening in Embarcadero, and it was.

[00:56:06.010] - Speaker 1
Probably happening in a lot of places.

[00:56:07.550] - Speaker 2
So Love Park, Philadelphia, eventually came along, and then Barcelona became a big spot. But yeah, it was an amazing time. I remember loving the crowd, feeling like you have a family, you show up. It was all, get the DAPs, get the hugs. Say, what's up? Like, there's my friend Carl Watson, who I still know, who lives in Oakland, works for Adidas Skateboarding. He would show up. He and this other guy, Nick Lockman, were like the greeting committee. And they'd show up and be like, what's up? And then someone happy to see me. That's actually all I really needed, to be honest. I just realized that now that I'd come home and there was no happiness there, but no one was happy to see me. Either my dad didn't want me living with him or was conflicted about that for whatever reason. So my school I went to this high school called Gunn High School. It's one of the most academically proficient high schools in the country. It also is the high school that has the highest suicide rate in the country. They don't like it when I say this because they actually got it wiped from their Wikipedia.

[00:57:08.580] - Speaker 2
But kids, there the suicide rates outrageous. Not when I went, but it's been an issue. This was written up. People can find that. Hopefully they've ameliorated that problem. But I went to the school where.

[00:57:20.500] - Speaker 1
Everyone it's wiped from Wikipedia.

[00:57:24.990] - Speaker 2
We can talk about Wikipedia. I'm happy to talk about Know. It was like my high school was all about every kid was obsessed with early admission to Ivy League school. X or Y or Z or know. Me and my friends started becoming bad kids, right? I mean, we literally burned down all the floats for homecoming. Actually, it wasn't me that lit the match, but we were bad kids. When we were in Palo Alto, I started going back to Palo Alto and thinking, this is Romper Room. That's where interesting stuff is happening now. The cool thing was I stayed out of drugs. I didn't get into drinking, but I wasn't good at skateboarding, and that was frustrating. I wasn't good at anything. And my friend Steve Rugie, or Steve Rugie then, who was a few years older than me, put me on the flow team for Thunder and Spitfire just out of frankly, out of sympathy. So I'd get a little product here and Know and I'd try and then I went to some of the big contests, the Reno Nationals. I'd go out there, I'd skate. I'd get like, last place. But I was trying.

[00:58:29.380] - Speaker 2
I was in it. And I look back and I remember thinking, there are no parents here. I'm at the Reno Fairgrounds when I should be at school, and I'm getting a little bit of money to eat from team manager or something, or I don't know, from working at the skateboard shop. So I was free. I mean, the one thing I was, was free.

[00:58:49.370] - Speaker 1
And this is from 14 to how old?

[00:58:51.280] - Speaker 2
So I did that from about 14 to 16. And then what happened was I hurt my foot again. I broke it a third or maybe a fourth time. And I was so depressed. And I remember so a condition of being let out of youth detention was I had to go to therapy. No one went to therapy back then. If they did, they didn't talk about it. So I started working with this guy who really helped me and tell me.

[00:59:12.720] - Speaker 1
What was detention like?

[00:59:14.260] - Speaker 2
Oh, man. So I'll say this, the first night when they locked the door, you're like, oh, shit. And I'll never forget it was a co ed hallway. My roommate was a guy. He looked like Richard Ramirez, the night stalker. Tall, long hair. He looked like that guy. And I remember in the same room as you, same room. I remember terrified. I'm thinking like and I'm like, I'm going to have to fight. I'm not big and strong, but I didn't know if he was going to rape me. I didn't know if he was going to kill me. I didn't know what he was going to try and do. Turned out he was like the nicest dude. He was like the best dude. But the first night, I remember being terrified.

[00:59:55.710] - Speaker 1
Were you guys same age?

[00:59:57.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but he was a lot bigger than I was. I was tall and skinny. He must have been like six, four. Wow. Yeah, he's a big kid. And then the other kids in there were dealing with different things. Some drug, some abuse. And I'll never forget the next morning they gather us up. They sit us around, and like the group therapy, how many in the group? I'm trying to probably about 1820, maybe. And I remember they said, listen, there's this holding chamber down the way of kids that are 14 and younger. And then there are the adults in the other wing. Now, the kids, the really young kids, they're crazy. And the older people, the 19 and up, they're crazy. But you guys, you're not crazy. And I remember thinking, that's exactly what they're telling the people in the other fucking places. I remember thinking like, how stupid do you think I am? I'm like so I thought to myself, okay, either I'm crazy or I'm just a bad kid. And for the first 72 hours or so, I just sat there. Didn't say a word. I was so pissed. And I got the phone call.

[01:01:01.970] - Speaker 2
You get your phone call. I called Steve Rugie. shrugI, shrugI. They locked me up. And he goes, Bro, he was a stoner back then. Not anymore. He goes, bro. He's like, Why are you calling me? And I'm like, I need help. And he goes, you're the most normal guy I know. I don't know how to help myself. And that's when I was like, okay, this is bad. Yeah. So after about 72 hours, I remember talking to one of the counselors there. They would come in three times a night, check us. They would do frisk search to the whole thing.

[01:01:34.640] - Speaker 1
How were they? Do you feel like their intentions were good?

[01:01:37.230] - Speaker 2
They were good people. Yeah, they were really good people. And looking back, I realized they must have made, like, nothing. They're trying to get clinical hours. The orderlies were kind of scary. It was like in the old movies where they come in in the white suits and they're like, checking you. And it wasn't a mental hospital. It was just youth detention. They had a girl's wing and a boy's wing, and then they'd mix us for therapy. And in the sessions, other kids are talking about drugs, sexual abuse and all sorts of stuff, and I'm not speaking. So they were convinced, the counselors were convinced that I must have experienced the exact same things because I'm hanging my head and not listening. And I remember, I'm like, no, I'm not saying anything, because what he's saying is absolutely gnarly, and I'm not going to claim that. And they're like, well, why are you here? And I'm like, I don't know why I'm here. Honestly, I don't know why. They started kind of pulling the threads, and I realized just how dark and depressing my life was at home and how I basically had not been in school or engaging in any typical youth stuff.

[01:02:33.810] - Speaker 1
Is that the first time you ever did anything therapeutic?

[01:02:36.470] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:02:37.030] - Speaker 1
And how old are you in this?

[01:02:39.250] - Speaker 2
I think I was like 14 and a half, 15.

[01:02:40.980] - Speaker 1
And how long were you there for?

[01:02:42.690] - Speaker 2
In the end? I ended up staying there for a little over a month.

[01:02:45.240] - Speaker 1
It's a long time for a kid.

[01:02:46.630] - Speaker 2
It was a long time. Yeah, it was a long time. And I couldn't skateboard, and that was my lifeline, even though I sort of sucked at it.

[01:02:55.900] - Speaker 1
Did you see your mom anytime during that month?

[01:02:57.450] - Speaker 2
So they'd come up both yeah, they'd come together. Apart together, and my sister, too. And it just made everything worse. Yeah, it was just they were at each other's throats, and it was just so bad. And so after a little while, I started talking to the counselors and realizing, what's the program? How do I get out of here? Yes. And so they're like, Listen, you get out of here by being really honest. And I'm like, well, I'm not lying. And they're like, but you're also not saying anything, which for me is unusual. So I start talking. Like, I start talking about what's been going on and the things I've been doing. And listen, by that time, also, I'd seen somebody murdered right in front of me in the city, stabbing. And here I'd seen some pretty crazy sexual stuff. The embarcadero was a bunch of Lost Boys. There were girls around, but it was mayhem. And it was fun and exciting on the one hand, but it was also dangerous and scary on the other, and kind of like a punk rock show. You're not sure how to feel about that. But at some point, I think I realized I was like, okay, I don't like being scared from my life.

[01:04:17.960] - Speaker 2
So I started working the program. Eventually I got out, but the condition was I had to go to therapy. So once a week. Now I'm back in Palo Alto. I'm going to classes, which was totally foreign to me. And also, people in my school knew that I got locked up. So now my friends are like, he's crazy. He's a criminal. And I say this. I do want people to know that when you treat someone that way, they become that. Like when Mike Tyson talks about how he became an animal, because people are always telling him what an animal he is. I have a small understanding of what that's like. So I'm going to therapy. The guy's awesome. He's like, hey, listen, you seem to have a big drive, and you're very interested in things. And he's like, you should stay away from drugs, and you should take care of your physical body. Maybe you should make your body stronger. So I started swimming. I started running. I used to hide it because for skateboarders, this was like the like it was jocks didn't hang out with skateboarders like a John Hughes film. So I was doing all that, and I was like, oh, I really love the feeling of running.

[01:05:19.780] - Speaker 2
Actually, there was a football coach at our school. I didn't play football. His name was Bob Peters. He taught me how to lift weights. And I was like, wow, my body is getting stronger. I couldn't do one pull up. I was so skinny. So I was like, this is cool. I'm starting to feel some control. I started reading a little bit, but then I got my first girlfriend. She was a year older than me, first real girlfriend. And I learned that her former boyfriend had been some big buff football player. So now I really start hitting the weights, right? I was like, this geeky kid. And my mom is still totally checked out. So I was like, okay, I need to take care of her. She's going off to college. I need to be a grown up. So I'll join the fire service. I like hanging out with dudes. I like working out everyone likes firefighters. People have mixed feelings about cops. So I started taking fire science courses down at Mission College and studying a little bit, going to class a little bit. Now, what's funny is I completely changed my physical look. Before that, I had, like, dyed black hair, super spiky, and I was skateboard kid.

[01:06:22.200] - Speaker 2
I went back to school, and I was like, I'm going to play this game. Started combing my hair to the side, wore a flannel. This is the 90s. I'm going to wear a flannel. I'm going to tone down the aggression a bit. And I started hanging out with her. Now, the downside was that her friends were really into drugs, so I started getting into LSD, smoking weed. And it's kind of interesting. The school would come around every once in a while. I'd do my weekly check in with them. They're like, you're doing great, because I looked cleaned up. But I was becoming a different kind of delinquent. And then got my girlfriend pregnant, worked my butt off, know, support us, because basically, even though she lived at like, I didn't have money for it. So I was, like, a little adult, and I'd learned how to do that from the Embarcadero and those guys. Greg Carroll. But I stopped skateboarding. I was just into that and her. And we had a pet ferret and all that. So what ended up happening is that she went off to college. She went to UC Santa Barbara, and she was my family.

[01:07:22.480] - Speaker 2
So what did I do? I got my car. I drove down there. I lived in the parking lot outside her dorm. And how could I make money? Well, I sold.

[01:07:30.650] - Speaker 1
She's one year older.

[01:07:31.620] - Speaker 2
One year older, right. And I was just terrified that we were going to split. And of course, now she's off at college, and of course she and I started seeing other people. I was mostly out of fear that I was going to lose her. And then she started doing it. Then I beat those guys up, and then she'd come back, and it's terrible behavior, but that's what things were like then. And then I was making money, basically. Well, I'll be honest. I was selling drugs because it worked. But then what happened was a bunch of guys showed up at my house when I was back home, demanded I give them everything I have. And I was like, this is getting scary. I'm getting basically some pretty scary characters showing up, like, stealing from me, but I can't call the cops. I was like, okay, this is bad. This is really bad. What am I going to do? So I decided to apply to college so I could be down there. So I applied. I took the Sat on a half tab of acid. And somehow how often were you doing acid?

[01:08:33.820] - Speaker 1
At this point?

[01:08:34.390] - Speaker 2
Far too much. Every weekend? Yeah, far too much. I do not recommend it.

[01:08:39.190] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like who you were before the acid and after the acid were different?

[01:08:43.740] - Speaker 2
Definitely. I mean, LSD has certain clinical applications nowadays, but for a young mind, it was just not good. I mean, I spent my junior prom on LSD. So blitzed out of my mind. I don't remember. She was a senior. My senior prom, I was so blitzed out of my mind on Psilocybin, I don't remember. Luckily, I never went near hard drugs. I've truly never done cocaine, never done speed, none of those things. But it was just so dumb. When I look back, I think about, I studied brain development. It was just terrible idea. Kids don't do psychedelics or if you're going to do them, do them in a clinical trial when you're an adult. I wasn't really into weed, didn't really drink, but I started drinking a little bit more. She had a thing for alcohol. And I loved her. Look, I adored her. I'd run to her house on the weekends and wash her car. I mean, I adored her, but I was a delinquent. So I take the Sat, somehow I break a thousand. And it must have been divine intervention because I literally don't remember reading the questions. I just remember filling out the bubbles.

[01:09:48.960] - Speaker 2
But then again, I was on a half tab acid, so who the hell knows? Anyway, I write a college entrance essay about my life and what had been happening. I was very honest and that I wanted to join the fire service and that I heard that having a bachelor's degree would help me maybe move up in the command there. And I got in. I got denied from every other school. I got into that one. Don't ask me how. So I go to UC Santa Barbara and I'm like, this is like a playground. This is crazy. Most of these kids have never drank or been away from home. But for me, the way I'd come up, it was just like easy pickings. So I didn't go to class, and it was just all about partying girls. My girlfriend and I at the time were getting in tons of fights, verbal fights, never physical fights. I was getting into a lot of physical fights. Pretty soon, people in that town knew not to go anywhere near us because we were like, Sidden Nancy. It's like, if you dated her, I was going to beat you up. If you dated me, she was going to beat you up.

[01:10:54.770] - Speaker 2
It was like crazy. It was crazy. And so what ended up happening was July 4, 1994, and our mutual friend Jack Johnson can attest to this story, was my girlfriend at the time was roommates with Jack's now wife. They were summer roommates, and Jack and a bunch of people had a party. I was living in a squat with my ferret, working at a bagel cafe. I had essentially flunked all my classes. The first year I got kicked out of the dorms on the last day, and I was forbidden from going within 200 yards of the dorms because I got into a fight. A guy stuck a key through my cheek, and it was just insanity. And we're coming back from the store, we'd picked up steaks for a barbecue, and it was clear that some guys were ripping off the house. And the guys I was with were like, let's get them. And I was like, hey, hey, trust me. That's not how you fight. You don't walk over going, we're going to kick your ass. You just walk over and you do it, because I'd been through that. Guys who are pigeon chesting, that whole thing never goes well.

[01:11:57.720] - Speaker 2
So we go over, verify that they're stealing. I hit a guy, hell breaks loose. He's with a bunch of other guys. At that point, at that point in my life, I was carrying a knife. So that comes out. All my friends scatter. They were kind of there or at least weren't willing to engage. Police show up. It was nuts. And I'll never forget the police said to me, they're like, Good job. And I'm lucky I didn't get arrested. But I remember feeling like good job. Like this sucks. This absolutely sucks. Like, I'm either going to kill someone or they're going to kill me. Nothing good comes from fighting. Nothing. If you have to do it to protect your family, fine, but nothing good. So I remember walking back to the place where I lived, and I thought, okay, I finally got to college. The girlfriend had left for the summer. I'm living in a squat with my ferret. I'm getting in fights. I'm almost getting arrested and or killing people. I'm like, officially a loser. I'm not good at skateboarding. I love music, but I can't play music. I'm officially a loser. So that day I wrote out, and I still have the journal page that I'm like, this is it.

[01:13:05.260] - Speaker 2
I'm not going to drink or do any drugs. Not going to sell drugs. I'm not going to get into fights. I'm done. I'm going to just go home and figure it out. So I took a leave of absence. I didn't drop out, but I took a leave of absence. I moved home, and I went to foothill college, community college, and I worked at a little cafe in Palo Alto called Hobie's. And I just went to the gym and studied, and I started taking classes, and I took a psychology class. I was like, that's cool. I took a biopsychology class. I was like, that's cool. And I was like, this is good. I'm good at this. I can memorize stuff I can learn. Now, at that point, I'm still not in touch with my dad, and I was living at home. My sister had moved home after college, and I would take her to the gym with me. And I just thought to myself, like, okay, this is like, this is it. This is survival. This is it. And then I started to realize, I love learning. And it was the same thing as when I was a kid with the fish or the whatever.

[01:14:04.510] - Speaker 2
I love learning, and so I'm going to do this. So I moved back to Santa Barbara. I lived in a studio apartment, just me, the girlfriend and I were still kind of, like, working it out, but I'd allow myself to go out once a month. I would party, but I kept it in check, and I would work out and study. And at that point, then I started getting straight A's, and I started working in the laboratory of a guy named Harry Carlyle, started doing experiments, and he drove a black truck. He smoked cigarettes in the fume hood, drank coffee. And I was like, he's punk as fuck. I like this guy. And his wife is beautiful. He seems really happy, and he's like, it's great. Your whole life as a tenured professor is learning. And I thought, my dad is going to be so happy if I succeed. And I don't want to give him the satisfaction. I thought, but I'm an idiot if I don't take this opportunity. So I just got into science, and from that point, I ended up graduating with high honors, blah, blah, blah. I got into Berkeley, did my master's at Berkeley, went up to Davis, did my PhD at Davis, went to Stanford, did my postdoc, went to UC Sandio.

[01:15:11.720] - Speaker 2
So at 19, it was like, I'm done being a screw up. Made a hard left into academic science, and in some ways reunited with the pre puberty childhood, delight in nature and animals and learning. And there's a bunch of stuff that happened in the course of my science career, not all of which was easy. In fact, a lot of hard stuff. But yeah, I've been working my ass off from 19 on. But I don't even like to say that because it's been pure pleasure. Right? Learn, teach, research.

[01:15:43.570] - Speaker 1
You found what you love.

[01:15:45.300] - Speaker 2
I reconnected with it. Yeah, all the aggression, all the like, I was never a hedonist. I never thought, oh, I'm going to party because it feels good, and I'm going to fight because it feels good. It was just I think I was like, most of the guys back then that I hung out with, we were all terrified. If you had any real prowess in anything, skateboarding with girls or anything, you were afraid that it was going to get taken away from you. And also we were all raising ourselves. This is what's so like, the most adult person I knew was Greg Carroll, who still a friend, but he was a know, he was a kid working out his own stuff, and so we didn't have Dads and Moms know, tell us, hey, this is what you do and this and that. And I eventually reconnected with my dad really it wasn't until I was a postdoc, but we went to therapy together because there was so much stuff over the years. And I got to learn his experience of why he left, got to understand what had really gone on with the decision around me moving in, not moving in.

[01:16:56.360] - Speaker 2
But I will say this. At 19, I realized no one's coming to save me. And so I got to figure it out.

[01:17:04.490] - Speaker 1
When you did get to reconnect with your dad, do you have greater understanding of what was going on? Is it different than what you thought?

[01:17:10.570] - Speaker 2
Totally different than what I thought, and I totally understand what was going on. And sometimes I'll say, I only wish that they had split up sooner. I don't I think I know from my own struggles in relationship that we're all doing the best we can with what we've got at the time. The best advice can be coming from the best people that we trust the utmost in our life. And attachment is so complicated because we can love and get attached to people that aren't good for us, and they can get attached to us, and oftentimes we're not good for them either. So it's taken a lot of years, and I've continued to struggle in terms of relationship and both in terms of making good choices and also in terms of showing up right. I've got a million problems with myself around how I've shown up in those prior relationships, and that's what I've tried to focus on, as opposed to focusing on how other people were wrong. But, yeah, I think I came to some clarity around what was really going on for him and for my mom, too. And look, now we've done and we do Thanksgiving as a group.

[01:18:24.550] - Speaker 2
Once my sister had a kid, then it made sense for everyone to work it out, so we do it. It's tense and weird.

[01:18:33.510] - Speaker 1
How much do you think the 14 through 19 experience impacted who you are now?

[01:18:40.230] - Speaker 2
Incalculable? And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It was like, what did Strummer say in that documentary yesterday when they asked him about Sandinista? It was a magnificent thing, is what he said. And then he said, I wouldn't change it for anything. He goes and that's after a lot of soul searching. I couldn't tell you in words what it felt like to show up to a scene with all these kids and some I knew history was happening. This is the thing. When I saw Skateboarding, I'd never been part of the early wave of anything. It was the kind of the second wave. It wasn't the bones brigade wave. It was that second wave of the late eighty s. Ninety s. But I knew something special was happening. I was just frustrated that I couldn't be more a part of it. Like I couldn't be one of the as. Shrewgi told me back then, he said, you're never going to be one of the big guys. He said that, and I remember being crushed. But it was also a gift, because I didn't try and do that. I wouldn't trade that for anything. Because even now, like with podcasting, I got to see this, and I still see the similarities between podcasting and the early days of skateboarding.

[01:19:42.250] - Speaker 2
The rules are still unwritten. And so we're figuring it out and it's so cool. And now I get to be part of at least earlyish cohort I've never hit something on time with science. I got into neuroscience right as it was emerging, and I think it was easier to break into it then than it is now. There were fewer people in it and there are a lot of other reasons. And I love doing science. I mean, when I started working in my PhD lab, I lived in the lab, saved money. I used the money for other things.

[01:20:13.250] - Speaker 1
You just had a cot in the room?

[01:20:14.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah, in the microscope room. And I'd shower in the monkey cage washer room and I go to the gym.

[01:20:20.720] - Speaker 1
How long did you do that for?

[01:20:21.750] - Speaker 2
Oh, months at a time. And then I did rent for a little bit. And I'd live with a girlfriend. And then I moved back into the lab. When I was a junior faculty member in San Diego, I had a home for the first time, a bulldog. I didn't know what a mortgage was, but I'd been effective in science and I got hired and they gave me a little bit of money for a house. Nice little house. And then I was commuting so much, I was like, this is stupid. Brought my fish tanks and my bulldog and my couch into the office. And I just lived in my office. My students thought I was crazy.

[01:20:52.870] - Speaker 1
Have you noticed that stores that sell aquarium equipment fish, it feels like a whole other world. Like, when you go to those shops, it's so unlike anything else in the world.

[01:21:06.260] - Speaker 2
I love the sound. Like, the sounds, the colors in the place. It's like you're underwater. Yeah, it's like you're underwater. You have to check out these Takashi Amano things. He was brilliant. There's a museum that he has in Japan. It's like being underwater. I brought my tanks to my office. I brushed my teeth in the sink there. And then when I moved to Stanford, I was living with my girlfriend in a basement apartment in Oakland. Because, look, the salaries for academics aren't great in the Bay Area was super expensive at the time, and I was saving up so that I could buy us a house. And then when we split up, I lived with friends for a little while. And then I just moved into my office. And I remember they told me, the administrators at Stanford said, you can't do this. It sends the wrong message. I was like, well, what message is that? You can't afford a place. To live. And I'm like, I can't afford a place to like and Costello, my bulldog, he thought it was cool, but shower at the gym, and then on the weekends, I could stay in a so or stay with, you know, eventually, I did buy a little house.

[01:22:10.650] - Speaker 2
I was fortunate to buy a little house in Oakland.

[01:22:12.480] - Speaker 1
And I put but it makes sense because you were dedicating your life to this thing, and you might as well live in the place where it's happening, because that's all you were doing anyway.

[01:22:20.440] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And I didn't have focus, total focus. And I'd still go to shows. I've always gone to shows. When I was a graduate student, I'd go up to the Colonial Theater in Sacramento, go to shows. Saw the Transplants play there, saw Maray and the Disasters play there. Like, always gotten energy from going out and seeing punk rock shows. Now, when I was in San Diego, I did at the beginning, and then I stopped, and that was one of the biggest mistakes I made. And then when I started again, it's like, I get energy by seeing that, creative energy. And I've always stayed in touch with the skateboard scene, either through communication with people or now that I have the podcast, a number of people have come back around. Jim Thiebau and I are friends through some weird twist of fate. I truly never had it in mind to become friends with Tim Armstrong, but I'm a huge Rancid fan. I got the tattoo, for God's sake. Band tattoo. Nobody gets banned. Tattoos. Who knows what they're doing? I got one on purpose right off their little Micro label. And then I got to be friends with Tim.

[01:23:18.910] - Speaker 2
And so I go hang out with Tim at his studio. Because to me, being around punk rock or skateboarding is the energy that we're trying to create in the podcast. When we get together, it's so different. It's not music, it's not skateboarding. But it's like, let's just mash up this stuff that we know is really cool. You know, this this is your history, too, right? With music. And Mike Blayback, the photographer for the podcast, is a guy that I helped get sober and get fit back in 2019 because I have a lot of connections to the sobriety community. We could talk about that, but when it came time to like, how do we brand this thing? How do we get Photos top cards? It's like skateboarders. How are we going to film it? Skateboarders. Poached. Two guys from DC Skateboarding, and we got a couple of other guys on our team who are not from the skateboarding thing, but they're full DIY. We're not going to do it through some big thing, because then they're going to tell us what to do. And it's all about not being told what to do. It's about doing the thing that feels right, because you guys just know it's really cool.

[01:24:18.370] - Speaker 2
And that's the thing about skateboarders is that style matters. How you do it matters. In fact, if you do, it the cool thing, but in an uncool way, it's worse than if you didn't do it at all. They will torment you. I mean, the hazing process that I came up through in skateboarding was so brutal. I hear about these fraternity hazings and how they kill them with alcohol. That's terrible in that dimension. But what I went through, I was physically afraid. I was socially afraid of being tormented, but it gives you a thick skin. And so the podcast thing, to me, just feels like it feels just like skateboarding, just like punk rock. I look at who the kind of tribal leaders are in know? Rogan lex, your podcast is roll. Tim Ferriss. You know there are a bunch more, right? But these are all people that, like, think are awesome, and they're doing great stuff, and it's not. They get something, and I don't. It's all like, Rising Tide raises all boats, and that was skateboarding. If somebody did something awesome, you weren't like, oh, I wanted to do it. It inspired you to go harder.

[01:25:28.490] - Speaker 2
So to me, it's the same energy in all the different things.

[01:25:33.530] - Speaker 1
Tell me your understanding of the DIY world.

[01:25:37.790] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the do it yourself DIY world to me is it starts with an understanding that this can be done. There's almost, like, unconscious confidence in it. We're just going to do this.

[01:25:58.050] - Speaker 1
We're not asking for permission, right?

[01:26:00.690] - Speaker 2
We're just going to do it. Why wouldn't we do it? Yeah, why wouldn't we do it? But it's just definitely when people hear DIY, I think they sometimes mistakenly think it means do it yourself alone. It's do it yourself, but always there's the component of pooling together the people that are right to make it happen.

[01:26:23.180] - Speaker 1
Finding the right people with that right sensibility of the same kind of people who feel like we can do it regardless of what anyone says.

[01:26:30.720] - Speaker 2
That's right. So you're not asking permission. You are also not looking for examples of how it's been like with the podcast. It was, okay, I want to do a podcast. Lex Friedman suggests I do a podcast. I was like, Why would I do a podcast? And he said, well, you seem really attuned to teaching and lecturing. Why wouldn't you? And I was like, oh, you're right. And then he said, but just make sure it's not just you, Blabbing. So I do that half the time. Not all the time.

[01:26:59.670] - Speaker 1
Was Lex the first professor to do a podcast?

[01:27:03.830] - Speaker 2
He's technically not a professor, and I don't say that to diminish his academic accomplishments, but he'll get on me if I don't catch that one. He's a Dr. Lex Friedman. He's a PhD, first formally trained scientist to do an independent podcast.

[01:27:18.370] - Speaker 1
Did he teach or did he not teach?

[01:27:20.540] - Speaker 2
Yes, he's been an instructor at MIT since 2015.

[01:27:25.180] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[01:27:25.660] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:27:26.140] - Speaker 1
So the difference between an instructor and a professor. I don't know what the he didn't.

[01:27:29.960] - Speaker 2
Run his own research group at MIT, so I have a research laboratory and I teach, and in the British system, instructor and lecturer are different things. It varies by country a bit, but he has a formal affiliation to MIT. And, yeah, he was first person to do that. And I remember thinking, this is way cool. I loved his podcast. When I discovered his podcast, I was like, oh, shit, I want to know that guy.

[01:27:55.500] - Speaker 1
What were the first podcasts you listened to?

[01:27:57.180] - Speaker 2
Tim Ferriss podcast. When I was a junior professor in San Diego, I was interested in health and productivity, and I was concerned about my health because when I was a postdoc, my health went south. My mental health went south because starting in high school, when I learned about lifting weights and running, and I was always reading about nutrition, I'd spend hours in the book stacks at Tower Books. I paid Mike Menser for a phone consult to learn how to weight train. I got really into health and fitness basically when I turned 16, and I learned how to get stronger, add muscle, learn how to run. I ran cross country my senior year just for the experience and to run. I love running, but I was always reading about supplements. I started taking supplements in high school, some protein supplements and some amino acid supplements. It wasn't much around then. I was always learning. And then by the time I was a postdoc, I wasn't working out as much. I wasn't getting my sunlight. I was staying up late, going to shows, and my health was really dwindling. And I got things back on track when I moved to San Diego.

[01:29:00.370] - Speaker 2
And in part, that was because I read Tim's book, The Four Hour Body. I started listening to his podcast.

[01:29:05.670] - Speaker 1
It was a great book. I love that book.

[01:29:06.930] - Speaker 2
It's a great book. I still go back to The Four Hour Body and glean important information.

[01:29:11.240] - Speaker 1
That was the first place I learned about cold, about a lot of things.

[01:29:15.250] - Speaker 2
Tim seems to always be five to ten years ahead of the curve. It's remarkable on so many things, investing and all of that. It's an area that I did not get into. And I'm sure there are failures in his portfolio, but he has an amazing success rate because I think he's a forager. He's systematic and he's brave. I've become friends with Tim, and he's a DIY guy for sure. He seems to do a lot of it alone, even though he has friends and connections. He seems a bit more of a lone wolf. I'm not a lone wolf. Those years in San Diego were dreadful for me. I need that pack. That non biological family was my fucking know, and it still makes me choke up because it's still my lifeline while I've been here with, like I'll just be honest, like, I've been out here with you, and it's just amazing. But I have to be careful, because to this day, I still go visit families. I'm out here with your family. I visit friends that are families, and I start feeling like, oh, will they adopt me? I know it seems crazy, but as a professor, when my girlfriend and I split, I went and lived with a family in Santa Cruz that I'm friends with.

[01:30:28.350] - Speaker 2
It's taken a lot for me to learn how to set up a home for myself and do that, because it's not my, you know, my podcast know, Rob, Mike, and Ian, and there are a bunch of other important people there, too, but that's like, the core at times. We'll be hanging out, we'll be working, and I'm like, Man, I love this so much. And sometimes it'll make me kind of a little anxious, like, oh, my God, what if something happens to one of them? What will I do? So I think my brain didn't I didn't attach to my family the same way or I did, but then I detached, and I've got this idea in mind that I always need to have someplace to go. And it's not a sob story. It's just how I'm wired, and so I couldn't do what Tim does.

[01:31:17.910] - Speaker 1
You're trying to create the family that you didn't have when you were a child.

[01:31:21.820] - Speaker 2
That's what it is. And I have 100% love and trust for my friendships. Yes, and I'm blessed with incredible male friendships. Like, incredible. And, yes, I've prioritized that over pretty much everything, because that was something that, to this day, I could just really count on.

[01:31:44.050] - Speaker 1
That was the skater community, that was a skateboard community.

[01:31:47.060] - Speaker 2
And then mean, the people I talked to most are you Atea Blayback, Paul Conti, you know, Rob, Ian, you know, and there are others, right? Tim spent a lot of time with, you know, and there are others. I've got other friends. But it's my feeling of safety if I were to wake up and even just conceive of not having that. So it's just terrifying. It would be like it's existential dread for me. So anyway, the DIY thing is about for me is about then you don't ask permission, and you gather the right people. So for the podcast, it was Mike. He's a world class photographer, but he's also just the best dude.

[01:32:30.930] - Speaker 1
So Lex suggested doing.

[01:32:32.350] - Speaker 2
Lex suggest?

[01:32:32.970] - Speaker 1
How it started.

[01:32:33.680] - Speaker 2
Lex suggested I went to Rob Moore, who was representing me for PR, because in 2020, I started going on podcasts. Wasn't selling a book. I was just going on podcasts, and he was helping me book those, and I was paying him for it.

[01:32:45.830] - Speaker 1
And did you like the experience of going on podcasts?

[01:32:48.270] - Speaker 2
Loved it.

[01:32:48.940] - Speaker 1
Great.

[01:32:49.260] - Speaker 2
I loved it. I felt useful. The whole thing was, in 2019, I started posting a little bit on Instagram just for fun and talking science. In 2020, the pandemic hit, and Rob was going to represent me for my book, but he's like, look, the book thing is kind of slowing down now. But people are going on podcasts. They're going remotely. Some people are still having them in person, maybe just go. So I was like, all right, cool. So I started going on podcasts, and I was, like, really excited about it because at the time, the world was kind of falling apart psychologically. And I thought, I'm not going to get into this whole vaccine thing. That's a barbed wire tangle. And also, by the way, I was forbidden from talking about it. There were rules that Stanford put forth. And also, it's not my expertise, but what I do know about, because my lab works on, is anxiety. Tools to overcome anxiety, sleep, circadian rhythm, how to get your sleep right, exercise, physical health, mental health. So I'm like, okay, I can be of value and go on these podcasts and just teach and share.

[01:33:51.760] - Speaker 2
And I felt great doing it. And I wasn't selling anything I had no go to.

[01:33:57.500] - Speaker 1
Did you ever teach in a classroom environment at any point?

[01:34:00.860] - Speaker 2
I did. So as soon as I got my job at UC San Diego, I started teaching. I actually taught more than I was required to. I started a course called Neural Circuits and Health and Disease. And it looked a lot like the podcast. And it started with 50 students the first year, and it ended with 450 students, and it was taught at night. I like teaching.

[01:34:21.350] - Speaker 1
Is it fun?

[01:34:22.080] - Speaker 2
I loved it. I loved it. I absolutely loved it. And I'd bring Costello my bulldog, and he loved it because he'd have this harem of people, like petting him and giving him salami and stuff. And I loved teaching at night because I always find that the students are more relaxed at night. And we would explore papers, and it was a bit more free form, and I never thought it would become a podcast. But even as a graduate student, I took opportunities to teach. And I taught a summer course as a postdoc and as a junior faculty member at Cold Spring Harbor in Long Island, just summer camp for scientists. I ran a course on visual neuroscience.

[01:34:58.120] - Speaker 1
It seems like you were meant to do this. Like you're hardwired to do this job.

[01:35:03.780] - Speaker 2
To learn and teach.

[01:35:04.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah, there are so many people who teach, but it's not their strength. Maybe they're connected to the subject they're teaching, but you seem to really be connected to the act of teaching.

[01:35:15.930] - Speaker 2
I love teaching. I love learning and teaching. For me, the podcast is pure delight because it's go learn stuff, talk to experts in the field, look at the literature, form my own opinions, too. Learn it and teach it, and the world gets it for free if they have an Internet connection. And yes, we have sponsors, sure, but they get paid if people want to buy the stuff, and you don't have to. It's, like the perfect ecosystem. So to me, the DIY thing made Know Lex is like, start a podcast. So I went to Rob and said, I want to start a podcast. And he was already doing a podcast called The Fight with Teddy Atlas. Rob's interesting guy. He was working in PR in New York, but he's always liked sports, spectator sports, but he liked boxing and MMA. And he had this thing for, you know, old school guy who's a commentator who'd come up. He used to work in Tyson's Camp years ago, and he's got big scar on his face. He's from Staten Island. And he pulled Tedy out of retirement, basically. And they started The Fight with Teddy Atlas Podcast, which is they interview fighters before fights, and they talk about the fights that happened last weekend.

[01:36:21.530] - Speaker 2
It was like pure heart for Know. He's an interesting guy, Rob. He runs Iron Man's and all this stuff. But I'd worked with him for about a year, and I said, what do we need to do a podcast? He said, well, here are the cameras you need. Here are the recording stuff. So I went and got it. I went and bought it. And then I moved to Topanga Canyon. I was teaching remotely moved to Topanga.

[01:36:42.070] - Speaker 1
Canyon, because everyone was teaching remotely at that.

[01:36:44.160] - Speaker 2
Everything was remote. And I love Topanga. I moved to Topanga because Oliver Sachs, who is a neurologist and a writer, wrote about the brain, lived in Topanga. So I was like, cool.

[01:36:55.970] - Speaker 1
I didn't know that.

[01:36:56.710] - Speaker 2
That's cool. And he was really into weightlifting and fitness.

[01:36:59.870] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:37:00.470] - Speaker 2
And he died in 2015. But I've always admired him. And so I was like, cool. I'm going to move there. And there was a street called Vision Drive. And I work on the visual system, so I'm like, It's fate. So I moved into the old Fleetwood Mack house. It was like a barn.

[01:37:13.650] - Speaker 1
Cool.

[01:37:14.320] - Speaker 2
And I put a gym in the main bedroom, my bulldog. And we started the podcast in a closet, literally a closet. And Rob lived up the road. And then Mike Blaback, who did the branding, know photos for DC. Skateboarding lakai girl. Skateboards DGK done a lot with supreme. He knows Bill Strobick and those guys. He was my friend. I was like, hey, we need a Top card. Will you do this? So he took some photos, and I told Rob, I was like, we should bring this guy in just so that the photos are the same on every Top card. And Rob at first said, yeah, I don't know. Is that really important? And I'm like, Trust me, this guy, the branding. Like, just the look, like, even just the fonts. And he kind of knew what I was talking about, but that wasn't me. I'm like, It's got to look right, and I don't care if anyone else notices. And then I said, I want a song at the beginning in the bumper up front. And my favorite song is Burning Lights by Joe Strummer. And we tried to get the rights to Burning Lights.

[01:38:15.800] - Speaker 2
Too expensive. So talked to Mike, and he was like, oh, skateboarders. Have a solution for this. Like, you can change a certain number of chords, and then I hope I don't sink myself with the copyright on this one. But anyway, no, because you changed the change. We had a guy play it, change a few of the chords, put that up front. And I was like, yes. It's a strummer song. At the beginning, it's got pictures of my favorite science memorabilia.

[01:38:38.770] - Speaker 1
It's a Strummer like song.

[01:38:39.820] - Speaker 2
Strummer like song. It's a Strummer like song. At the beginning, strummer inspired strummer inspired strummer tribute. Strummer tribute. Exactly. Love him. Never met him, but I know him through you, thankfully. I ask so many questions about him whenever I see you. Okay, so it was just pull the guys together. And then we needed to do a bunch of stuff, like uploading to RSS feeds and all this stuff, like, I don't know about. And so I knew this kid at Stanford Media, Ian Mackey, was like, let's hire Ian. And Rob was like, I don't know. Do we really want to bring inside? Boom. Once the four of us got together, perfect chemistry. And we just released in January 21. And the first six months, it literally felt like it was just, like, pouring out of me because I've been carrying all this stuff for a long time, and I'd gone on podcasts, but the moment I sat down and was just like, all right, let's learn about sleep and circadian rhythms. Let's learn about dreaming. Let's learn about testosterone and estrogen, because I'd worked on endocrine stuff. I'd worked on thermal regulation, so hormone stuff, cold, neuroscience stuff.

[01:39:45.930] - Speaker 2
I mean, they've all been in here, and I just like that kid with a grunt. With the tourette's thing, I was just.

[01:39:52.050] - Speaker 1
Like.

[01:39:54.990] - Speaker 2
I don't even remember feeling like it was ever work. It's never felt.

[01:39:58.970] - Speaker 1
How much research does it take to put together an episode?

[01:40:01.830] - Speaker 2
Depends on the topic. So if it's a topic about, say, visual system or brain development, you know, I know it. So maybe four or 5 hours to kind of piece together, maybe 2 hours. Even if it's a different topic, like the one that we did on hair and hair growth or fertility, which we did. I wanted to have one comprehensive video that any couple could watch if they were thinking about having a child and thinking about fertility or egg freezing or embryos. That was 11 hours of recording and probably 100 hours of prep. So it varies widely. And I'm fortunate also to have a really deep roster of experts in my life that I can just text or call. So, as you know, if someone has a question about eye stuff, I get the chair of Stanford on the phone now. I have a question about endocrine stuff. Urology Michael Eisenberg, our head of male urology reproductive health at know a psychiatrist, conti. So I'm very fortunate to have this community of people that not all of them are likely to go on podcasts, or if they do, they might go on one or two.

[01:41:07.540] - Speaker 2
There are exceptions to that, of course, but one of the things that I feel very lucky to be able to bring forward is the voices of experts, either through my words or by putting them on as guests. Because, let's face it, there is tremendous range of knowledge and quality out there in terms of academics and clinicians, and most of what the general public gets to see and who they have access to is pretty meager.

[01:41:35.990] - Speaker 1
You're in a very interesting position because you have access to these experts at a time when it seems like most people are questioning the information coming from experts more than ever before. Even though you're coming from Stanford, you have credibility in spite of your credentials.

[01:41:57.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that what I like to think I'm good at, is vetting the information, getting to the right people for the particular question, getting to the right information, because especially in the landscape of health or what to do. I mean, there's so much garbage out there, and sometimes the garbage isn't quote unquote, false information or misinformation. Sometimes it's just like muddled. We just had this episode with Dr. Reena Malik, who's a urologist, talks about reproductive health, sexual health, and the questions were very straightforward, like, what are the different causes of female sexual dysfunction? Are they hormonal? Are they pelvic floor? Are they vascular? Okay, depends. What about for male sexual dysfunction? What about bicycle seats? What should people do? Okay, here are the five things that they should do. Bicycle seats turn out to be bad if you're on them for a certain amount of time, blah, blah. It doesn't depend on whether or not you have a prostate. It's that the blood supply, the perennium, gets cut off, people get okay, so it's straightforward. If you get a person like Rina in the seat across from you, she'll just tell you about anything.

[01:43:09.970] - Speaker 2
I mean, we actually had to cut about an hour of dialog because it got into some pretty intense territory around some topics like BDSM and things like that, which we decided for our show wasn't right or wasn't the right time. But those conversations weren't like salacious. It was just questions and straightforward answers based on extensive clinical experience and actionable takeaways. And the problem now is that you go on there like, let's say somebody, God forbid, has Alzheimer's or somebody in their family has Alzheimer's. What have they heard? Okay, Alzheimer's might be diabetes of the brains. Should they do the keto diet? I don't know. There's no clinical trials. But what about this drug? What about the fact that the last five drugs didn't seem to work. Or that the whole theory of Alzheimer's got flipped on its head from a data fabrication last year. You're terrified, and no one's telling you what to do. So you go to a neurologist and they tell you, well, there's not a whole lot you can do. You can take this prescription, you can take that prescription. No discussion about how it works or why it works. Why is mechanism important to understand?

[01:44:14.980] - Speaker 2
Because if you understand that it has something to do with acetylcholine, well, then you can think about other ways to increase acetylcholine. Because guess what? There are other ways. And so I benefited a lot from the fact that my third advisor, who was an MD and a PhD, ben Barris, sadly died of pancreatic cancer. But prior to that, we hung out a lot. And he had absolutely no reverence for the standard system. Zero minus one reverence. He believed in certain prescription drugs, of course, and he also believed that there was a ton of garbage in the literature. And he also understood that there was a lot of financial interests that were problematic. And he also understood that nutrition counts, supplementation can count, whether or not people that's a tricky thing for people.

[01:45:06.130] - Speaker 1
But he went to the hospital and found out he had a diabetic problem, and the hospital gave him his new diet for when he left the hospital. And he, for example, was restricted to only eating two slices of white bread a day.

[01:45:19.240] - Speaker 2
White bread is basically sugar. Yeah, which for a diabetic is a bad idea.

[01:45:23.100] - Speaker 1
Couldn't be more poisonous bad idea. And if you went to the hospital today, that's what they tell you.

[01:45:27.480] - Speaker 2
Well, I can tell you that there are some healthy doctors, but there are many, many very unhealthy doctors. And I know this because I grew up in a community of doctors and scientists. I would say the same thing. Occasionally you'll get like a health nut scientist. But you and I were talking about this earlier. I think one of the issues is that in Western medicine and in Western science, we are trained to be ultra specialists. You asked how we get our laboratory. The way we get our laboratory, I said, was you define a very specific vision for your lab. My lab is going to do blank, and you become the world expert in that thing. That's how you define yourself in the American system and in the Northern European system, it's all about the independent investigator. There's very little opportunity for integrating things from other but it's the example of.

[01:46:19.500] - Speaker 1
You are the expert hammer manufacturer. So you're looking for the nail to hammer.

[01:46:23.830] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Well, and when I moved to Stanford in 2016, I started studying respiration, deliberate, breath work as a means to I was testing can it be an effective intervention for anxiety and stress? And turns out the answer is yes. Even just double inhale through the nose long exhale can reduce anxiety quickly. Done repeatedly for a few cycles, you can improve nighttime sleep, overall mood, and not just while doing the breath work and immediately after. Okay, that's what we discovered. And so on. In the 1970s and 1980s, a small collection of students proposed that respiration and maybe meditation could be useful for mental health at Stanford. They were not escorted off campus, they were forced off campus. And a couple of them moved down to this place called Esalen.

[01:47:14.550] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:47:15.850] - Speaker 2
Fast forward to 2020 studies of psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD and MDMA. MDMA is more of an empathogen than a psychedelic, but are now going full bore with government support, donor support and legal permission.

[01:47:33.310] - Speaker 1
And these are all things that were vilified in the past.

[01:47:35.880] - Speaker 2
I could list off five to ten Harvard professors that were fired for suggesting the mere idea. So meditation made it through the shoot. Breath work came later, but even when I was looking at this stuff in 2016, it was considered kind of wacky breath work. Now breathwork is through the shoot. The idea that changing your patterns of breathing deliberately could change your state of mind and body for the better, everyone's on board that you don't have to do it, but most people are like, okay, cool, makes sense. In fact, there's a lot of mechanism to explain it. The idea that mindfulness meditation might be a good thing, maybe even kids should do it makes sense. Maybe psychedelics. With the appropriate controls and support for some people, not all could be helpful. People are on board. But each one of those things separately was considered an absolute violation of code of conduct, of ethics. It was illegal. And in many ways it was quote unquote, illegal in academics, academic science. To talk about respiration or breath work, people, you might as well have said you want to study levitation or you want to study how genies come out of bottles.

[01:48:50.820] - Speaker 2
And so now when somebody comes forward and know, yeah, I'm curious about, like, acupuncture, a lot of people disacupuncture. But Chufuma's Lab at Harvard Med, thank goodness, is publishing papers in top tier journals showing that when needles are introduced to particular places in the body, particular glands respond with release of immune molecules or molecules that stimulate molecules of the immune system, that defend against infection and on and on.

[01:49:19.170] - Speaker 1
And it's been known for 3000 years.

[01:49:20.850] - Speaker 2
It's been known forever. I have nothing against academic science or my colleagues. Some of them are very open minded. The system of funding for it just constrains people to this single track hypothesis thing. And look, science needs that too.

[01:49:38.510] - Speaker 1
But it's also not a single track hypothesis for the public good. It's a single track hypothesis where there's probably some upside.

[01:49:48.880] - Speaker 2
Yes. And the upside is rarely financial for scientists. I must say this I feel in fairness to the academic community, maybe not.

[01:49:56.770] - Speaker 1
For scientists, but for somebody, for somebody very.

[01:49:59.700] - Speaker 2
Few scientists get rich. Some do, but very few scientists get rich. Scientists are interested in discovering things, and yes, they are human. They are interested in career advancement. They are interested in career advancement. In fact, the system, whether or not you have tenure or not, demands career advancement. So I'm not cynical, but I know how the game is played from the inside. I was on an NIH panel as a standing member for four years until just recently, where I stepped down because my term was up, right? They didn't ask me to leave early. I understand how the funding game is played. I understand philanthropy. I understand how that game is played. I understand about patents. I understand how certain things make it to clinical trials and how certain things go from clinical trials to productization in companies. I can also tell you about major biotech companies in the Bay Area that are founded on discoveries that everyone in the lab knew was complete and total bullshit. And yet those companies will thrive because they'll just pivot to a new drug and a new drug. And I'm not in the business of outing people or writing exposes.

[01:51:07.600] - Speaker 2
But if you think that everything is right angles and people just trying to get the answer right, I'll tell you right now there's some amazing scientists who are absolutely committed to the truth, and there are a lot of them who are committed to their careers, and they're not lying. But you're not hearing about the stuff that didn't work, and you're also hearing about things through a particular tunnel of understanding and focus. And I don't claim to have the full 360 degree picture, but that's why I like to talk to people who are practitioners, clinicians. I like to talk to people who are just like, ten degrees off from that. Nurse practitioners often know things that doctors don't because they're down there in the weeds. I like talking to people who for which there's no degree. And I'm interested in prescription drugs, supplementation, behavioral tools, eastern medicine, western medicine, whatever the hell you want to call it. I'm interested in all of it.

[01:52:12.570] - Speaker 1
Whatever works.

[01:52:13.340] - Speaker 2
Whatever works. And I have my taste, and that's what I can't help but inject into what I choose and what I choose to communicate about. But if people are wondering how we got ourselves into this mess of lack of trust of experts, it's because we are not broad enough about who we consider an expert. We're too narrow in terms of who we consider an expert. At least that's my belief.

[01:52:37.660] - Speaker 1
If you could rewrite the way the whole system works, what would you change?

[01:52:43.010] - Speaker 2
Well, I think for any patient who has an unknown condition, like, they don't know what's going on with them, they would see in my ideal world, they would see four or five different people, each with very different perspectives. Then those four or five people would communicate, and they'd come up with a plan of action that's foremost. So let's say it's a psychiatric issue like depression. I think they should talk to I could imagine a quick meeting with four people a clinical psychologist, a psychiatrist who's more on the neurochemical prescription writing side or orientation, somebody who maybe is very somatic in their orientation, and then somebody who's really about lifestyle interventions. If they talk and they're a team, they're a squad that has good chemistry, I think that patient's going to walk out of there with three or four things to do and a bunch of questions that need answering and some tests, and they're going to arrive at a solution much faster. And I would have at least the greatest degree of confidence that they're going to do well. Right now, they'll see any one of those people, and it'll be X number of years of either success or failures before they arrive where they need to go.

[01:53:54.030] - Speaker 2
That would be the first thing. So there's got to be communication across.

[01:53:56.860] - Speaker 1
Broad spectrum from experts, from different modalities.

[01:54:00.500] - Speaker 2
Yes. I believe in panels, not individuals. In fact, I'll say this about the pandemic. One of the things that always perplexed me was, why isn't there a panel? Why is individuals now? I'm sure behind any individual there's a panel. There may be, but when a patient or citizen hears from a panel, it's different. And also nowadays, everything is about getting diversity of opinion. You can't get diversity with an individual by definition. So you want panels. The panels don't have to be 100 people. I think three or four is a good number, and it's totally workable. And I think anyone who is in the fortunate position of having the finances to get real medical workups, even if they have a primary doctor, nowadays, that primary doctor nine times out of ten is having them talk to behavioral interventionist, physical therapist, an immunologist, as the case may be. I mean, for someone diagnosed with cancer or a kid with depression, or somebody who just wants to improve their health overall, you have to go to ten different people or have a doctor who has an extensive network of experts in their clinic. And so it's no surprise to me that people get very attached to the one thing that feels like it worked until it doesn't.

[01:55:18.550] - Speaker 1
And the one thing that feels like it worked might work for one person and not another.

[01:55:22.180] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. And so with a panel that has good chemistry that is willing to pivot quickly, I think we could get much further much faster. I mean, I've got a friend. He's down San Diego. He said, I've got vertigo and my ear hurts. And I said, have you been checked out for an ear infection? No. Why not? Well, I went and the doctor said, It's the vertigo. And I said, well, the vertigo will be the consequence of the ear thing. He said, well, okay, so do I need antibiotics? I said, I don't know. Clearly he needs to talk to an ear, nose, and throat person. A primary care physician is not going to be able to solve this. This guy's really suffering. But one example of somebody that is probably going to pinball around in the system for a couple of weeks until it resolves or it doesn't, but to me, it's like it's not rocket science. We have the expertise. They're just not arranged in the right categories into the right collections of people.

[01:56:18.280] - Speaker 1
You mentioned earlier journaling when you were 19. When did you start journaling?

[01:56:22.830] - Speaker 2
I started journaling when I was about 14. Jim thebo this guy who runs these skateboard companies amazing guy, by the way. He's a very humble he takes care of a lot of people in skateboarding, and he's known still as one of the most giving and supportive people in that community. He had a couple of books, one called Loose Change and another one called do the Distance. And these were short stories and poetry that he wrote, and I think they were published by High Speed Press, which was Thrasher. But I still have them. He gave me a couple copies, or maybe I bought them, I don't remember. But I remember thinking, like, he's writing about some hard stuff here in his life, and it really helped know this chokes me up too, because I carried do the Distance with me when I got locked up. I carried it to college. I still have that book on my shelf. That little gray book was my lifeline. And so I started writing early on, and I still have all my journals. I don't go back and read them, but it's always pen on paper these days. I might voice dictate something into the phone to capture something, and then I bring it.

[01:57:39.410] - Speaker 1
When do you do it?

[01:57:40.930] - Speaker 2
Anytime, but usually in the morning, especially if I'm struggling on planes. I get a lot of writing done on planes because you just detach.

[01:57:49.100] - Speaker 1
Do you typically do it every day?

[01:57:51.050] - Speaker 2
Most every day?

[01:57:52.140] - Speaker 1
Most every day.

[01:57:52.870] - Speaker 2
And I definitely take notes in my phone every day. The phone is pretty convenient because it dates it. There are a bunch of things about the phone that are helpful. And actually, on the flight over here, I spent some time looking through my notes across the last two years. I also have a folder on my computer that blocks my life by years, and each inside of those are some Word documents with what happened during those years. I'm not afraid of losing my memory. In fact, the only time I've ever lost my memory was when I was prescribed an antidepressant when I was a postdoc and my memory started really suffering. And so I came off the antidepressant, my memory came back. But I have a pretty good memory.

[01:58:32.690] - Speaker 1
What might a typical journal entry be like?

[01:58:35.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, so this morning I went out by the pool, and I was just walking tend to get my ideas in the morning. And I wrote I go, oh, shit. I'm really focused on other people stuff right now. And I don't know if it's a defense against thinking about what's really going on with me or if that's what's really going on with me is I'm focused on other people, right? So it's just kind of like mind chatter. And then I wrote, the important thing to me, or the important thing, is to never look down on anyone or look up to anyone too much. I'd like to be like on level ground with people, to understand them. But I also am really keenly aware of how I can get pulled into other people's stories and stories about them. And I wish I was more like Rick. That's what I wrote. I can show you.

[01:59:30.280] - Speaker 1
It's interesting, the process of writing something down that you're not really planning on going back to in somehow is the process of writing it a way of locking it into yourself?

[01:59:42.730] - Speaker 2
Yes. So on my computer, for instance, I have a couple of stickies, those sticky function in Mac, those yellow tabs, and I'll put stuff in there and then I'll delete those out if they don't seem to matter over time. But I'll read those every once in a while. And like in the top left corner, I think I say something like completing something feels really good because I have this feeling sometimes, like mid morning, my productivity energy will start flowing. And if I don't capture that, I won't feel so good. But if I do something, I finish it and I'm like, I have energy. It's like sort of like a really good workout can give you energy. I just like, whoa. And so that's sort of a reminder type thing. So I do go back and read that certain things just hang out forever because it matters and it works. But most of the time when I write, it's either to clear out clutter or to stamp down something. And you know what's funny? I also have these lists, these word docs that I made in the years 2011 to 2015 when I was a junior professor.

[02:00:47.210] - Speaker 2
Really hard years for me. I was in a really self destructive time in my life. Even though my lab was flourishing, I was really not doing well. And I would write at that time I had these little lists and it was like I would write it's so funny. I'm half embarrassed to say this, but not really, I just chuckled. It said, this list I can show you. It said Jim thebo Mike Menser, tim Armstrong. I didn't know Tim at that time. I had met Jim, hadn't talked to him in years, knew Mike before he died. I'd like David Burson. He's a scientist. Jonathan Horton joe Strummer. Like, lists of people that I respect and look up to. And I would go to that document and just look at it and be like be more like so I've created this committee of mentors for myself. I never really sought them out directly, but these are people who I've always.

[02:01:44.710] - Speaker 1
Looked up maybe like inspirational figures.

[02:01:46.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but to embody to try and embody some component, like, I'm not going to sing and play guitar like Tim or Strummer. Like, hell no, that's not my thing. I'm not going to run a skateboard company. But I remember Jim's generosity is something that I feel like we can the energy that he embodies in things is what I'm interested in. And of course, he has flaws like everybody else, but that's not what I'm accessing. Right. I'm not trying to make people perfect or iconic, but that, to me, they are they're like my guides.

[02:02:21.750] - Speaker 1
What I'm hearing is that these are people who are true to themselves.

[02:02:25.220] - Speaker 2
Yes. And listen, it's weird to say because I already said I'll be more like, you're on my list. I have this list, blayback's on my list. You're on my list, conti's on my list. ATI is on my know there's a list of people barbara Chapman, clearly for different reasons. Definitely for different reasons. But you know what it makes me feel? It's like it makes me feel crude up inside, because it's one thing to look out and be like, man, my friends are doing amazing things, and I trust them, and they're cool people, and they're running their relationships and their businesses with the utmost drive and integrity, all that, but that's looking out at them. But this is about being crude up on the inside. And yeah, maybe it's from a kid who didn't I don't think I attached right to my parents. I definitely didn't. I love them, and I know they love me back. I'm super attached to my sister. I love her. I would do anything within the bounds of ethics for her. But I don't think I attached to family, my own family, the same way that most people attach. I think I attach to this community of dudes that are doing stuff.

[02:03:33.960] - Speaker 2
And so whether or not they're with me or not, or whether or not we're in communication or not, I'm trying to make them proud by being myself and in the ways that being myself is not going to make them proud. I'm definitely where I'm like, don't go there. So a lot of people are like, I want to make my family proud. It's like, yeah, I guess I could get into that mindset. But for me, it's like, I want to do a good job on the podcast for me and for the listeners, but it's also like, my team, they're my family.

[02:04:05.040] - Speaker 1
Do you ever feel a sense of competition?

[02:04:07.870] - Speaker 2
Not with any of the people I'm talking about. Not with any other podcasters, with anyone.

[02:04:11.940] - Speaker 1
At all about anything.

[02:04:13.380] - Speaker 2
I'm not a competitive person. I love what I love so much, but I'm not accustomed to anyone trying to take it away.

[02:04:20.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[02:04:21.440] - Speaker 2
So if someone was like, I'm going to no.

[02:04:30.150] - Speaker 1
Because what you're into is personal, so it can't really compare to.

[02:04:34.410] - Speaker 2
What anyone else no one can do what I can do and I can't do what they can do.

[02:04:37.900] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[02:04:38.410] - Speaker 2
And in my scientific career, I never once had the experience of going to a meeting and thinking, oh, I wish I was working on that. I was always working on the thing that interested me the most at that time. And then with the like, I love other podcasts. I genuinely listen to your podcast, lex's podcast and Joe's podcast and Tim's podcast, and I listen to some others. Also, Chris Williamson is doing amazing stuff now and again. I'll see it and be like, yeah, I like some of the Comedian podcasts, the Segura Kreischer thing. Andrew. Andrew scholes. I love that stuff, but I've got my core stuff. But I never, ever think, like, oh, I should be doing that ever. It would never occur to me, no.

[02:05:25.610] - Speaker 1
What's it like speaking in front of people?

[02:05:28.330] - Speaker 2
Well, we do these lives that have, like, 3500 people or something. What's it like, the beacon? Well, I came up teaching in the classroom, so it's a lot like that. The room's a buz. You come out and world goes quiet, and then it's just your voice. I like it. I like teaching.

[02:05:45.990] - Speaker 1
How different is that than doing it to a camera?

[02:05:49.710] - Speaker 2
Very different. When I do the solo episodes, it's just Rob in the room. It's only ever been Rob, and when my bulldog was alive, he was there, too.

[02:05:58.290] - Speaker 1
And are you talking to Rob or are you talking to the audience?

[02:06:00.190] - Speaker 2
Talking to the camera. I'm talking to the audience. I'm looking at that little box.

[02:06:03.480] - Speaker 1
And are you picturing anything?

[02:06:05.430] - Speaker 2
So I have about three to five pages of bullet point notes, and then as I'm talking about it, I can think about the next thing I need to see, and I sort of see it in my head. In my mind's eye, I've always had a little bit of a capacity for visual memory. I'm not focused.

[02:06:21.780] - Speaker 1
What's going on is in your head. You're not picturing a person listening.

[02:06:25.350] - Speaker 2
No.

[02:06:25.740] - Speaker 1
You're focusing on what you're saying and making sure the information is correct.

[02:06:29.360] - Speaker 2
Yes. Actually, these days I'm listening to come out. That's what makes me calm. I'm listening to how it's coming out and I'm trying to see if it sounds right for the point I'm trying to make.

[02:06:43.120] - Speaker 1
Sounds right? Meaning makes sense, as clear, as concise.

[02:06:47.320] - Speaker 2
As possible, and where there needs to be an inflection on a particular point or point in a sentence, I'm doing that. I think to imagine that there's an audience out there would just freak me out, because then I'm thinking about how it's going to land.

[02:07:04.150] - Speaker 1
So when you're in front of an audience, is it the same or are you considering the people in the room?

[02:07:10.060] - Speaker 2
I know they're there, so I'm acknowledging their collective presence.

[02:07:15.030] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[02:07:15.360] - Speaker 2
But I'm not thinking about, oh, the guy in the back or the person in the front room.

[02:07:19.450] - Speaker 1
You're still probably doing a similar process of looking in and like, what's the next thing I'm going to say?

[02:07:24.700] - Speaker 2
I come off stage from the lives. Like, the last one we did at the Beacon was, to me, I think, the best of the four we've done, only because I came off stage and I was like, I have no idea what just happened.

[02:07:37.960] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you were just in the zone.

[02:07:39.160] - Speaker 2
I have no idea.

[02:07:40.150] - Speaker 1
It happened.

[02:07:40.820] - Speaker 2
It happened. And I spent the entire day listening to Strummer talk. I have this collection of clips of him and that's what worked. Then, I think I texted you about this and I'm like, I'm not going to use this at the next one. But I kept walking up and down the pier and I remember there's this interview with him where he's like, music is not the point and it's his intention. And when I listen to him, I'm not paying attention to the words. It's like he'll say something, then he'll pull it from the bottom of his gut. He has this, like, breath. It might as well be it's like a tribal leader going and you get it. And so what I was experiencing is, like, I want to just channel that. I mean, I know I make a lot of Strummer, but to me it was like he was really tapped in. Not all the time, I'm guessing, but he was super tapped in. He understood that there's all this stuff that could funnel through him and come out. I really think he got it or I get it from him and I don't do it nearly as well, but I could tell he could pull energy together in some sort of coherent framework.

[02:08:54.260] - Speaker 2
But I think what he was trying to say over and over again is it's not the framework, it's like the message is a felt thing.

[02:09:01.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[02:09:03.070] - Speaker 2
And when I do the lives, it's like what I want people to understand is irrelevant. What I want them to feel is just the beauty and utility of biology and the beauty and utility of ongoing inquiry. Their inquiry, not mine, theirs.

[02:09:24.690] - Speaker 1
Beautiful. You mentioned Wikipedia earlier. How do you verify information if you're doing research, how do you know what to believe?

[02:09:33.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, we talk about Wikipedia, but PubMed Library, Congress, peer reviewed research is my bread and know that's where I've published my whole career. You publish the journals, then the stuff goes there. If there are corrections to those journals, entries or papers are retracted, that's going to show up there. So does it mean that all papers are created equal? No. Is there a lot of lying in papers? Yes. Most of the lying in scientific papers is by omission, where people throw out things that didn't fit, so you never get to see it. It's the unknown that we'll never know. Outright data fabrication is more rare. It does happen now with just happened.

[02:10:18.220] - Speaker 1
Recently, now with Stanford.

[02:10:19.740] - Speaker 2
Yes. Our former president of Stanford who was a neurobiologist, is a neurobiologist, was either left voluntarily or was forced to leave because of issues in prior publications of his. Those were discovered through there's an online site called PubPeer where people who see errors in journal papers or duplications of figures that could only be either human error or intentional are called to attention and then authors have the opportunity to respond. Now, AI is used to forage digital images in all these papers and is finding lots and lots of errors and outright fabrications in different papers. There's a woman are those being shared.

[02:11:07.040] - Speaker 1
Or are those being hidden?

[02:11:08.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah, there's a woman on Twitter named Elizabeth Bick B-I-K who tweets out about some of these and often with the author responses. Sometimes the author responses are absolutely hilarious. Like there was one yesterday where clearly there were a bunch of cells duplicated in a brain tissue slice from a control subject versus Alzheimer's subject. Same cells put to different locations in the two. There's no way the same cells could exist in two different brains. I mean, these are clearly the same cells. And the author's response that she put up was something like we cannot explain why the images show up in both sides. Clearly it's an error. But then they didn't say that they intentionally did it. But you can't imagine any way it could have been unintentional. So sometimes it's just silly responses. Other times it will open up entire investigations. People will lose jobs. More often than not, when there's an error, it's traceable to one author. This is the big debate now. If it's traceable to one author and it's not the head of lab was the head of lab responsible for knowing about it? Sometimes labs are really big. I always ran a relatively small lab.

[02:12:20.270] - Speaker 2
So when labs get really big, it's harder to control everything coming out of there. I tend to trust collections of papers from different laboratories that arrive at the same general sets of conclusions, what I call the center of mass of data because otherwise you're relying on a one off. And having worked in big labs and coming up, I mean, I've got stories and everyone in those labs has stories about people getting the data to please the head of lab. I mean, that's probably the most common problem in science that's not talked about enough, which is if career advancement, like getting a job, going to the pros, getting an income, taking care of your family is dependent on publishing and publishing in high tier journals gets you better jobs and career advancement, well, then the incentives are obvious. And in a lab where there's ten postdocs and research is hard and it doesn't often work, there will be people, not all, but there will be people who will try to figure out what the head of lab wants. Because they know that if they give them that give mommy or daddy that they are going to be the person who's pushed forward and promoted.

[02:13:39.330] - Speaker 2
And that head of lab is going to be on the phone to top universities saying, you got to hire this postdoc of mine. They're amazing. I benefited from working on things very different than my advisors as a graduate student. I also benefited from working for a woman, Barbara Chapman, who said early on, be comfortable publishing papers in not the highest tier journal. So my lab, I'm proud to say and know coming up over the years, yes, we have some papers in Nature and Science, these are the Apex journals, but we also publish papers in Journal of Neuroscience, journal of Comparative Neurology, journals that are considered archival and solid. But they're not the kind of journals that are going to get you promoted. But guess what? Not every discovery we made was worthy of the highest tier journals. So you learn to trust things based on the center of mass. Also, certain laboratories get reputations for being excellent, so you can trust stuff from there better. When it comes to what's out there on the Internet, that's a lot tougher. I still have an affection for kind of OD theories and interesting things because I don't think there are terribly many new ideas.

[02:14:47.680] - Speaker 2
There's better tools that can reveal those ideas in new ways. But look, if we're going to get really just direct about this, I believe that there are certain compounds, not all of which are prescription medication compounds, that are of value for human health. The data on some of these is relatively thin. And yet I know from my own experience and from the experience of others, that a lot of these things are quite safe and quite effective and quite cost efficient. So I talk about some of that on the podcast. I just make it clear what my sources are. I'll say, you know, there was only a couple mouse studies in one human study and there weren't that many subjects, but it's pretty interesting what they saw. And guess what? I tried it and it worked for me. I don't know if it's going to work for you or things like Ashwagandha where it's very controversial. But a big issue is that people take it for high doses for periods of time that are too long. It should be cycled if it's going to be used at high dosages or it shouldn't be used at all.

[02:15:46.720] - Speaker 2
I think there's a lot of individual variability. And the nice thing about the podcast is I have an opportunity to talk about all the caveats, whereas in your typical clinical trial, it's like the export from it is going to be depressed. People should take 20 milligrams of blank and blank. But when you talk to a psychiatrist and they tell you how medication is prescribed. It's like this person comes in menu of symptoms. If they meet eight out of ten of them, they're quote, unquote, depressed. And the psychiatrist is literally told, pick a medication off the list. Doesn't matter which prescribe it. See how it goes. Now, that, to me, is almost pseudo random.

[02:16:28.010] - Speaker 1
Well, it's random, not pseudo.

[02:16:30.100] - Speaker 2
Right? Exactly. And so I think that there's a batch of psychiatrists, paul Conti among them, that believe in medications, but also believe in other approaches and are thinking about this in a far more nuanced way. I think that when it comes to cancer and oncology, this became clear to me when my graduate advisor died of breast cancer at 50, and my postdoc advisor died of pancreatic cancer at roughly 60. And Barris, the second guy told me, he said he took an immunotherapy treatment. He said, this just made it worse. And I said, well, why'd you do? And he said, Well, I had read this clinical trial, and one of our colleagues had suggested it to me. And I'm like, Are you sure you made it worse? He's like, I'm absolutely sure. Now, Ben was a data junkie, and he was absolutely sure then he was doing different diets that helped, but eventually, he succumbed to it. And I remember asking him, because I interviewed him the entire year up until he died. I have it on audio. I haven't released it yet, and this is 2017. So I didn't have a podcast. I just recorded it, because I loved him, and he was my friend, and he was really quirky.

[02:17:37.880] - Speaker 2
But I also loved his irreverence for things. And he said he's like 90% of what we do in medicine now, keep in mind, he's an MD. He's like, is complete and utter nonsense. He's like, It's just sifting deck chairs on the Titanic. And I said, well, what's the solution, Ben? And he's like more research. But also, we just have to know that we're really flying blind in a lot of areas.

[02:18:00.980] - Speaker 1
How difficult is it to get funding for something that would be a breakthrough for mankind, but not profitable?

[02:18:07.790] - Speaker 2
Near impossible. You would need a philanthropist who had no self interest. So philanthropy sounds wonderful. Someone comes along and gives you money. That's old school classic philanthropy. New school philanthropy is, I'll give you money if you give me IP.

[02:18:26.810] - Speaker 1
It's philanthropy to take money. If you get the IP and you can profit from it, that's philanthropy.

[02:18:32.200] - Speaker 2
Today, I will go on record saying this. Most of the philanthropy that you hear about, that's biomedical philanthropy nowadays, there's an IP agreement.

[02:18:42.320] - Speaker 1
It's a profit motive to be down the line.

[02:18:45.610] - Speaker 2
Listen, scientists are so desperate for money, even at the best universities with huge endowments, multiple billions of dollar endowments, scientists are desperate for money. Because when you get money from philanthropy, you don't have to write grants. And writing grants is an enormous time suck. Enormous. Now, it's. Also useful because it helps you vet your ideas. But you write grants to the NIH basically about things you've already done. This is the secret that is not even a secret. In NIH, people apply to do the work they've already done because they have so many stringent requirements for you can.

[02:19:26.490] - Speaker 1
Only meet them if you've already done right.

[02:19:29.100] - Speaker 2
Like there's really adventurous pioneering work that hasn't been done yet, isn't going to get funded. It's just not that's not the way NIH funding goes. What gets funded is what's already been shown to work. And I'm chuckling because every scientist but.

[02:19:43.130] - Speaker 1
So funny, because if it works, then why does it need funding?

[02:19:45.670] - Speaker 2
Exactly. What people should get funding is on the basis of how successful they were the last four years and should be forward thinking. Like, just trust me that with the next four or five years I'll do good stuff. Because the last four or five years I did good stuff. And then if they don't, then you cut them off after that. That would make more sense. Now, philanthropy, someone comes along, let's say somebody gives a laboratory a million dollars a year for a lot of wealthy people, that's not a ton of money. Or you could pool a few together, that's four NIH grants. And you think, okay, that's four NIH grants, great. But that's also four NIH grants. You don't have to write, you don't have to put through the review.

[02:20:20.470] - Speaker 1
And how long is that process? So the NIH review process, oh gosh.

[02:20:23.760] - Speaker 2
It can take eight months per grant, goes through multiple revisions. They only fund the top 8% to 10%. It is a nightmare. And the solution is not to increase the federal budget for research. The solution is to start pulling money from other sources so that people don't have to write more grants. You don't want to fund too many grants because there are a lot of lousy grants also. So philanthropy used to be people giving money. Maybe they want their name on the side of a building, whatever, but scientists then get to do the work. Now, I'll just say this, near all of the major philanthropy that you've heard about, the big press releases, the initiatives and the institutes and whatnot are given with the written understanding contracts that say the IP is shared or the IP belongs to the philanthropist or the company they will found. So it's not pure philanthropy.

[02:21:18.500] - Speaker 1
That's wild.

[02:21:19.410] - Speaker 2
It's wild. They're thinking, I'll give you this money. So they're using the university as a research and development tool, and the university is using their money to survive. Scientists are interested in what they're interested in, and in the end, hopefully there's some useful medication or some useful treatment to come out of it. But if there is no profitability opportunity at all, near zero to zero.

[02:21:43.330] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[02:21:44.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah. There's very little, absolutely pure generosity at the level of money as it relates to science, which is not to say the process is bad, it just doesn't exist.

[02:21:56.300] - Speaker 1
Well, it's just helpful to know that's what it is because we hear a word like philanthropy and we think of it as a selfless act.

[02:22:02.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Like for instance, I know people who've given a lot of money to encourage research on psychedelics, which is allowing laboratories to do work that they would never get funded from the NIH ever. That's allowed them to publish enough things that now the NIH is starting to fund into that. But I will tell you that ten out of ten of those philanthropists all have an intellectual property stake in the outcomes of those studies.

[02:22:28.260] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[02:22:28.640] - Speaker 2
Related to the biotech companies that they are founding to use to get psychedelics out to the world. Very little. Pure philanthropy. Right. Are they bad people? No. Are they self interested and generous?

[02:22:40.650] - Speaker 1
It's really a function of business. I think the word clouds the issue.

[02:22:44.470] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Philanthropy. Yeah. Well it's sort of like I mean it's like the arts too. I mean you hear about these stories like the Medici's were funding and then the art needed to be done in a way that built up their family's reputation. And rich benefactors and philanthropists are exceedingly rare. But you and I both know that rich, and especially the ultra rich, they can get what they want, they can get travel, they can get sex, they can get in the room with whoever they want. What they can't control is what other people say about them. They can suppress, but they can't get people to say nice things about them just because. So giving money is one way in which they build up their reputations. And by the way, this isn't always like a dark situation. Right. Philanthropy has built universities and has built a lot of important programs which was.

[02:23:34.950] - Speaker 1
Good at one point in time, which.

[02:23:36.410] - Speaker 2
Was great, which was absolutely great. But it's clear that ultra wealthy people got that way by being very savvy unless it was just purely inherited. And in many ways they see opportunity that academics don't see. I could never start a company. I have part ownership of Scicom, which houses the Human Lab podcast. But I'm not a business person. Like no way. And so it also makes sense that somebody who's very good at business would think like oh, and once you make these discoveries, then we'll start a business with I. It's a division of labor of sorts. I think that the process of doing science in the US is most hindered, in my opinion, by this independent investigator model. The idea that it's one person whose name is on the lab. I always thought the better idea would be to have the labs be named after a certain, know, the Solving Depression Lab and have five PiS again panels over individuals.

[02:24:39.190] - Speaker 1
Does it happen differently anywhere else in the world?

[02:24:41.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So in the, in the Italian system, typically people finish their postdoc and they don't expect to have their own lab. They'll go work for a research group and those groups are very large and there tends to be one head of lab. But in England it used to be more like that as well. So there are certain places in Europe.

[02:24:58.970] - Speaker 1
And what yields good results, collaborative effort.

[02:25:02.740] - Speaker 2
Where you have a lot of opinions looking at the same data. I mean, even getting back to the data fabrication issue or the data omission issue, if you have three or four well trained people looking at the data, it's going to be a lot harder for mistakes to get through. I think when you have one person leading the charge, inevitably you're going to have some bad apples and it's also just mistakes get through whether or not they're intentional or not. I guess if they're intentional, they're not mistakes. But the point being that when you have small groups of highly trained people doing something, it's just better. And so I think we need to get rid of the independent investigator model. I never liked having my name on my lab. The fact that the podcast is called Huberman Lab, but my lab at Stanford is also called the Huberman Lab, I was never comfortable with that. I never liked it. Thought it should have been like the anxiety, the subject, whatever the subject was. Yeah, I think that we tend to promote the person too much. We make it too much about the person. And look, and after these people die, including me, this will happen to me.

[02:26:04.950] - Speaker 2
Like no one remembers them anyway. Most people either remember the name, like a Richard Feynman, but they can't tell you what he did, or they remember what somebody did, but they can't remember the person who did it. And nowadays, I think trust in big institutions and in experts and in academic science is at an all time low. I think it's like in the low, 20% of people say that they can trust what they see and we hear all these bad examples, but there are also some beautiful examples of people doing incredible work. And I don't say that just to balance it out or for political reasons. I think, look, doing science is beautiful. You don't make much money you're paid in those moments of discovery. And yet as we move toward a better understanding of things like cancer, nutrition, diabetes, mental health, the incentives are going to go up because there's real money to be made. I mean, even like a 1% longer period of stable memory for somebody who has Alzheimer's would be like a multibillion, if not trillion dollar industry. But there's still no effective treatment for Alzheimer's, at least not in pill form.

[02:27:17.050] - Speaker 2
Some people are getting results of the ketogenic diet, but that varies. So it's like wide open.

[02:27:24.000] - Speaker 1
What are you most excited about for the future going forward? For you?

[02:27:28.980] - Speaker 2
For me, I'm very focused on the next podcast I'm interviewing the Surgeon General in a couple of weeks. That'll be great, which is a trip, and I intend to ask him some hard questions, like, how come now we're talking about all this mental health and isolation cris, but during the pandemic, no one was talking about it. I was talking about it because no one else was talking about it. I kept waiting. It didn't happen. Why are we still in the 1985 model of mental health? There's some things that are just baffling to me. I imagine he has some good answers that are based on some really serious practical considerations, but I want to know what those are. I also want to know about what's possible. So I'm excited about the next episode always. I'm excited about what I don't know is going to come. Right? I don't know. I mean, being friends with you has taught me, like, I don't know what's next. I'm focused on trying to do the best job I can. On the Sunscreen episode, I'm excited about the episode we did with Dr. Rena Malik on sexual urologic and reproductive health because finally she gave straight answers for a lot of things.

[02:28:43.740] - Speaker 2
Not everything, but a lot of things. I'm excited about getting information out there, but I'm not thinking, like, what happens after the podcast? I'll podcast it until it doesn't make sense to podcast anymore.

[02:28:54.470] - Speaker 1
What's the first time someone approached you since doing the podcast and let you know they like it's making a difference in their life?

[02:29:02.320] - Speaker 2
I don't remember the first time. I'm always obviously happy when people do that. I don't get a dopamine hit off of it. Look, if I could be anonymous and do the podcast, I would. I know I'm not very extroverted. I love being among close friends, but I think that the most satisfying feedback is when people say, hey, I'm sleeping much better, or I always wanted to quit drinking alcohol, but you gave me a really good excuse. Or, you know what, I heard your episode on alcohol, and I'm not going to pay attention to the advice, but I really appreciate it. I got that a bunch. Or this helped because we have somebody in our family with an eating disorder, or that kind of direct feedback, but maybe the best feedback is just when people say, I can't believe this is free. That feels the most gratifying to me because those years at Embarcadero or like, we were all struggling, and I got to see in those years things and people and get really close to environments that I would have never gotten close to. There's a lot of suffering out there. And one of the things that always bothered me was depending on the pure chance of the parents you're born to and where you live, you either have access to great information or not.

[02:30:20.310] - Speaker 2
And I think that's changed now. And sure, certain things, medical care, et cetera, cost things, but a lot of what I focus on are behavioral tools that are accessible to anybody. And I always say optimization is about optimizing for your environment that you happen to be in. And so the idea that the information can get out to some kid in Malaysia or somebody who has no means whatsoever, but they can do a few things, like viewing morning sunlight and dimming the lights at night, taking a cold shower, there's a reason to save money, turn off the heat, these kinds of things. That's very gratifying. I want to help people. I think trying to do good in the world is important, and the tools to do that should not be the exclusive domain of the wealthy or those that are on a university campus.

[02:31:10.480] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I love that you're sharing what feels like protected information with everyone for free. We all get the benefit of what you're interested in learning about. I just want to thank you for sharing the wisdom.

[02:31:22.870] - Speaker 2
Thanks. I really appreciate that. I'm very gratified by the fact that people seem to like the material and hopefully benefit from it. And just like me talking about fish or God knows what when I was a little kid, I couldn't help myself anyway.

[02:31:37.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's so unique. The fact that it's coming from you with so much heart and soul is felt. I think the reason it connects is much because of the way you feel it as the information itself.

[02:31:51.090] - Speaker 2
Thank you. Well, I definitely feel it from go, like, when I discovered this is how something might work or could work, or does work.

[02:32:01.510] - Speaker 1
It's exciting.

[02:32:02.510] - Speaker 2
It's so exciting. It just is like, wow, how could I not tell everybody? Cool.

[02:32:09.990] - Speaker 1
Well, thanks for doing it.

[02:32:11.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, thanks for having me. You've been a huge influence on my life, by way of example, in the way you've led your career as a writer, a producer, things that I'm not involved in. But the way you approach things is amazing, and your friendship has been amazing. I've grown so much as a person as a consequence. So thank you.

[02:32:48.850] - Speaker 1
Ramatan. Ramatan.
