[00:00:06.680] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammaton.

[00:00:07.080] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton.

[00:00:09.200] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. I used to make movies a lot in the '90s, and I would travel a lot.

[00:00:31.230] - Speaker 1
And I was very lonely, and I felt very unmoored. And I think part of what gave me a feeling of purpose and comfort outside being on a movie set which you never know what days are going to work or not work. And so you can end up being alone in a hotel or in an apartment for a long time, is that I would try to crack a city because I love food. I love art. My dad was a painting major at Tulane, and then he went into TV, and he instilled this obsessive love for fine art and food. I got a lot from my dad. So I remember I was really young and I was doing this movie in Paris that wasn't very good. And I didn't have a lot of money. And the concierge gave me some recommendations of where to eat and what to see. And they were really terrible and expensive. And I wasted my small paycheck, and I was really upset. I thought, this is terrible. Clearly, this guy is getting a kick I came back from somewhere. How does one find the cool stuff? How do you find the great vintage store?

[00:01:53.390] - Speaker 1
This is obviously way pre-Internet. How do you find the best rotisserie chicken place in Paris? How do you do that? So during my time off, I would walk around Paris with a notebook and discover and find things and keep notebooks full of notes. If I saw a really cool-looking girl somewhere, I would stop her on the street and say, Where do you have coffee? And where do you shop? And I just started keeping notes. And that's where this idea of curation or making things from the point of view of getting right to the best of the best and saving everybody time, saving myself time. That's where at first, I referenced those books all the time when I started to put the site together. It compounded because because of my movie career, I was able to buy a house before my friends and renovate. And so I became the Oracle of info for people my age just because I was a little bit ahead of schedule. I thought, I should aggregate. I'm so lucky. I get to meet this designer, and she tells me about this cool fixtures place in the village, East Village. I got to aggregate all this stuff so that I can put it there for everybody to find.

[00:03:22.640] - Speaker 1
I had to learn how to make food and all the things. Over time, It just coalesced into this idea.

[00:03:33.930] - Speaker 2
So it started as a resource for yourself?

[00:03:36.270] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:03:37.290] - Speaker 2
And then became- And my friends. And became a resource for everyone else? Yes. When you went back to Paris after that first time of keeping a notebook, would you refer to the notebook and know all the places to go?

[00:03:47.390] - Speaker 1
Oh, completely. And then I would expand on it and find new places. I still spend an inordinate amount of time researching places to eat in Paris and wherever else.

[00:03:59.920] - Speaker 2
What are some of the early cities that you went to and what were the experiences in each? And how were they all different?

[00:04:07.740] - Speaker 1
They were where I was shooting movies. Paris, Toronto, Venice, Naples. Also, I had been an exchange student in Spain and spent a lot of time in Madrid, and I kept returning to Madrid. I never shot a movie in Madrid. I think what was interesting to me is how different the tenor of each city was, how different the cultures were. Even though Spain and Italy, the languages are relatively similar and they're in relatively close proximity. It's how different. And so my experiences would be so markedly different. In Madrid, there is... I always say there's no such thing as cool in Spain. There's no velvet rope that you have to stand behind. There's no we're cooler than you. There's no indie culture in that way. So Spain was this incredibly warm, vibrant experience, very all-encompassing and very friendly. London, of course, where I live forever, that's the capital of cool. It's very reserved, lots of velvet ropes, and also quite a solitary military place in its way, incredibly different from... And I always think the further north you go, the more reserved people are, and the further south, the more open. So I've had a really interesting life of living in different places and traveling to different places.

[00:05:50.850] - Speaker 1
It's funny. I never felt quite at home in the UK, but I did so many films there. I lived there. I got married and had kids there. I lived there for a really long time. I was always trying to crack it in a way. I don't know that I ever did. I never felt quite like it was fully at the same frequency as I was.

[00:06:17.700] - Speaker 2
Were there any places that you spent in Europe where you feel like I could live here?

[00:06:21.460] - Speaker 1
For sure, Italy and for sure, Spain.

[00:06:24.930] - Speaker 2
You'd find information, you'd say, mainly by talking to locals? Is that the secret?

[00:06:29.130] - Speaker 1
That's the secret. I mean, well, now, of course, there's the internet, so there's a million ways to find everything. But still, I still ask people. If I see someone where I'm like, Oh, she looks cool. I would want to be her friend if I lived here, then I'll just get my notebook out.

[00:06:48.330] - Speaker 2
Would you say, Where did you get those shoes?

[00:06:50.770] - Speaker 1
Yes, totally. I start with more broad. I'd love to know your version of the city. Where do you go? What do you do? Give me your routine. Then I will drill down into details.

[00:07:05.940] - Speaker 2
Did you end up becoming friends with any of these people?

[00:07:08.120] - Speaker 1
No. It was very transactional.

[00:07:10.680] - Speaker 2
That's interesting because it does seem like an opportunity to create a whole web of just interesting people.

[00:07:15.770] - Speaker 1
It's true, except I was always so transient when I was filming.

[00:07:21.100] - Speaker 2
Typically, how long would you be in a city for?

[00:07:22.620] - Speaker 1
Really depend. I guess anywhere from a day. I was in Naples for a day or two days. And of course, getting all the pizza and gelato places I could find up to London, years and years. I probably did nine or 10 movies in London.

[00:07:39.460] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the transition from the notebooks to deciding to make it public.

[00:07:47.640] - Speaker 1
So that was many years because then the Internet was born, of course. And then I would be on the Internet trying to find some version of that. And It just didn't exist. And so I thought, Oh, I think I should... I would like to do this. And I knew, of course, that people would be reactive to it. Being in the public eye is such a strange thing. And I think people really... They like to discover you and then keep you just as they found you. And And so it's hard when you evolve into something else or you change the idea. It's really like famous people get projected on for good or bad. The people who like you get comfortable seeing you as who they like to see you as, right? And I think especially for women, it's hard. People like you how they like you. And I knew that it would be people People would be like, What the hell is she doing? So it took me, which they did, by the way. So it took me a long time. First, I was ideating, what would this be? And then I thought, Oh, it'll just be a website, and I can have categories and different information.

[00:09:16.610] - Speaker 1
But then I did what I always do, which is go to speak to a lot of people who are much smarter than me and have domain expertise. And they said, You shouldn't do that because if it's a website, then people are going to expect it to update all the Because at the time it was just media, it was news sites. And I said, well, it's just me with WordPress, so I'm definitely not going to be updating this thing every two minutes. And then do you know Peter Arnell? I don't. He was this advertising legend in New York. So I was talking to him. He actually named the company Goop.

[00:09:54.720] - Speaker 2
Great name.

[00:09:55.330] - Speaker 1
Thank you. I thought it was really weird at first, but it's ground on me. And he said, Why don't you make it a newsletter that you send out once a week? And that way, that's the event. And then the website can be just where they're all archived. So we built that. We built that, we got everything in place. I think I announced somewhere that there was a signup, and I got many, many thousands of signups.

[00:10:24.540] - Speaker 2
This was before you sent out the first email? Yes. You got signups?

[00:10:29.580] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think I'm wondering how I would have done it in those days because there wasn't even Instagram yet. But maybe I, who knows, spoke to People magazine or something and said... And this is before blogs. This This was a long time ago. What year did it start? 2008. So I gathered all the email addresses, and I had decided to categorize everything. So there would be a food, travel, wellness, style, and culture. And every week, I would choose a category and send out some content. And the first was my favorite recipes, a couple of them that I made at home, literally shot on my Blackberry, the lowest quality. I looked back and it was so earnest and so sincere and so homespun. I'm like, What? It seems insane now when I look back that I did it.

[00:11:38.520] - Speaker 2
Maybe that's the reason it worked, though. Maybe it's like in a world of everything being a big corporate statement, making something personal that you care about speaks to people.

[00:11:52.540] - Speaker 1
Maybe. I guess so. I think what's really right about what you're saying is that there's always been a deep authenticity there. When I started, I didn't monetize it for years and years. Sometimes I'd be like, Why am I doing this? I'm pouring all my own money into this thing. But I felt like it was really important to me, and I really loved doing it, and I love connecting people to something that will be positively impactful them.

[00:12:30.150] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get to talk to people who used the site or who read the newsletters? Did you get emails, comments?

[00:12:36.360] - Speaker 1
Yes, because I would get feedback.

[00:12:38.270] - Speaker 2
What were the things that people would say?

[00:12:41.530] - Speaker 1
I think people were really, in the early days, very charmed by it, and they really, really liked it a lot. I would hear things like, Everybody waits for Thursday in our office for the newsletter to come out. So nice. We all want to know where you've been and what you've eaten and what's cool and what's coming around the corner. So it was nice once you filter out the, I'm going to eat your liver once.

[00:13:12.400] - Speaker 2
Would you say it had a diary-like feel in the beginning?

[00:13:15.740] - Speaker 1
Yes, very much so. Very much so. It was very from the heart. I guess it could be introspective at times, but then it was also from my a diary. I ate here. I made this. That content coming from my life.

[00:13:35.550] - Speaker 2
Did you keep a diary, typically?

[00:13:38.220] - Speaker 1
No. When I was younger, I used to keep a diary religiously, and then somebody betrayed me and read my diary, and I never kept one again, which is a shame, I think, because I would have really loved to have that record. Now that basically I'm senile, I would love to know.

[00:14:01.520] - Speaker 2
Do you remember your dreams?

[00:14:04.760] - Speaker 1
I do.

[00:14:05.760] - Speaker 2
Do you ever write those down? No.

[00:14:07.800] - Speaker 1
Should I? It's up to you. Do you?

[00:14:10.130] - Speaker 2
I've done it. I've gone phases where I keep a dream journal.

[00:14:14.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think dreams are so interesting, and I'm always never that happy in dreams. So I don't know. It's never a place of a bouliance and joy. It's like it always feels a little weird and indecypher The good thing about the dream journal is that when you look at it in the moment, you write down the dream and it doesn't make any sense.

[00:14:37.990] - Speaker 2
But years later, if you look back on it, it all makes sense. It's like, Oh, it's so clear. But we're too close because it's coming from our subconscious. The categories were travel. Travel was always a key, and it sounds like that was the initial spark.

[00:14:54.160] - Speaker 1
It was, absolutely.

[00:14:55.810] - Speaker 2
Then food?

[00:14:57.460] - Speaker 1
Yeah, where I was eating or what I was making.

[00:15:00.200] - Speaker 2
And then wellness? Yes. When did you get into wellness?

[00:15:05.380] - Speaker 1
Really early. Basically, my dad, who until he died, was the love of my life. He was diagnosed with cancer when he was 54, which is so fucked up because I'm 52. And now I'm like, at the time, he seemed like this old man. And now I'm like, this is crazy. It's so young. Anyway, he went through do horrible things. The radiation that he had burned his throat and burned away his salivary glands. He had a very hard time eating. And while he was having the radiation, and stop me if this is too gory, he had a feeding tube, and I used to push the inshore or whatever out of a can high protein nutritional drink directly into his stomach. No shade to ensure whatever the brand was. One day, I was doing it, and I turned it over and I read the ingredients, and I was like, What is in this?

[00:16:13.300] - Speaker 2
It's like what's in baby formula No, it's not good stuff.

[00:16:16.910] - Speaker 1
I couldn't pronounce or recognize one ingredient. I looked at this man who was suffering, and I thought, Is there possibly a correlation between... Can we be maybe thinking about this in a different way? It was like a light bulb went off, and that's when I started researching all the way back to Hippocrates, who's allegedly said, Let food be thy medicine. Let medicine be thy food. Started to understand this idea that we really are what we eat and that so many of our health issues, our chronic health issues in the Western world, are due to what we're eating. At the time, this was a totally radical idea. I went on this deep dive, and then I started to read about genetically modified gluten and how many gluten per parts we have in our wheat as opposed to the EU and glyphosate and all the things. I tried to present him with all of this information, like when he went to get a PET scan and they gave him a glass of sugar water to drink before because it lights up all the cancer cells and makes him really happy and energized. I'm like, Well, maybe we shouldn't have sugar then.

[00:17:36.440] - Speaker 1
He was like, I'd rather die than not have. I would make him gluten-free food, and he hated it. But I felt really galvanized to try to heal him and to try to figure it out. So that put me on this very crazy journey of researching environmental and the gut-brain access, which at the time, I remember we wrote about it one time and everyone flipped out. It was really early to start talking about this stuff. And it's funny now.

[00:18:14.610] - Speaker 2
A lot of stuff It's all mainstream now.

[00:18:16.250] - Speaker 1
Fully mainstream. Yeah. Like, fully, fully mainstream, which is hilarious.

[00:18:25.530] - Speaker 2
How would you approach the style piece?

[00:18:29.280] - Speaker 1
The style piece Well, that piece was like, I'm such a girl like that. And I'm somebody who really like to express themselves through clothing. And obviously, we make an impression on people when we see them and we're the architects of that impression, right? It's like you have this fabulous gray beard and it's so incredible and your muscles and your tan. You're telling me a lot right now, right? For me, clothing was always the way that I felt like I could express myself. Even in high school, with wearing all the Madonna bracelets and mixing that with a really preppy, upper-side vibe. That was my thing. I loved clothes, I loved accessories.

[00:19:24.270] - Speaker 2
You viewed it as a form of self-expression? Mm-hmm.

[00:19:27.540] - Speaker 1
Some people don't at all. Some people don't even about what they wear, which must be a relief. That piece was talking about great stores or things we had found.

[00:19:42.350] - Speaker 2
Would they typically be small boutiques and Out of the way type things? Yes.

[00:19:47.540] - Speaker 1
Always like a treasure. We were always trying to unearth a treasure for people. Something special.

[00:19:53.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and something that only someone who lived in a place and had cool taste would know about.

[00:20:00.260] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:20:00.740] - Speaker 2
That's great. And then culture, what was that piece?

[00:20:05.170] - Speaker 1
So that was what events are going on around the world, what's opening at the Met, what Museum shows, concerts, those type of things. Exactly, those types of things.

[00:20:19.360] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:20:20.090] - Speaker 1
And also books. There's a culture. Is there a great book?

[00:20:24.640] - Speaker 2
What are your reading habits like?

[00:20:27.370] - Speaker 1
My reading habits are When I'm on vacation, I'll burn through novel after novel. I love novels more than non-conviction, though I do love books like your book. I love books that are reflective and books that help you understand something about yourself or the human experience. I do like that. I find that with novels as well, or all art, it helps me understand my feelings It's my place in the world. It's my inspiration.

[00:21:03.620] - Speaker 2
Would there any references or inspirations in starting of anything that anyone was doing, anything like it?

[00:21:14.570] - Speaker 1
I mean, not really. It had, I guess, elements of a magazine in a certain way, but there was nothing in the digital space that I found was analogous to what I was doing.

[00:21:34.790] - Speaker 2
What was the first product available, the first group product? Or were there any products that you sold that were not group products first?

[00:21:44.270] - Speaker 1
Yes. It started So now I was five years into this thing or something like that.

[00:21:50.840] - Speaker 2
And how many readers would you have at that time?

[00:21:52.790] - Speaker 1
Probably like a million. It's quite a few. And I thought, This is taking up a lot of time. And also people started to come up to me and say, What are you going to do with this thing? There's something here. And I think I felt like I always loved business. I was always fascinated by business. I grew up in New York City amongst the kids of the Titans of business. And when I was a really little kid, I was in LA, where it was artists and showbiz people. And then we moved to New York, and it was this whole other paradigm of success.

[00:22:38.110] - Speaker 2
How old were you when you moved to New York?

[00:22:39.490] - Speaker 1
We moved permanently in New York when I was 11. And I was like, Wow, this is It seemed so unfamiliar and so aspirational. And one of my best friends, his dad was one of the partners in KKR. And my friend Ali's dad ran Bear Stearns. And it was like that, very finance and very intriguing and very elegant. I remember Mr. Kravis of one of the Ks, always being so beautifully dressed, impeccable. And when we went there, we were expected to dress. It was This Witt Stillman thing was true. There was this very amazing aspirational environment in New York. I remember reading Barbarians at the Gate and starting to read the business section. I was just fascinated by it. And I remember being on set, I would always read the business section first, and people would be making fun of me. But of course, I didn't finish college. I only went to college for a year at UC Santa Barbara, which was amazing. But I also was being pulled to start acting. And I had a great education in high school, a superb education. And really, I went to an all-girls school in New York. They really taught us how to think, how to critically think, how to synthesize information, how to follow curiosity.

[00:24:05.800] - Speaker 1
They set me up very well. But still, I didn't finish college. I didn't go to business school. And I certainly did not think I had the authority to start a business or to turn it into a business. And I had no idea the journey that it would send me on. But I remember a woman who actually stopped me at a cocktail party in New York, who's become one of my best friends, only 17 years later, saying, What are you going to do with this thing? It's great, and there's so much engagement. I said, I have secret desires of turning it into something, but I don't even know how to start. And I don't know if I have the guts to do it. And she said, you should go talk to my friend Seb Bishop, who was the CEO of Red, Bono's thing. And he's from the e-commerce world, and he's ready to, I think, do something different. I went and met him and I brought him lunch in his office. I made him lunch and brought it. And he became my first CEO. And we sat down and thought about how to monetize this thing.

[00:25:15.410] - Speaker 2
At that time, was it still the newsletter or had it become the website? Or was the website always just a reflection of the emails?

[00:25:25.730] - Speaker 1
It was up until that point, just housing the emails. So it was just email.

[00:25:31.410] - Speaker 2
The email was the main- That was it. The main way to communicate.

[00:25:34.880] - Speaker 1
That was the whole kit and caboodle. And then I worried about how to monetize and isn't transaction horrible in and of itself? And then a really interesting thing happened to me, which was I did a piece on the French pharmacy, all the great stuff you buy at a French pharmacy. And a woman stopped me on the street and she said, Oh, my Oh, my God. I love that article on the French pharmacy. It transported me to Paris, and I wish I could have just clicked to buy your edit. I was like, there we go. So we started to build an e-commerce.

[00:26:17.670] - Speaker 2
Isn't that interesting how it came from, you're looking for a way to solve this problem. You know you have something valuable. You want to figure out how to monetize it. Someone tells you what they want. It's amazing. It's like how the universe supports these beautiful endeavors.

[00:26:37.660] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's true. It is true. Yeah, she unlocks something for me. We also were doing some brand partnership. A brand would call and say, Can we integrate product in a shoot? If you're doing a fashion thing.

[00:26:51.860] - Speaker 2
Give me an example of how that works. I don't know what that is.

[00:26:54.450] - Speaker 1
For example, we did a big integration with J. Crew, where we did a collaboration with them with certain pieces, and then we shot it. It was a collaboration, but it was paid. It was great because it helped subsidize. By that time, we were hiring teams. I also was really very strict on who could advertise on the platform or not.

[00:27:23.250] - Speaker 2
Stuff that you liked or used.

[00:27:24.750] - Speaker 1
Correct. Only stuff that I liked or used. I felt that it was really important to maintain that integrity, that it was okay to accept a brand partnership, but it had to be something good.

[00:27:37.480] - Speaker 2
It's really an extension of if you're recommending to people where you think it's a good place to eat or what's a great store to go to, to say, This is a great product that I use.

[00:27:50.520] - Speaker 1
It's the same thing. It's about curation. It's about offering a point of view. I think also I had established a lot of trust, which Which was the secret sauce because it was so unmonetized for so long and because it just came from a place of me wanting to share and connect, I had built a lot of trust with the audience. And I still think I have that to this day, and I never, ever would want to do anything to jeopardize that.

[00:28:19.550] - Speaker 2
In the early days, was there a point where you decided, I'm going to stop acting?

[00:28:29.120] - Speaker 1
Basically, yeah.

[00:28:30.530] - Speaker 2
And was that related to Goop?

[00:28:32.930] - Speaker 1
I mean, that was percolating while I was still doing movies, right? Yeah.

[00:28:36.110] - Speaker 2
But would you say it was more like a hobby?

[00:28:39.460] - Speaker 1
It was more like a... Yes, it was because basically the sequence of events was I was doing movie after movie after movie and some amazing films that I'm so proud of to this day, some really lame films. That's just the Nature of the Beast. But I was working relentlessly and breathlessly. And one year, I did five movies in one year. I mean, just crazy. And I don't think I was protecting my brand enough. And I think I was trying to fill a bit of a hole that some of us artists have, or maybe everybody has, where it's like you want to achieve something both internally and externally, and then you think it's to make you- You think that external success is going to make you feel better, and it doesn't work that way.

[00:29:35.620] - Speaker 2
No, I'm not seeing if it works. We learned it doesn't work that way. Yeah, exactly.

[00:29:39.930] - Speaker 1
Then I got pregnant with my daughter. And I basically did... The last movie that I starred in, meaning I was in every scene of the film, was when I was pregnant with Apple, who will be 21 in two weeks. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So I had her and I looked into her eyes and it was like my whole world reoriented in the most profound way. And I was like, I just want to be here. I just want to do this. And luckily, I could afford to.

[00:30:23.750] - Speaker 2
So parenthood really changed everything. Changed everything.

[00:30:27.550] - Speaker 1
Everything. And I just I thought, I'm burn out. I'm absolutely in love with this child, and I'm just going to take a break. So I stopped for three years. I had my son in that time as well. And I was so fulfilled. I still am so fulfilled by it and them. It's so astonishing. It was like my reason for being was made so clear. And then I did supporting things here and there. And I think some things like the first Ironman that we did, for example, was really fun because Robert's an old friend of mine and John Favreau was. And it was treated like an independent film. Nobody thought it was going to turn into anything. And I was in LA, I was staying with my mom. I could work like two days a week. And it was a gentle re-entry, basically. But I haven't done a lot a whole lot of filming. I did a film, actually, this past fall because my kids all went to college. So, yeah, I made a big, big pivot, like a huge shift.

[00:31:44.140] - Speaker 2
The way you're describing it, it had more to do with parenthood than it did with changing to a new career.

[00:31:52.730] - Speaker 1
Yes, definitely.

[00:31:53.790] - Speaker 2
The new career happened- That's right. Simultaneously, but it wasn't, I'm leaving acting creative for a group.

[00:32:00.820] - Speaker 1
No, it wasn't. It was, I'm leaving acting to be home with these kids. And then all of that creative force that wasn't going to the usual channel wanted to be expressed in some other way. And I think maybe with more autonomy and agency. It's like I could just put something into the world as silly as a newsletter or a recipe. Whereas when you're acting, you really need to wait to get a job or to say yes to the right thing.

[00:32:34.290] - Speaker 2
You're dependent on a lot of other things happening. Exactly. In this case, you were free and you could do what you want and you could share what you want. That's right.

[00:32:43.190] - Speaker 1
I found it liberating and empowering in a weird way.

[00:32:51.280] - Speaker 2
You had the meeting with Seb. Tell me about that meeting and what was discussed in the meeting and what you came up with.

[00:33:00.400] - Speaker 1
I was like, Look, I would like to turn this into a business. I have no idea how to do it. He said, I think I can help you figure it out. We're going to need to spend a lot of time and talk about what you are thinking and where you'd want it to be. He said, The natural thing would be that media model of ads and brand partnership. We started with that because it was low-hanging fruit. Then we talked about what we wanted the e-commerce to look like and how it could be something cool and unique. We started with collaborations and selling things that we just really loved and believed in.

[00:33:46.500] - Speaker 2
You remember what some of those things were?

[00:33:48.810] - Speaker 1
I remember there was a T-shirt collaboration. There was this beautiful little lapis box that we did. It wasn't only clothing? No. There was bracelet that we did. It was like one special thing every week. Every week? Every week. It would sell out.

[00:34:11.250] - Speaker 2
Things tended to be limited edition.

[00:34:13.690] - Speaker 1
Limited, yes.

[00:34:14.790] - Speaker 2
That's cool.

[00:34:15.890] - Speaker 1
That's how we started.

[00:34:17.080] - Speaker 2
Then what was the first Goup branded product?

[00:34:22.590] - Speaker 1
The first Goup branded product was our beauty product because, again, going back to my dad and-The ingredients. The ingredients. I started to realize that it's so interesting, too, because I'm still dealing with the repercussions of putting all this toxic stuff on my body for all these years. But Pre-goop. Yeah, pre-goop. Before we made anything, there was very little clean beauty on the market. I think we really helped start that discussion.

[00:35:00.010] - Speaker 2
I read something about nail polish being wildly toxic.

[00:35:03.810] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's terrible. It's wildly toxic. So it's fabric softener. So it's synthetic fragrance. I mean, all these things that we don't even think about that we're not protected from litter.

[00:35:13.330] - Speaker 2
Laundry detergent, everything.

[00:35:14.910] - Speaker 1
Right. Endocrine disrupting. I was researching, again, for the site. We need to get great- And also for you.

[00:35:24.990] - Speaker 2
It sounds like it was- For me, of course. It really was always your own quest. Right.

[00:35:30.370] - Speaker 1
It was like, I identified a white space. There's no clean beauty that's beautiful and that works. You could go to a health food store and get something. Or literally, the top moisturizers had ethylene glycogen call, which is anti-freeze in them. I was like, I want to make this for me and for my friends. We started with skincare because also it felt really urgent to me. We transdermally absorb up to 80% of what we put on our skin. We just suck it right in. It felt like we deserve better. Just women people deserve to have a choice that's efficacious and that's non-toxic.

[00:36:13.660] - Speaker 2
How was the reaction to the beauty line?

[00:36:16.320] - Speaker 1
It was good. I think that was something that wasn't too hard for people to understand. I think, again, because it came out of a lot of content of us talking about this thing, it felt very intuitive.

[00:36:32.140] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get attacked by the people who make the toxic stuff?

[00:36:36.780] - Speaker 1
All the time. They're very clever how they do it, too. It's funny. I have this one group chat, and there are a lot of young moms on it, and they're rightfully incredibly concerned about various things. I'm like the elder statesman on this group chat. One of the moms was saying, Oh, Oh, this blogger said that there's tons of lead in this product and we shouldn't buy it. I said, That might be the case, and it might not be. It might be that the big incumbent is funding this blogger and so that she will say negative things about this product or a movement. I definitely was the recipient of a lot of that. I can't prove it, but I know I was.

[00:37:28.860] - Speaker 2
The non-taxis non-toxic stuff for children, like non-toxic parenting, did that come into a group at some point?

[00:37:36.110] - Speaker 1
Yes. We've never made children's products, specifically.

[00:37:40.940] - Speaker 2
But would you do articles about it?

[00:37:42.470] - Speaker 1
Oh, we did tons of articles about it. Absolutely. Again, I had this personal experience where Apple was a baby and someone had given me something and it was so fragrant. I was like, What is this? What am I rubbing on her?

[00:37:57.980] - Speaker 2
It burns your eyes. Yeah.

[00:37:59.680] - Speaker 1
A A lot of the content came out of that as well.

[00:38:02.320] - Speaker 2
After the beauty line, what was next?

[00:38:04.820] - Speaker 1
Fashion. I think that was in 2016 or '17, something like that we started.

[00:38:10.890] - Speaker 2
Would you work in collaboration with brands or would you do your own branded stuff?

[00:38:14.860] - Speaker 1
No, this was our own label that we started that's all made in Italy.

[00:38:20.470] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that whole adventure. How do you... Meeting the people, meeting the manufacturers in Italy.

[00:38:25.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah. This is the part of my job that is so fun to this I love making things, and again, I'm making things for myself. I also felt that there wasn't a lot of by way of designer quality that was more in a contemporary price point. And the direct to consumer model really allows for you to pass on the savings to your customer. So I remember, again, I was at a store in Hollywood, a really expensive, beautiful clothing store. And I tried on a Blazer or a designer. I was like, this is beautiful. And it was thousands and thousands of dollars. And I was like, this is crazy. I'm not spending $6,000 on a blazer. And then when I went to start doing the discovery and the research, like the factories in Italy, they're making all of the designer clothing, and they can also make your clothing, but you just can decide not to 6X the price or whatever. And we work with this great factory in Italy that we've worked with the whole time. And the way that I approach it is clothes that really are beautifully made, that are cool, but are not overtly trendy.

[00:39:46.740] - Speaker 1
You have them forever. It's like our- Timeless designs. Timeless designs. I still wear almost everything from back when we started. That's my take on sustainability. You buy it, it lasts, and you don't throw it away.

[00:40:04.160] - Speaker 2
If it's too flashy, you can't wear it all the time. It could be your daily- Exactly. Your daily clothing.

[00:40:11.650] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:40:13.710] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the direct consumer model? How did that work? How did it come about?

[00:40:18.780] - Speaker 1
I think when you think about ways to sell product, you're starting a line, and you think about, what are the ways in which I want to distribute this? So when we started, everything was direct to consumer, meaning everything came through our own channel, so our own website and our own stores. And it was also at that time where direct to consumer started to become this big thing. And you have these companies that had big valuations because everybody was into this idea that you have these great margins and you can protect them. And then, Over time, it's been more challenging because the way that you acquire a customer in a digital direct to consumer model is really meta. There's so-A lot of competition for those spaces. Exactly. Our skincare was direct to consumer for a while, and then in order to grow it and also to... I really wanted to meet the customer where they were. Our customer is on Amazon. Our customer is at Nordstrom or Sephora. We opened wholesale channels.

[00:41:35.380] - Speaker 2
For everything or just certain products?

[00:41:37.060] - Speaker 1
Just our beauty. Our fashion is still just direct. You can only get our fashion at goop. Com.

[00:41:43.060] - Speaker 2
Were there any pieces in the fashion line from the beginning that never changed? They're just forever? Or is it always changing every season?

[00:41:51.690] - Speaker 1
It's always changing. It's a strong DNA, but it's always changing and evolving. A new version. Yeah.

[00:41:58.490] - Speaker 2
Overall, in the group, you universe, what things do you do in-house and what things do you farm out?

[00:42:05.180] - Speaker 1
We do everything in-house. We don't farm anything out. We do it all. I always joke that I have friends who were like, Great, I want to co-found a business. And they just were able to become a co-founder. And Adlyn, the moron who, brick by brick, was going, finding a and sourcing raw materials and all the things. But I like doing it all in-house. I think for me and for Goop, I think it's very important that everything we make has a reason. It's incredibly authentic. It's filling a white space in some way and that it's of the highest possible quality and offer it at a price that's not insane.

[00:42:56.830] - Speaker 2
What was the Goup Lab?

[00:42:59.510] - Speaker 1
The Goup The Goop Lab was a Netflix show that we did two seasons of a Netflix show. The first one was called The Goop Lab, and the second one was called Sex, Love, and Goop. The Goop Lab was about these different healing modalities. One was about psychedelics for healing PTSD. This was a long time ago before it was in the conversation. One was on psychic mediums, which is fascinating. It was like going across the catalog of different cutting edge ways that people feel, heal or can feel more connected, et cetera.

[00:43:41.960] - Speaker 2
Sounds great.

[00:43:43.150] - Speaker 1
It was. It was good.

[00:43:44.740] - Speaker 2
What would you say were some of the biggest breakthrough moments in goop?

[00:43:50.700] - Speaker 1
Wow. I remember when we first... Well, our first e-commerce platform was this thing called Magento, which we got off of. We were on Shopify for a while. Then we got off of Shopify. Now we're going back on Shopify. The joys of being a non-technical founder. I remember when we were on the Shopify app, it has this feature where it'll go like, like a cash register and you can see orders come in. I was like, I can't believe we built something. Now orders are coming in on the phone. I felt like it was this huge moment.

[00:44:31.340] - Speaker 2
It's also interesting when you have a virtual business to be able to see in real-time it reacting, because if you had a store, you would see all the people in the store. I know. But when it's virtual, it's hard to know anything. It's true.

[00:44:45.660] - Speaker 1
You get that real-time feedback. That's exciting. Yeah, it was really exciting. It was really cool.

[00:44:51.830] - Speaker 2
Tell me something that you were excited about to do with Goup, but for whatever reason, it just didn't work.

[00:44:57.660] - Speaker 1
Oh, my gosh. There's a lot. I mean, There are certain products or product lines that we did that we had these great vitamins, for example. I worked with these a different MD for each one.

[00:45:11.810] - Speaker 2
So supplements.

[00:45:12.770] - Speaker 1
Supplements, yeah. They came in packs and they were to address certain issues. We had one for fatigue. It was called Why Am I So Fucking Tired? It was this fantastic vitamin pack.

[00:45:28.420] - Speaker 2
They were vitamins that you would take yourself?

[00:45:30.800] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. I made in the best triple certified manufacturers, et cetera. One was called high school genes for metabolism. I've had this incredible experience of learning and failing and learning and succeeding on the job. When we made the supplements, I didn't know to build enough margin in so that we could advertise them and put some marketing behind So they were never really profitable, and it just became too difficult, even though they were great. And when we discontinued them, people were very upset. But I would say things like that, where, like wellness products, when we did them, I didn't understand the margin profile and how to do it. So that was hard. It's always hard when you sunset a product. It's like we did these bath soaks, and now we only have one that remains. But you have to. That's part of You always have to be doing a reconciliation of your SKUs, of the other brands that we work with that are on the site. In a business like mine, I cannot be only creative-minded. I will run out of money and not be able to pay people. There's always this balance of-The realities of the business have to be paid attention to.

[00:46:54.960] - Speaker 1
Right. They have to be profitable and they have to work and there has to be product-market fit. I could make product all day that I would love and buy, but it might not work and it might not be a sustainable thing.

[00:47:09.680] - Speaker 2
When did the idea come to have the first store, physical store?

[00:47:15.100] - Speaker 1
So it must have been... Well, I moved to LA from London in 2013 and repatriated the company here. It was tiny, and hired a couple of girls, and we worked... I had this little barn in the back of my house in Brentwood, and we worked in there. And I had one of my first employees. She actually was with me in London, and she moved to LA with me. Her name was Brit, and I'm still close with her. I love her. She was full of creative fire, and she was a great partner for me. And she was always helping me find chic things and always had great marketing ideas. And She said to me, Oh, there's a space in the Brentwood Country Mart, and we could do a pop-up there. I was like, That is fantastic. Let's do it. We quickly threw together this pop-up, and we were getting inventory from God knows where, but scouring the Earth to get great stuff in there.

[00:48:23.970] - Speaker 2
It was curated stuff as well as your own products?

[00:48:26.790] - Speaker 1
I think at that time, we didn't have our own yet.

[00:48:29.060] - Speaker 2
Oh, so it was all curated?

[00:48:30.410] - Speaker 1
It was all curated. Great. We opened it up, and it was a huge success. I know it was awesome. We sold out of everything. Then the landlord there, Jim, was like, Do you guys want to open a permanent store here? And so we did. And for a while, we did this pop-up model where we would go around the country and do these pop-up stores, which was great and so much fun. And then little by little, we would make some permanent stores. And then during COVID, we closed a couple. And now we're opening more again.

[00:49:11.350] - Speaker 2
What is Goop Kitchen?

[00:49:13.270] - Speaker 1
Oh. My first newsletter was about food. And again, like going back to the Let Food Be Thy Medicine, this is a physical manifestation of that. And my unrelent wanting desire to make things easy for people, like to get right to the good thing as quickly as possible. We started a... It's cloud kitchens only, so it's delivery and pickup only.

[00:49:43.760] - Speaker 2
So it's not a restaurant It's not a restaurant. Delivery or pickup.

[00:49:48.830] - Speaker 1
That's right. Only.

[00:49:50.950] - Speaker 2
And do you subscribe or do you order a meal and get that meal?

[00:49:55.770] - Speaker 1
You just order a meal on DoorDash or Uber Eats or whatever.

[00:50:00.470] - Speaker 2
How many places does it exist now?

[00:50:02.620] - Speaker 1
Now we're up to seven.

[00:50:04.450] - Speaker 2
It's a lot.

[00:50:05.150] - Speaker 1
In LA. We are doing Northern California this year, and then we'll go to New York City in 2026.

[00:50:14.180] - Speaker 2
When did it When did it start?

[00:50:15.970] - Speaker 1
It started five years ago. That's when we started talking about it. Then I'm trying to remember when the first one opened, probably three years ago. It's really fun because it's that intersection of totally delicious food, really bold flavors, but super clean.

[00:50:36.520] - Speaker 2
How do you find the healthy ingredients?

[00:50:41.110] - Speaker 1
Where do you source them? The team who works on that business is incredible, and they know that it's quality above everything. And so they have their supply chain, and they work directly with farmers. And we get beautiful things. We get beautiful salmon from New Zealand. We have the best possible chicken that you can have and no seed oils, and there's no gluten at all, and no corn. And the best part is that it's so good. You would never know that it's quote-unquote healthy.

[00:51:17.080] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the home you grew up in.

[00:51:19.980] - Speaker 1
I grew up here in Southern California when I was very little. My parents had me when they lived in Trankis, so not too far from where we are right now.

[00:51:29.950] - Speaker 2
Do you remember that life at Trankis at all?

[00:51:32.920] - Speaker 1
Not really. I remember being a little bit older and coming out to Trankus to visit their friends, but I was a baby baby when we were there. And then we moved to Brentwood and then to Santa Monica. And it was a childhood full of a lot of art. And my father was hilarious and very loving. My mother had this incredible artistry and warm femininity. We were around a lot of actors, and it was anchored in a lot of troupe spirit of your band of players. We went to Williamstown. Every summer, my mother would do the Williamstown Theater Festival, so we would go there. My brother and I went to camp in Vermont, and we had a lot of exposure to creativity.

[00:52:30.670] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your relationship with your brother.

[00:52:33.030] - Speaker 1
My brother is my best friend. Aside from my husband, I just rely on my brother. So my brother is incredibly brilliant and very wise. He's three years younger than me, but I call him for basically... I mean, everything. Sometimes we call, we just kibbitz on the phone for an hour, but he's very Very wise, and we're very, very close.

[00:53:03.850] - Speaker 2
Tell me your memories of seeing your mom on stage.

[00:53:08.270] - Speaker 1
Oh, my gosh. She was so incredible. I think that's why I wanted to act, because my mother on stage was so powerful and so fulfilled and channeling something from the heavens. She is the best theater actress. It's actually crazy. So inspiring, so moving. It's funny because in life, I think she seems to feel less integrated in life, but on stage She's this fully integrated powerhouse.

[00:53:49.060] - Speaker 2
So cool.

[00:53:49.870] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[00:53:50.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Do you ever talk to her about after a show? Would you talk about it, or was it just such a normal part of life that it went unset?

[00:54:01.190] - Speaker 1
I remember talking about it. I remember I was a teenager, and she played Blanche Dubois in a street car named Desire in Williamstown with Chris Walken as Stanley and Sigourne Weaver as the sister. It was incredible.

[00:54:17.600] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:54:18.740] - Speaker 1
My mother gave the most brilliant performance. At the end, Blanche Dubois really comes apart at the scenes. I don't think there's ever been a better performance ever in the world than my mother doing that play at Williamstown. I was devastated. After it, I couldn't get out of my chair. I sobbed for hours. I remember asking her a little bit about that and what it was like and how she did that. But a lot of times it was just normal. I remember also later, when I was a teenager in New York City, she would do a play and she would come home at night and come up to my room and we would hang out because I'd be doing homework at 11: 00 at night or whatever. So I have a lot of fond memories of her tied to the theater.

[00:55:07.330] - Speaker 2
Was there ever a time that you were watching her in a play and you forgot that it was mom and she became the character?

[00:55:16.390] - Speaker 1
All the time.

[00:55:18.070] - Speaker 2
Isn't that amazing? All the time. In acting work, have you ever been in a scene where it's so real, you forget it's a movie?

[00:55:31.230] - Speaker 1
It's hard to explain, but there are these moments that happen where you're so in something that... It's not that you totally forget that you're in a movie, but you're connected to this other energy of pure... I don't know. It's almost like you're transported to some other place where there's an inner change. Maybe it's like this in music. I bet it is.

[00:56:04.090] - Speaker 2
Where you're- You feel like it's actually happening.

[00:56:06.610] - Speaker 1
You feel like it is happening. It is happening. It's happening. You have the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and you're in this incredible moment. And those moments, I think, are few and far between, but they're indalible.

[00:56:20.710] - Speaker 2
Are you ever surprised by a choice that a fellow actor makes? When you're playing against them and they do something unexpected.

[00:56:30.070] - Speaker 1
I love when that happens, and it's very rare. Robert Downey Jr. Surprises me all the time. Whenever we do anything, I'm like, okay. It's almost like he's the pitcher and you have no idea what he's going to throw, and you just have to be there with the bat and be as tuned in as you possibly can be. I love when actors do weird, unexpected things.

[00:56:56.790] - Speaker 2
How much of the work is listening?

[00:57:01.970] - Speaker 1
Like, 90%.

[00:57:05.180] - Speaker 2
How much of a performance is in the words you're saying?

[00:57:11.660] - Speaker 1
It's interesting because sometimes, If you're doing a great work of art, if you're doing a Shakespeare play or a checkoff play, the words are the wind in your sails. Sometimes you're doing something that's less remarkable, but it's still giving you a good framework and you're working with good people and still magic can happen. So I guess it would depend on the material, really.

[00:57:46.630] - Speaker 2
So sometimes great things can happen if the material is not great. But when the material is really great, it does the work, would you say?

[00:57:56.480] - Speaker 1
Yes, it does the work. I mean, great material always does the work.

[00:58:00.410] - Speaker 2
How did you learn your craft?

[00:58:02.580] - Speaker 1
Watching my mom. Yeah. From the time I was born, being on set with her, watching her rehearse plays. She played Nina and the Seagal, and she said I knew her whole monolog at 18 months old, like really early.

[00:58:23.720] - Speaker 2
Yes, you were born into it.

[00:58:24.720] - Speaker 1
I was born into it.

[00:58:25.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Did your mom have any good habits that you've adopted?

[00:58:31.860] - Speaker 1
Yes. My mother always struggled with learning her lines, so she would go over them. I would read them with her. She would have them on a tape Really knowing your lines, that's key because you can't play around. If you're searching- If you're distracted with it.

[00:58:53.690] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:58:54.170] - Speaker 1
She really taught me how to let it the stage be the conduit between heaven and Earth. She taught me how to ground on the stage such that the body could be a conduit.

[00:59:13.080] - Speaker 2
That's amazing. I've never heard anyone talk about that before. I've seen musicians channel, but I've never heard anyone in theater talk about that.

[00:59:23.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah, she taught me that.

[00:59:25.300] - Speaker 2
That's great. Have you ever done theater?

[00:59:27.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:59:28.000] - Speaker 2
And what's the first time you performed in front of an audience?

[00:59:30.930] - Speaker 1
When I was little, because in Williamstown, they would throw me on the stage to play Dead Kid number 5 or something like that.

[00:59:38.000] - Speaker 2
Were you excited when you got to do it or was it scary?

[00:59:40.130] - Speaker 1
Yes, I loved it. I loved it. I always wanted to be an actress from the time I was little. Then I did plays in school, and then I went back to Williamstown and was an apprentice when I was probably 17 and got an audition for a little part, and that was my first real-professional acting gig. Yes.

[01:00:00.060] - Speaker 2
What was it like playing in front of an audience that you remember with the feeling?

[01:00:05.360] - Speaker 1
Intoxicating. I think being on stage is a very specific and special thing and so different to being on camera and very energizing. It's really the actor's medium, right? It's like that's when you are in control. In film, it's very much not the case.

[01:00:30.130] - Speaker 2
It's the director's medium.

[01:00:32.140] - Speaker 1
Film is the director's medium, and TV is the writer's medium. Yeah.

[01:00:36.090] - Speaker 2
What was it like going to an all-girls school?

[01:00:38.650] - Speaker 1
The best. When I got there in seventh grade, I was so out of my league. I had gone to this hippie, sweet school in Santa Monica, where I still have best friends from, which is so hilarious.

[01:00:56.740] - Speaker 2
What was that life like?

[01:00:58.500] - Speaker 1
It was called St. Augustine the Sea, and then it became Crossroads because Paul Cummins, he was the head of both, and then he combined them. So I must have started kindergarten in 1976. And Santa Monica was cool. It was in the '70s and the early '80s, it was this bleached-out stained glass, like ocean-y, briny, free life. It was amazing.

[01:01:35.570] - Speaker 2
It was like discarded in some ways.

[01:01:39.150] - Speaker 1
Yes, totally. It felt like no one was there.

[01:01:43.260] - Speaker 2
There was like this- I remember the first time I came to Santa Monica to go to a bookstore, and it was on the Third Street promenade. And the whole Third Street promenade was boarded up, and there was this one cool bookstore, an art bookstore.

[01:01:53.660] - Speaker 1
Wow. Yeah. It was vacant.

[01:01:56.870] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It seemed like it had time in the past, but now it's no more.

[01:02:04.260] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's right. And we had this great childhood. There were some ups and downs, of course, but in terms of I really loved my friends, and I loved being in California. But then we would travel a lot because my mom, she would do a Broadway play, and we'd all pack up and go, which I love, too. Or we went to South Carolina She did the Great Santini, and we all went, and we would enroll in public school in Bufert, and we would live there. So there was a bit of a gipsy thing to it. But I didn't learn very much at my elementary school by way of spelling or arithmetic, the basic things. So I don't know how I got into Spence, the school that I went to. I have no idea. I think it was because, going back to reading, I had read novels early, and I remember talking about them in my interview, and I remember the look on the lady's face like, wow, this 11-year-old kid's already read Jane Eyre and whatever else. I think that's why, because I'm sure my test would have been just terrible. I got to Spence. I was totally out of my league.

[01:03:19.410] - Speaker 2
What were the other kids like?

[01:03:21.240] - Speaker 1
They were New York girls. They were fast-Sophisticated? Sophisticated. Even in seventh grade, they They knew what was what, and they were incredibly independent. So I learned to hop on three subways to get to my best friend Julia's house in the village. I learned. I got mugged. I would go to the steps of the Met, and the boys would skateboard, and we would go at night and smoke cigarettes. It was a much different world than LA. And the girls were brilliant, really smart. And it was this super steep learning curve. I had to learn how to learn how to write, how to spell. It took me two years to catch up, which was hard on my self-esteem. But I got there.

[01:04:16.080] - Speaker 2
Did you feel a need to catch up?

[01:04:19.480] - Speaker 1
Yes. I'm much better since I turned 40, and then way better since I turned 50. But I used to be very susceptible to people's opinions and expectations.

[01:04:30.850] - Speaker 2
Would you say it was more peer pressure or competitive nature?

[01:04:35.500] - Speaker 1
It was more like lack of self-esteem. The weird thing about me is I'm probably the least competitive person you'll ever meet. I just don't care. I don't look to the side. It doesn't bother me what anybody else is doing. I'm here on Earth to do my thing and all my trials and tribulations, and so is everybody else, and it's nothing to do with me. But I am susceptible to feeling Especially then less than or- Did you want to fit in? I wanted to fit in. The cool thing about my school is that being intellectual was cool. I had to get on it.

[01:05:18.300] - Speaker 2
Tell me about living in Spain when you were young.

[01:05:21.480] - Speaker 1
It was incredible. How old were you? I was 15.

[01:05:24.610] - Speaker 2
You were there by yourself?

[01:05:25.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I signed up in my Spanish class, and I remember my dad bringing me to the TWA terminal.

[01:05:33.380] - Speaker 2
You flew there yourself? Yeah.

[01:05:35.890] - Speaker 1
I got to Madrid. I got on a bus. I went to this tiny town, and my Spanish mother picked me up off the bus.

[01:05:44.550] - Speaker 2
Did you speak Spanish already when you got there?

[01:05:46.250] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:05:47.160] - Speaker 2
Did anyone speak English when you got there? No. Wow. That's radical.

[01:05:52.070] - Speaker 1
It was insane. I probably spoke Spanish 10 days later because there was literally no other choice.

[01:05:58.730] - Speaker 2
Otherwise, you wouldn't have I had food. That's right.

[01:06:01.660] - Speaker 1
It was really one of the most special experiences of my life to this day. It changed me. It made me understand the scope of the world and how different people are in different cultures and foods and how when you learn another language, you get given another life. It's like a whole other framework and culture and meaning and I'm still very close to my Spanish family. In fact, my Spanish father walked me down the aisle when I married Brad.

[01:06:38.780] - Speaker 2
Beautiful. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. You've had close relationships with some strong, successful, artistic men over the course of your life. Would you say there's a quality that runs through all of them that you can recognize? I think I've always been attracted to artists.

[01:07:03.390] - Speaker 1
I think there's something very beautiful about a male artist, that they're like a shoeing or turning on its head the idea of what masculinity is supposed to be because creativity is such an archetypal of the feminine. It's collaborative and creative and channeling and mysterious. My dad was an artist. He was so tough in his own way, this tough Brooklyn Jewish Long Island guy. But he had this incredible softness and creativity. I love that. I love the balance of masculine and feminine qualities. That men who are unafraid to have vulnerability in their work. It's so beautiful.

[01:08:02.810] - Speaker 2
How was your parents' relationship?

[01:08:06.780] - Speaker 1
I mean, they were married for 32 years until my dad died, and they were very entwined with one another. I think they were... My dad absolutely worshiped my mother. She was like the Shicza Goddess on a pedestal. And he took great care of her and was so respectful of her career and her art and just in awe of her. She was just madly in love with him. He took care of her and provided this great structure to their life. He's very social and she's very introverted.

[01:08:50.570] - Speaker 2
Did they balance each other in that way? I think they did.

[01:08:53.460] - Speaker 1
He got her out, out of her shell and having fun. I think she got him a bit more internal and introspective and I think they were a good balance.

[01:09:02.270] - Speaker 2
How has the experience of working with different directors different? Tell me extremes of how it works with one person versus another.

[01:09:13.760] - Speaker 1
The best directors, and it can be subjective in the sense that people like certain films or not, but I think, generally, by my standard, the best directors and the world tends to validate, are those who have this hyper-specificity about the world they're creating and what they want. I've done so many movies where it's like you're day three on the movie and you're like, This is going to suck. This guy doesn't really-Not a vision for the big picture?

[01:09:51.440] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:09:52.140] - Speaker 1
There's no vision. He doesn't really know what he's looking for here, or he thinks he does, but he's missing the mark. You're like, great, now I'm going to be in the... That's at the low end. At the absolute highest end, you have someone like a Wes, our friend Wes, who it's like, I always liken it to stepping into a painting. It's like there's something so relaxing about being in good hands like that.

[01:10:23.340] - Speaker 2
With Wes Anderson, there probably aren't a lot of choices to make because he sees it so clearly Really. Yep.

[01:10:32.280] - Speaker 1
Zero choices.

[01:10:33.440] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's just this is how it goes.

[01:10:36.510] - Speaker 1
This is how it goes. Yeah. For me- Hitchcock was like that, too.

[01:10:40.280] - Speaker 2
Yes. Very specific, even though different films. Very specific. Even though different films, but that idea of having a worldview that they're presenting.

[01:10:48.290] - Speaker 1
Yes. Paul Thomas Anderson is like that. David Fincher is like that. It's funny, right? Because you could say that to me. There's not a lot of choices to make, and that could sound constricting, but actually it's so freeing because you feel the scaffolding around you of the specificity of the director's vision and brain. Then you're freed up to just find your character and be and find your inspiration. You're not worried about like, Oh, God, am I going to have egg on my face here because this guy doesn't really know what he's doing?

[01:11:24.940] - Speaker 2
Have you worked with any great directors who are more improvisational in what they like?

[01:11:30.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I did a movie once with Alan Rudolf, who was of the Robert Altman School. I did a movie with him, a great bunch of people in Montreal about Dorothy Parker. I just had a small part, but it was like Jennifer Jason Lee and Campbell Scott. It's where I met John Favreau. Alan was very improvisational, so that was different and fun. Then Iron Man 1, we improvised almost the whole movie. Every day, we would just improv, which was unusual for a big budget film.

[01:12:05.480] - Speaker 2
How has success been different than you might have imagined it?

[01:12:12.520] - Speaker 1
I think that we all have this idea that if we're ever successful, we will feel whole, we will feel home, we will feel embraced by some universal reversal spirit. It's just not what happens. It's quite complicated. Of course, it's wonderful to have success and to have your dreams come true. It's incredible. But If you haven't worked on the fundamental things, which a lot of times are driving the need for success, then it's not going to be necessarily what you thought.

[01:12:55.630] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your spiritual life.

[01:12:57.720] - Speaker 1
I'm a meditator. When did you learn? I learned in probably 2009, and I had very sporadic periods of being very religious about it and then not.

[01:13:12.260] - Speaker 2
How did you come to it?

[01:13:13.790] - Speaker 1
I had done yoga for a very long time, which is really a meditative practice, and there's meditations at the end. In Shivasana at the end of yoga, I would often go to a very deeply connected place, deep into parasympathetic and feel that wonderful God connectedness. I was talking to somebody about that, and I had been doing yoga less, and I can't remember who suggested that I meet my meditation teacher, Bob Roth. Do you know him?

[01:13:45.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah, he's a friend.

[01:13:46.450] - Speaker 1
He came and taught me how to meditate.

[01:13:50.620] - Speaker 2
Tm.

[01:13:51.190] - Speaker 1
Tm. I actually use lots of different meditation techniques. I love TM in the morning, and then I do a lot of breathing breathing and a lot of nervous system, quick meditations. Also, open-eye meditation I do sometimes. I think when I can get into my parasympathetic, that's really critical for me because my life is a bit frantic And nature is a big part of my spirituality, too, even though it sounds weird. But just being in grass or in the woods or in a body of water. My best friend Mary always says, reorganizes the molecules.

[01:14:32.160] - Speaker 2
Tell me something you believe now that you didn't believe when you were young.

[01:14:38.500] - Speaker 1
I think that healing is possible. I don't think I believed that when I was young.

[01:14:44.780] - Speaker 2
Do you I think you didn't believe it when you were young because of things you saw?

[01:14:47.830] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think I weirdly have more faith in people now.

[01:14:55.130] - Speaker 2
For many people, it's the opposite. I know. Many people, as they grow older, have less faith. That's interesting.

[01:15:01.370] - Speaker 1
I know. I think I have consciously make my circle smaller just because I have so little time, but I actually have more faith in more people.

[01:15:14.270] - Speaker 2
Anything that you can think of that you don't believe now that you used to believe when you were a kid?

[01:15:20.180] - Speaker 1
That you can escape the axioms of your life.

[01:15:27.120] - Speaker 2
And have you managed to do that to some degree?

[01:15:30.420] - Speaker 1
I think you never can escape the axioms. All the way. No. I think when you're little, you think, One day I'll grow up and this pain will wash away and the places in which I'm broken will be healed. It actually doesn't happen. But if you are able to, you learn tools with which you can use those things to make your life make all of the important things come out of those broken places and actually see them as an asset. But they're always with you.

[01:16:09.180] - Speaker 2
Without them, you wouldn't be who you are. That's right. So you'd say self-acceptance. Is that a part of it?

[01:16:14.930] - Speaker 1
I think really being incredibly honest with yourself about who you actually are.

[01:16:22.890] - Speaker 2
What is your favorite restaurant in the whole world?

[01:16:25.140] - Speaker 1
Rick. This is so hard. Well, I could go so many ways with this.

[01:16:33.580] - Speaker 2
This is today's answer.

[01:16:35.480] - Speaker 1
This is today's answer.

[01:16:37.670] - Speaker 2
That's always today's answer. Anything you say is like…

[01:16:40.790] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[01:16:41.520] - Speaker 2
Maybe it's a different one.

[01:16:42.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but meaning, for example, there's a restaurant in New York that I grew up going to every Sunday night called Elio's, and I just love it so much. But is it like a Michelin star? No, it's like…

[01:16:59.610] - Speaker 2
No, but it's your favorite.

[01:17:00.750] - Speaker 1
I think it's my favorite. Okay.

[01:17:02.540] - Speaker 2
Or if you could transport yourself anywhere in the world to have dinner tonight, where would you choose? Paris. What restaurant? What would be the restaurant?

[01:17:10.000] - Speaker 1
I think I would go to this newish place that I love called La Renommée.

[01:17:16.670] - Speaker 2
Delicious. What food is it?

[01:17:19.280] - Speaker 1
It's French, but it's got a great cheeseburger as well.

[01:17:26.720] - Speaker 2
Most beautiful place you've ever been on the planet?

[01:17:31.220] - Speaker 1
I think when you ask me that, I have this memory of being in Thailand at this really amazing hotel. You can do this thing where you take a boat down a river to this incredible little restaurant. I remember being in this boat and going down this river, and it was wordless at sunset. It was the most beautiful place I think I'd ever... I still, to this day, when I think of that, I have chills.

[01:18:05.750] - Speaker 2
That sounds great.

[01:18:06.750] - Speaker 1
Incredible.

[01:18:08.340] - Speaker 2
How do you think you're most misunderstood?

[01:18:12.190] - Speaker 1
Let me count the ways. I think for people who don't know me or haven't interacted with me or maybe haven't listened to me on a podcast, I think I'm misunderstood. I think I've been in the public eye for a long time. I think people think I was raised in a particular way, like I was raised in privilege and that I'm living a rarefied air, and it's just not who I am.
