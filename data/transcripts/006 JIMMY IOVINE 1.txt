RR:  Jimmy IOVINE

(Time:  0:00)

JI:	Hello, Rick!

MV:	(male voice) What’s happening, man.

JI:	Nice to see you, man, how are you?  So nice to see you.

RR:	It’s been a hundred years, I think.

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It has been, it has been.  I think maybe the last time I saw you was in a picture with each other.  With Eminem.

RR:	Was that the last time?  Maybe at your house.

JI:	Maybe, maybe.

RR:	Great coat.

JI:	Oh thanks. 

RR:	It’s a beautiful mix.

JI:	It’s that guy that passed away.  (Virgil)?

RR:	Really?

JI:	Yeah, the wife brought it for me.

RR:	Great.

(Now on microphone; previous conversation was in background.)

JI:	My wife does have good taste.  What is that?

RR:	Oh that’s the thing I wanted to show you later, just a reference.

JI:	Let me tell you something, man.  I have  . . . it’s so weird, maybe it was the inspiration for me calling, but I have not . . . when I get into a thing with music, I just don’t stop.  This fucking Johnny Cash shit.  I mean Danny Boy?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  I would have never thought of that.  You know when you hear something . . . even today, I’m retired all this shit.

RR:	Pull it closer to you.  Pull it closer.  Just a bit.  You know, you’re an engineer, you know where the mic goes.  

JI:	Man, I wish I thought of that.  You know what I mean?

RR:	I didn’t think of that, Johnny thought of that.  Johnny thought of Danny Boy.

JI:	No, I’m talking about Johnny Cash.  

RR:	Oh, about Johnny.  

JI:	I wish I’d thought of that.  You know, it’s like . . .

RR:	It didn’t happen in a normal way.  I’ll tell you the story if you want to hear it.  

JI:	Yeah, I do.

RR:	I was not thinking about Johnny Cash.  It was more of an experiment because I was a kid at the time.  I produced a bunch of records fast, but only maybe doing it for years or something like that.  Not a long time.

JI:	What year was it?

RR:	I don’t know.  80 . . . probably a few years after I met you.  I was thinking about when we first met, which was unbelievable to me.  I was still in college when we met.  We first met in Paul Schindler’s office.

JI:	Fuck!

RR:	37 years ago and you may have been the first professional record producer I ever met.  

JI:	He represented you?  

RR:	Yeah.

JI:	Fuck!

RR:	And I remember the conversation we had because it was a strange conversation.

JI:	Oh really.  (laughs)

RR:	I had just produced my first rock album by a band called The Cult.  A band from England.  I produced that album and I was excited just because I never did that before.  I already made some hip hop singles.  I don’t even know if I had any albums yet.  Just single hip hop stuff.  And I played you a song and I remember you said ‘I wish I could still do something that simple.’  Like it was so rudimentary, because I didn’t know anything.  I just recorded the band.  You know, I didn’t do anything.  

JI:	It’s so funny you say that because when you get to a certain point in producing records, I found, you stop making the first albums and, even if you make their first album, you produce it like it’s their third.  It’s just the innocence and the ignorance.

RR:	And how powerful that ignorance and innocence is!  It’s so . . . 

JI:	Yes, yes, and you end up . . . you have too much information.  You have too much.  You enter the studio and it’s somebody’s first album and you have too much information.  You’re not all in the same place.  Right?

RR:	Yeah, no it’s fascinating.  

JI:	I would have heard that and said, gee I wish I could just stop.  

RR:	That’s what it was like.  It was like . . . and it didn’t make sense to me because you’re a professional, I’m a kid in school, I make this record not knowing anything, and your reaction was ‘yeah, I wish I could do it like that.’  It’s like I’m sure you’ve done it like that, what do you mean?  It didn’t compute, but it’s fascinating.  

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it’s true though.  I’ve always thought of that.  I think about that now in my life.  Where I just . . . Bob Seeger had the best line ever.  I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then.

RR:	Wow, that’s a great line.  That says it all.

JI:	Isn’t that a great line?

RR:	Yeah.

JI:	I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then.

RR:	Did you ever work with Seeger?

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

RR:	I had no idea.  Tell me about it.

JI:	Yeah, well I got caught in a period of time where I came out here.  I came out to L.A. with Tom Petty . . . I came out first with John Lennon in 1973 and then I went to New York.  I lived in New York, so I worked at the Record Plan on Bruce and Patty Smith, and a few things like that.  Then I came out in ’79 to do Damn the Torpedoes with Tom.  And it worked and . . . which we’ll get into, I rolled into Stevie Nicks, right?  Damn the Torpedoes came out, her label heard it, they liked it, she loved Tom Petty, all of it came together and so I went in with her.  And that was cool.  Then, all of a sudden, I became a California record producer.  You know what I mean?  Which was like . . .

RR:	Did you have to decide to move out here or was it obvious once you’re here, you’re gonna stay.

JI:	Yeah, no once Tom was here . . . well I moved out here I think for the same reason most New Yorkers move and English move out here is the weather.  You know, I came out here in 1973 and I just called my mother and I said how’d you get this wrong.  This is where we . . . you know.

RR:	Just the quality of life.

JI:	It’s just . . . it was fucking December and it was like 75 degrees and I’m like holy shit.  I asked the guy at the Beverly Hills Hotel because John put me up at this really ritzy hotel.  I said, you have docks here?  Because my dad was a longshoreman, right?  I said you have docks here?  He goes I got docks, we got docks here.  It’s the biggest port in America.  I said wow, so I call my mom, I said how’d you get it wrong?  

(Rick laughs)

JI:	What the fuck.  I said do regular people live here?  You know the kind of question.  

RR:	Yeah, do regular people live here.  

JI:	You know what I’m talking about.  

RR:	Of course.

JI:	So I said do regular people live here and he goes absolutely, I’m a regular person.  I live here.

(both laugh)

JI:	I mean you just ask the dumbest questions.

RR:	Because you had a fantasy of California from seeing it on TV.  That’s all we knew, was like . . .

JI:	When I was 17, we were programmed to only like The Stones and The Beatles, and not the Beach Boys because they were from California.  You know what I mean?  

RR:	That’s interesting.

JI:	So we had one guy on our street . . . I come from an Italian neighborhood, named Carl Stuyvesant.  He had a Beach Boys album, but he also was the only guy on the street with blond hair.  Because he wasn’t Italian.  

RR:	I see, I see.

JI:	Right?

RR:	I see, so Italians didn’t like the Beach Boys.  

JI:	We liked New York.  We liked The Stones and The Beatles and Vanilla Fudge.

RR:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Vanilla Fudge was incredible.  

JI:	And Leslie Western Mountain.  You know that’s the kind of shit we liked.

RR:	Was doo wop already done?

JI:	For me.  Doo Wop . . . my life started Ed Sullivan The Beatles.  Ground zero.

RR:	Do you remember seeing it on TV?

JI:	I remember sitting on my mother’s blue shag carpet, right in front of the RCA TV.

RR:	How old were you probably?

JI:	I’ll tell you exactly how old I was.  I was . . . it was a month or six weeks before my 11th birthday.  

RR:	Wow.

JI:	It was ’63, right?

RR:	Yeah, I think so.

JI:	’63 or ’64.  If it was ’64 . . .

RR:	So either way, 11 or 12 years old.  

JI:	Yeah, 10 or 11.

RR:	10 or 11.  Okay.  A little kid, you see this and it just blows your mind?  

JI:	And I beg for a guitar from the day after that.  No, no, it more than blew our minds.  It shocked … I was in grade school and I remember going to Catholic school with nuns.  I remember we all tried to comb our hair forward, right?  And I remember . . . I was a good kid in school, I would never look for trouble.  So we all did that and the nuns said ‘you too, Jimmy?  James?’  I said yeah, I’m a Beatles fan, you know what I mean.

RR:	Was it, again, hard to know, I can’t put myself there because I was later than you.  But when you saw it, what was so different about that then what had come before.

JI:	Well it was a shock of all things at once.  First of all, it was a band playing the songs.

RR:	Yeah, like Elvis had a backup band.  He wasn’t a musician, he was a singer.

JI:	These guys were singing, there was four of them and three of them were singing and all they all these haircuts, and it was like how’d this land here?  What is this?  This was like nothing I’ve ever seen, and then you hear the hype before, Murray the K, they’re coming, they’re coming, they’re screaming, the girls are screaming, then you see on the news the Beatles land at Shea Stadium.  The frenzy was insane.  And I remember seeing it and just my mind exploded.  And any friends of mine that are in music, including Springsteen, he talks about it all the time, he was older than me because he’s like four years older than, 3 years older than me, so he must have been 14.  But it was . . . by the way, I’ve been around a lot shit since then, nothing ever felt like that.  

(0 hours, 10 minutes)

RR:	And it was all organic.  There was no like big machine push behind it.  

JI:	No.

RR:	It was sort of out of the blue, it just happened. 

JI:	Yeah, they had trouble getting a record deal as you know.  It just … but when they landed on Ed Sullivan, man, they landed.  The world changed at that moment.  It really was.  Remember it was right after the Kennedy assassination, which was very fresh in our minds, so it must have been ’64 because Kennedy got killed in ’63.  So in ’64 I was 11 going on . . . no, 10 going on 11.  So yeah, it was . . .

RR:	It changed everything and then you got a guitar.

JI:	Kennedy had just gotten killed, which was big, which was as big as that.  

RR:	Did everyone love Kennedy?

JI:	Yeah, well my neighborhood.  You know what I mean.

RR:	He was young, first time young President, seemed cool.

JI:	Yeah, he was the first President I paid attention to in my life, right?  So you know, and he was young, they had him and the wife, they were handsome; the little kids.  It was something that didn’t look . . . you know before him was Eisenhower.  A general, like a soldier; who relates to that, right?  And then when he got killed, I remember being at school.  So those two things happened at once.  

RR:	Where’d you go to school?

JI:	Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

RR:	In Brooklyn?

JI:	Yeah, everything was in Brooklyn.

(laughter)

RR:	Yeah, your whole world was in Brooklyn.

JI:	You know, there was . . . Manhattan was the Land of Oz.  It was like every now and then you got to go there.  Like if your parents took you or you went . . . not until I was 16 did I ever go to Manhattan for something of my own; 17 years old.

RR:	And what were the kids like?  Tell me the world.  Tell me what the world was like then.

JI:	My world?  100% Italian.  It was right by the Battery Tunnel in Brooklyn.

RR:	Were most of the kids’ parents like first generation?

JI:	Yeah, some of the parents . . . well those were . . . there was grandparents Italian, there were parents Italian, and then there were Italian kids that came over, right?

RR:	Yeah, oh cool.

JI:	So it was very, very . . . even in that I was siloed.  The people from Calabria, people from Naples, they were different.  My family was from Ischia and everybody kind of stayed together you know, but they mixed somewhat.  

RR:	More than with anyone else, but not as much as with their own.  

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, with their own.  You know, like my grandmother would always say ‘of course he’s Calabrese.’  Of course, he’s stubborn, you know what I mean.  But we all spent time together, but it was a really very, very Italian, fish hanging in the fish stores, church and Catholic, and few Irish spread around here and there.  Right next to the projects in Red Hook.  We were Red Hook when I was little, but then when I was 16 it became Tower Gardens.  You know where that pizza place is, it’s Lucali’s, right?

RR:	Yes.

JI:	So I grew up one block from Lucali’s.  Yeah.  So it was real, real Italian, you know.  So everything I knew was . . 

RR:	Did anyone speak Italian or no?

JI:	We wouldn’t speak Italian because if your grandmother tried to talk you, the whole thing was about being American.  

RR:	Everybody wanted to be American.

JI:	Absolutely.  If you spoke Italian . . . because even the kids that came over from Italy, they didn’t hang out with the American Italians, they hung out in the espresso shop.  And the Italians hung out in the candy store.  It was very, very, very different.  It was like that.  It was very, very . . . for example, my grandfather made wine in the basement.  I lived with my grandparents and my mother, right?  He used to want to give us wine for dinner, like at 13.  I would say nope, Pepsi.  

RR:	Because you were American.

JI:	Because Brooklyn’s Pepsi.  Brooklyn is Pepsi.  It was the mob and they had the distribution and all that stuff, right?

RR:	Was the presence of the mob . . .

JI:	Oh my God, yeah; oh my God absolutely.  It was the (Zagalar) gang there.  Remember, this is the 60’s.

RR:	And were people afraid of them.  Tell me, what was the vibe.

JI:	Well you knew.  You walked around very casually like people do in their own neighborhoods in any rough neighborhood, but you knew.  And you know who was a tough guy and who wasn’t.  You knew who was connected.

RR:	And they weren’t really looking for trouble.  You would have to be an asshole to have a problem.  

JI:	Yeah, in my neighborhood.  But, I didn’t own a business or anything like that, but I’m sure there was stuff going on, you know what I mean?  And you just don’t fuck with them.  You know what I mean?  It was that kind of thing.  But my dad knew some of the guys and stuff like that, and my best friend’s uncle, actually his backyard was connected to mine.  He was one of the Gallo guys.  Yeah, it was right there.  It was very, very much right there.  

RR:	At this time when you’re a kid, are there jukeboxes?  Was that the thing of the culture?

JI:	Absolutely.  In the candy store.  My aunt was the candy . . . Lil & Dots.  It was her candy store.  We used to all go in there; little, little candy store.  You’d fit 30 people, squeezed in and you’d play music and eat candy.  Soda and things like that, but it was a candy store.  

RR:	And what would be on the jukebox.  Give me an example of the playlist.

JI:	Again, you had the older kids which was my sister, so they had ‘Do You Wanna Dance.’  They had the Contours and they had doo wop, but they also had rock and roll, Elvis, right?  And then they had in our generation, we had The Rascals and Vanilla Fudge and I remember when The Doors’ first single came out and that sounded incredible on the jukebox, right?  I remember Hendrix’s first record came out, I heard that on the jukebox.  Everything was singles.  And then the albums started.  The album took off . . . we had albums in our family of Frank Sinatra . . . First of all, that’s all you hear is Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  

RR:	Not bad!  I mean, nothing wrong with that.

JI:	No, no, no, but that’s what’s going on all the time.  It’s always . . .

RR:	If you came to my house, that’s pretty much what you’d get now.  (laughing)

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah; Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, but Frank was really, really big and Dean Martin.  

RR:	And they were still young.  

JI:	Yeah, oh yeah.  It was ’65, ’66, right?  You know, and all the neighborhood . . . there’d be a group of guys that would go to everybody’s house for a drink on Christmas Eve.  So it’s generational.  We all hung out in the same place, but it was all generational.  There were the little kids, the big guys, and the parents.  Like my father’s club was right next door to my candy store and my father’s club was a social club.  

RR:	And the candy store was essentially your social club.

JI:	Yeah, exactly.  And my sister’s, but different times.  We very rarely went at the same time.  It was a different generation.  She was 7 years older than me, still is.  So you know, it was that kind of environment, man.  It was nice.  Talk about what made Sammy run, I couldn’t wait to get the fuck out of there, you know what I mean?  Because . . .

RR:	Push the bottom of metal towards me.  The bottom.

JI:	Bottom of the medal towards you.  There you go!  

RR:	There it is.  (laughs)

JI:	So that’s what it was like.  It was very, very Italian, everything was Italian.  Midnight mass, you know, church, school uniforms and everybody talked like Brooklyn Italians.  You know what I mean?  The real Saturday Night Fever or Goodfellas, everybody talked like that.  

RR:	You see The Beatles, changes your life, you get a guitar . . .

JI:	And get in a band.

RR:	You were in a band!  I had no idea!

JI:	Of course I was in a band.  No, no, no, I was a bass player in a band.

RR:	Great!

JI:	I was a bass player.  The worst guitar player plays bass.  

RR:	That’s the rule?

JI:	That’s the rule.  That one is.  My cousin Gene played guitar.  He was better than me.

RR:	Was it a four piece band?

JI:	Five piece band.  Organ, two guitars; no, one guitar, drums, organ and a singer.  So there was one, two, three, four, five of us.  We had a band and we played, and then we got an agent in New York.  So we played, again, we were a cover band, that was it.  

RR:	And you’d play Beatles covers or everybody’s covers?

JI:	Everybody’s covers.  Anything that we could play.  

(0 hours, 20 minutes)

JI:	Stones were big, right?  We’d play some Beatles song, we’d play the Rascals.  We played Billy Joel’s band, the Hassles, we covered his songs.  Billy was incredible.  We opened for them one day.

RR:	Amazing!

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wasn’t the singer.  

RR:	I didn’t know that.  

JI:	There was a guy who was the singer.  Billy sang too, but he wasn’t . . .

RR:	He was just the keyboard player?

JI:	He was the organ player.  Billy sang, but they did a song . . . if you get a chance go listen to the Hassles You Got Me Humming.  

RR:	Let’s do it right now.  You want to?  Let’s hear it.

JI:	It’s awesome.  

RR:	Let’s hear it.  It’ll be fun.

JI:	I wonder if they have it on iTunes or something.  

RR:	Let’s see, Hassles.  I can just go to YouTube.

JI:	They’ll have it.  

RR:	Hassles . . . You Got Me?

JI:	You Got Me Humming.  It’s an old Sam and Dave song, I think.  See, we didn’t know that we were covering somebody who covered somebody.  That’s it.

(song starts in background)

RR:	It’s like Sitting on the Dock of the Bay.

JI:	Yeah, it’s an old soul song.  Listen to the guy sing.  He’s an Italian singer.  These kids sang great.  

(song continues in background)

JI:	That’s Billy’s singing.

RR:	Great.  Great.  There’s a video!

JI:	WOW!  

RR:	I’m sending this to you so you have it.  

JI:	Oh please!  

(song continues)

RR:	They look incredible.

JI:	They were incredible.  There was another band called The Illusion.  

(song ends)

RR:	That’s so good.

JI:	Wasn’t that great?

RR:	It’s great.

JI:	I told it was great.  It was the Rascals.  

RR:	And Billy Joel was in that band?

JI:	Billy Joel’s the organ player.  

RR:	Amazing. 

JI:	Yeah, he was great.  So he was a little older than me, still is.  I’m going to see him next Friday night with Stevie Nicks.  

RR:	Amazing.

JI:	Are you going?

RR:	Where’s he playing?

JI:	Sofi.  Him and Stevie Nicks co-head.  

RR:	I had no idea.

JI:	It’s gonna be awesome.  Stevie’s on fire!  

RR:	Really?

JI:	Stevie’s audience literally is 25 to 40 now.  It’s what’s happened.  I’m so happy for her, what’s happened to her.

RR:	Something happened where she just connected with a young group in a people in a way . . . it feels like it’s been going on for 20, 25 years.  Any young female artist you talk to always talks about Stevie Nicks.  It’s always like that’s one of the . . .

JI:	That’s it, no she’s Aretha.  She’s the Aretha of (white) rock singers.

RR:	Unbelievable.

JI:	I know, and I gotta tell you something man.  We’ve all recorded a lot of people.  To me, in my world, the most natural instrument was Stevie Nicks.  It was literally maybe two takes.

RR:	She just opens her mouth and it was perfect.

JI:	That’s how she sings and that’s how she sings that song.  That’s it.

RR:	Yes.

JI:	And you just go, wow.  

RR:	So cool, so cool.

JI:	Trent and Atticus are working with her right now on one song.

RR:	Amazing.

JI:	The song is really . . . she wrote an incredible song.  When we’re done, I’ll play it for you.  

RR:	Great, please.

JI:	Yeah, so you know I got in a band and then we started playing, we started getting some place, I mean as a cover band.  We played (Angano’s) which was a hot, hot club, we played Café (Wob) in the Village, which was incredible.  We played the (8th Wonder), we played Trudy Heller’s.  We played all those places, again, opening up for The Illusion and all these bands, Long Island.

RR:	What were the clubs on Long Island?  Do you remember?

JI:	Honka Monka.

RR:	Was My Father’s Place already there not yet?

JI:	My Father’s Place was a little later.  

RR:	I saw some shows there when I was growing up.

JI:	Yeah, yeah a little later.  Honka Monka was big, it was really big on Long Island and we played more in Manhattan.  We got lucky.  We met this woman that was an agent.  I’d never been to 59th Street and she was on 59th Street.  We went there and I remember just going up there with my band.  And she said I’ll get you some gigs and she did.  Then we broke up, about 17 or 18 years old and I don’t know what it was, but I just knew there was something regarding . . . what I realized was that I was never gonna be in The Rolling Stones.  I got that.  Right?  I was smart enough to know that, but I wanted to touch it.  So I realized that there were people that made the records, right?  There were people that were involved in the records, so I met this . . . fortunately, I really got lucky.  My cousin Pat knew this guy.  I mean, to show you how far away you were or I was from any kind of gig, right?  

RR:	It was an impossible idea to be in the music business.

JI:	Yes.  So I meet this guy named Steve (Chudanga) through my cousin who was a background singer for The Archies.  

RR:	Wow.  Good records.  (laughs)

JI:	Yes.  Background singer, not Ronnie Dante, a background singer.  I didn’t meet Ronny Dante, I met the background singer.

RR:	And I imagine not a lot touring work for The Archies, being as they were cartoons.  (laughs)

JI:	No, The Archies, right, the band, you know the records.  Member?

RR:	But it was a cartoon band.  They only existed in animated.

JI:	That’s exactly right.  So he was a writing partner of a legendary woman named Ellie Greenwich.

RR:	I know who Ellie Greenwich is.  From the Brill Building, that era of writing.

JI:	Yes, yes, so I used to go to her apartment after school and after work.

RR:	Incredible!

JI:	I had a job at the (Leading Male) on Kings Highway at the time.  I remember.  I met Ellie Greenwich and she had equipment in her room.  

RR:	Did she live in Manhattan?

JI:	She lived in Manhattan, I lived in Brooklyn.  I lived in Brooklyn the whole time, my mother’s house.

RR:	So you’re taking the train?

JI:	Yeah, my mother’s house.  So I go to Ellie’s house and I see she’s writing and recording, and then she started playing me some of the records that she produced.  I mean she wrote and produced Cherry Cherry.  I mean, you know.

RR:	Yes.  Incredible.

JI:	On Bang Records, right?  So I’m like, wow that sounded incredible.  I mean she wrote so many . . Doo Ron Ron, I Can Hear Music, Be My Baby, Chapel of Love.  She wrote all those records.  She wrote River Deep Mountain High.

RR:	Incredible.

JI:	Okay?  For Phil, right?  So one day she starting her  . . . Carole King comes out, does Tapestry.  Somebody told her, you should make an album.  So she went in and wrote and did an album called Let It Be Written, Let It Be Sung.  So she invites me to the session.  So I’m in the studio . . . first time I’ve ever been to a studio.

RR:	Do you remember what studio it was?

JI:	Oh yeah, A&R.  Phil Ramone’s studio.  It’s where I got my first job.  So absolutely I remember what studio it was.  And the engineer was named Elliot Scheiner.  He ended up doing all the Steely Dan records.  But in those days he did whatever was available, but all big stuff.  You know, big TV . . .

RR:	At that point was he a studio engineer, meaning if you went to the studio, he was your engineer?  They weren’t like independent engineers.

JI:	No, well I wasn’t an independent engineer, I was part of the staff.  There were staff engineers and you go there and they give you an engineer.  Unless you go there and the guy did Led Zeppelin, then you want him, right?  Or something like that.  You could ask for somebody, but you worked . . . So Elliot was a staff engineer for Phil Ramone.  Donnie Hahn, Elliot Scheiner, there was a bunch of guys and they were all very, very, very good.  My boss at the Record Plant where I used to (call) was also one of those engineers, but was already at the Record Plant.  
 So I go in and she’s out there singing Chapel, I remember it.  And all the lights are out and there’s candles.  I say what the fuck is this, right?  There’s candles everywhere.  It kinda looked like the Village or something, but it was this real sterile building.  And this guy Elliot Scheiner is there and he’s making the record.  And I’m saying, what is that?  Because he’s a recording engineer.  He’s got these big knobs and he’s turning the buttons and . . .

RR:	At this point is it like four-track or eight-track?  

JI:	No, no, it’s 8 and 16 at that point.  It’s 1971,1972.

RR:	Maybe just eight track.

JI:	Maybe eight track, probably eight, yeah, yeah yeah.  I saw that he had a leather bag and I’d never seen a leather bag before, especially on a guy.  Look at that.  At the end of the session, a girl, this really pretty girl came in and he said oh, I’m gonna go.  I forget her name, whatever it was and they left.  I said I don’t know what this is, but I want that.  At that moment.

RR:	The whole life.  You saw  . . .

JI:	All in one.  The guy had a leather jacket, a leather bag, clothes, right?  I’m sorry.

RR:	(laughing) You’re Italian.

JI:	I’m superficial.  I don’t know what to say.  I’m Italian, I’m going for the shit, you know what I mean.  I’m not looking for substance.

RR:	No, it’s great.

JI:	I’m looking for a gig to get out of Brooklyn and get some money and buy clothes.  So that’s it.  So anyway, Ellie Greenwich got me a job in that studio.  

RR:	Amazing.  

JI:	Right, so what happens is I get a 90, 90 . . . I’ll tell you a great story, though . . . I get a 90-day trial.  In that 90-day trial, one day an assistant, I was below an assistant at A&R.  An assistant couldn’t make it in, so the assistant . . . no the engineer couldn’t make it, so the assistant did the job, I became the assistant.  It was a Saturday.  It was James Brown.

RR:	Wow!  

JI:	Right?  So I’m in there and I’m just terrified of everything, not just James Brown, abject fear.  I don’t know how to do anything.

RR:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.

JI:	Right?  So we do the vocal.  Every time he would come into the control room and sit in the director’s chair, this guy would pick his hair because the headphones would dent his afro.  So he’d do that, had a towel around, there was a guy that just used to put towels around him and stuff.  

RR:	Even in the studio?  Because he had that on stage too.

JI:	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  In the studio.  Absolutely.  Tap his forehead, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  First time I ever saw anything like that.  I was like, wow, that’s incredible!  As he’s leaving the studio.

RR:	First, tell me more about how great was James Brown.

JI:	Unbelievable.

RR:	Could you believe what you were seeing?

JI:	No.  The guy was in the vocal booth dancing, singing and just being James Brown.  Right?  It was unbelievable, it was incredible.  

RR:	Unbelievable.

JI:	At the end of the session, I’m cleaning up.  The guy walks over to me, I think the guy’s name was George, but I could be wrong.  The guy walks over to me, puts $50 in my hand and says Mr. Brown wants you to have this.  

RR:	How cool is that?  

JI:	Right?

RR:	James Brown!

JI:	So I go home and I run . . . the next morning, (Jerry the Cat), my drummer, comes over to my house and I look at him and I said I’m gonna make a lot . . . I’m gonna be rich here.  Okay?  What do you mean?  Let me tell you something, I got $50 last night . . .

RR:	Let’s talk about how much $50 was then.  

JI:	1972.  

RR:	What would it be like today?

JI:	I don’t know, I gotta look it up.

RR:	In your guesstimation.  The feel.  Based on the feel of it.

JI:	Probably I guess, let me talk it through it actually, probably $250.  You know what I mean?  Like money.  

RR:	A lot of money.

JI:	Like if somebody gives you a hundred bucks or somebody gives you $200, $250, that feels like real money, right?

RR:	Absolutely.  

JI:	You could buy something in Gucci or something.  (laughs)

RR:	What were you making the studio?

JI:	Four dollars an hour.  

RR:	So to put in perspective . . .

JI:	Yeah, four dollars an hour.  So I go home and I said okay, you know me, I’m gonna work every day.  Fifty dollars a day I got chalk in the street, $50 a day times 365 on top of my salary. I never got a tip again, but I had no idea.

RR:	Of course.  But you were inspired.

JI:	When you come from that world, Rick, and so do you, you don’t know anything.  There’s no sophistication, I didn’t go to school.  I walked into this place because she told me to.

RR:	Yeah.  And I’ll tell you, even for the people who came from a more substantial background, no one teaches you how to be successful because nobody knows.

JI:	Not even close.

RR:	Nobody knows.

JI:	Especially in that world.  I mean, it was crazy, right?  I mean my mother and my sister, before I went to work, literally, because I was brought up as the prince in an Italian family with a bunch of women, right?  My aunt, my cousins are downstairs.  They taught me how to sweep the night before the gig.  They showed me literally how to sweep because I knew I had to sweep.  I said, Mom, I don’t know how to sweep.  You never made me sweep.  So they taught me how to sweep.  

RR:	Amazing.

JI:	It’s pretty primitive.  It’s pretty primitive, right?

RR:	So cool.  Mr. Brown wants you to have this.

JI:	Mr. Brown wants you to have this.

RR:	How cool is that?

JI:	Unbelievable.  I wish I kept it, but I needed it.  So 89th day, I get fired.  The guys says to me, his name was Don Hahn, right.  He was a chief engineer.  He was everybody’s boss.  He said you know, I’m sorry, this is not for you.  So I said look, my father . . . because I had left college. . . I said my father said if this doesn’t I’ve gotta go back to school before I come home.

RR:	Right, which you don’t want to do.

JI:	He said I don’t know what to say.  Remember, I left school because of the draft.  I got a high number in the lottery.  I got like 265 and they didn’t draft up until 180.  So the day that happened, I left school and went to work.  So he said I’m sorry.  So I’m leaving and this is where . . . I got into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently and on the speech I said about mentors and helping kids, just be a mentor to kids.  This woman, Ellie Greenwich, I called her up on the way home.  Now think about this for yourself.  I called her from a payphone.  I said Ellie, I was just sort of crying, you know.

RR:	Of course.

JI:	I said I got fired on the 89th day.  She says hang up, call me back in 10 minutes.  She called the Record Plant, I called her back and she said don’t go home.  She says go to 321 W. 44th Street, ask for Eddie German and Roy Cicala.  I walk in there and they hired me.  

RR:	Wow!  Unbelievable.  And then how long did you work at the Record Plant?

JI:	That was where my career started.  It was 1973 at that point.  I worked in the Record Plant until I came to California.  I was a staff engineer.

RR:	So like six years?

JI:	Yeah, yeah.  I was a staff engineer and then I started producing at the Record Plant.

RR:	How did you trained as an engineer?

JI:	Roy Cicala.  Roy Cicala was the greatest engineer teacher ever.  Very eccentric guy.  So eccentric that he had like . . . we didn’t know what it was, it was OCD.  We didn’t know what OCD was, right?  He wouldn’t like touch things that other people touched.  You know, stuff like that, right?  When he wanted to train you, you became his assistant and it was like, literally like boot camp.  It was hard, right?  But he liked me.  So now I’m in the studio and he’s teaching me, but because he doesn’t want to touch everything, he would make me do it.  He’d say give me 2 dB at 10,000.

RR:	I see, which worked out great for you because you have all the hands on experience.  Amazing.  So lucky.

JI:	Bizarrely lucky.  

RR:	Series of events that are like these magic . . . blessed.

JI:	And you’re the man that fell from earth, which is what my sister used to call me.  Fell to earth rather.  So now I’m really learning because I’ve gotta beat . . . I’m 24/7 with this guy.  This guy was the busiest engineer in New York City and he was doing John Lennon, he’s doing . . . anybody who came to the Record Plant wanted him, right?  Or this other guy, Shelly (Atkiss).  You know Jack Douglas was an engineer, the guy who produced John Lennon and Aerosmith.  The guy who produced Walk This Way was Jack Douglas, right?  

RR:	Yes.

JI:	I see him still.  

RR:	Great.

JI:	He put me on everything and then one day he was going to California, no first they brought me in because he had another assistant who something happened, he ended up taking him off the project and he brought me in on Mind Games at the end.  And that was September ’73.

RR:	This is after you . . . basically the reason you’re doing this is because you see The Beatles on Ed Sullivan, and now you’re in the studio with John Lennon.

JI:	That’s right.

RR:	It’s unbelievable.

JI:	I didn’t they were the same person.  It was too much.

RR:	Too much.

JI:	So I’m just like . . . how do I not get thrown out of this room because I’ve been thrown out of a few rooms.  I’m sweaty, Rick; how do I not get thrown outta this room.  How can I just overdo it, how do I just serve.  How do I just be of service.

RR:	Yes!  

JI:	Tea!  I learned how to make John Lennon’s tea.  He wouldn’t let anybody else make it. I timed it exactly.  I was like . . . the way I am about everything, I was about that fucking tea.  So everything, the mikes, the thing, whatever Roy told me, writing on the boxes, doing . . . you know.  And then, as time went on, Roy like all of us, which I know you’ve done, I’ve done, we’ve all done it.  Starts to get old a little bit and you just start handing off things to other people.

(0 hours, 40 minutes)

So now, right after that, this crazy thing happened with Lennon is Morris Levy sued John over I believe it’s Come Together and Chuck Barry You Can’t Catch Me.  He said he ripped ‘em off, right?  So they made a settlement and Morris Levy said I want you to do an album of my songs because he had . . . Morris Levy was a gangster.  

RR:	Is that why he did those songs?  I didn’t know that.

JI:	Nobody knows that.

RR:	The Rock and Roll album?

JI:	Yeah.  So now he decides he wants to use Phil Spector, Phil Spector won’t come to New York.  Roy says I want you to come with me to California because you’ll set the studio up for me.  I want it to sound exactly like the Record Plant.  

RR:	I see.

JI:	Go there, I want you to turn it into the Record Plant.  

RR:	And what was the studio in L.A.?

JI:	A&M.  Studio A.

RR:	Wow.  This is a full circle story.  We’re gonna get to that.

JI:	For me it is, yeah.  

RR:	Unbelievable.

JI:	So now I’m in there and the first day I go to the studio, I start tuning the speakers, right?  Because I learned how to do that.  So now I’m tuning the speakers to get the sound like I know Roy likes them to sound, so I’m playing Mind Games, I’m playing some other records that I assisted on with him.

RR:	Was that your first time in California?

JI:	Yeah.  John put me at the Beverly Hills Hotel in a bungalow!  

RR:	Amazing.  (laughs)

JI:	I had just turned 20.  

RR:	Amazing.

JI:	Right.  I didn’t know.  I’d never been on a plane.  Never been on a plane, never been to a hotel.  I was once to the Host Motel in Philadelphia with my mother, but other than that.

RR:	And you’re still living at home with your mom at home.

JI:	Oh yeah!  

RR:	This is amazing.  

JI:	In Brooklyn, in that house.  

RR:	Amazing.

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So now I’m in the studio, now I gotta go get the setup.  So I gotta go to Phil’s house in Benedict Canyon.  

RR:	You’ve never met him before?

JI:	I’ve never been to a big house.  I never . . . nothing!  Nothing.  

RR:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JI:	So now there’s a gate and there’s a driveway.  He lived on Benedict Canyon or somewhere, somewhere around there.  So I go there and I go in the foyer and I said I’m here to see Phil Spector.  Who’s that?  But he’s talking.  I don’t see him, he’s talking from the upstairs.  I said I’m here, I’m here on behalf of John Lennon and Cicala, I need the setup for tomorrow.  Okay.  Eight musicians; guitar, bass, three guitars, dadada.  Eight musicians.  I said okay.  Anything else?  No.  I leave, I go to A&M the next day and I’m setting up.  I made it look like . . .  I’m telling you, it was a painting.  Every cable wired.  You couldn’t trip if you wanted to trip. Every microphone, every music stand, every echo tuned, every patch cord in, every piece of equipment, tape everywhere, written down.  I was nuts about getting this right, right?  So now I’m the first one in the studio.  Two guys walk in, four guys walk in, three more guys walk in, 36 guys walk in.  

RR:	Musicians?

JI:	Yes.  We’re here for the Phil Spector session.  I’m like what?  Phil, which is how he records, from when I left his house, to the next morning, hired 36 musicians.  Eight guitar players, two drummers, Hal Blaine and Jim Keltner.

RR:	Wow.

JI:	Okay?  Two bass players.  Six horns.  Three pianos.  Leon Russell and Barry Mann.  Playing the piano.  Okay?  Three background singers; Cher, Harry Nilsson and I forgot who the other one was.  

RR:	Unbelievable.

JI:	Right?  So now I’m like oh fuck, I gotta rearrange . . . I said give me an hour, I’ll rearrange, I get some help from the studio, the kid that worked from the studio, etc.  

RR:	That’s a lot of setting up.  That’s a big session.  

JI:	Oh man, that’s a lot.  That’s a lot live.  Live?  How about 36 headphones?  How about balancing the headphones with only two headphone buses.

RR:	Impossible.  Very difficult task.

JI:	It’s not 36 strings.  It’s 36 musicians.  Banging.  So now Phil comes in and this went on every night.  So he comes in, now these guys, everybody knows this story.  

RR:	Is John there yet or no?

JI:	He wasn’t there when the 36 guys came in, but it wasn’t my job to tell him.  My job was it’s ready.  But he really trusted me, so him and Roy were both really really patient with me, really good with me.  They were always very kind to me.  Roy was tough, but John was always really, really kind.  So now Phil comes in.  First, he got on a white butcher’s coat.

RR:	Like a meat cutting butcher?

JI:	A coat, right.  So now the band starts playing.  They’re doing like Boney Maroney or something like that, right?  One of those songs.  And there’s four tape machines, quarter inch tapes with slap because Phil liked a lot of slap.  And John liked a lot of slap.  Right?  We’re at a standup console in Studio A.  At the time there was a standup console.  We both had to run the console because there’s too much for one guy.

RR:	Of course, you don’t have that many hands.  

JI:	You don’t have that many hands.  There’s like 36 people.

RR:	And there’s no such thing as automation or anything like that.

JI:	We had four guitar players on one bus.  We had no choice.  We had to balance it from outside.  We had to just move the mics in and out to what we . . . you know?  It was real, real analog.  Whenever he wanted our attention, he had a boat horn.  RRRRRR!  

RR:	The air horn?  Those are loud.

JI:	Unbelievably loud.

RR:	And horrible.

JI:	So now you’re scared.  You don’t what the fuck . . .

RR:	And you’re going deaf.  

JI:	It was horrible.  So now we’re making the album and then eventually, about a week and a half in, he comes in with the butcher coat, but now he’s got guns strapped to him.  He’s got two guns strapped to the fucking chest.  Again, I’m not scared because I’m too busy.

RR:	Yeah, you’re just working.

JI:	I’m not giving this job up.

RR:	Did you talk to Phil at all?  What was he like?

JI:	Yeah, there’s a documentary out which is exactly like he’s like.  There’s a new documentary on Phil.  His voice is high like mine, you know what I mean, like that kind of voice.  

RR:	Does he talk fast, does he talk slow?

JI:	Yeah, he’s from Philly.  A Jewish guy.  Give me that note . . . (does an impersonation).  Cher’s out there, hey whore, you, screaming at her.  Yelling.  And this guy’s shut up.  Hey put Barry Mann on the grand, put Leon on the (Fender Row) because that will fuck will Leon’s head.  

RR:	Just chaos.

JI:	Chaos.  Chaos, chaos.  Complete chaos.  Yelling at people, calling Cher . . .

RR:	Like him and John got along good?

JI:	I’m gonna add that element into it right now.  Here’s the element.  Alcohol.  Pounds of it, gallons of it.  There was a Smirnoff bottle about this big, this big, the Smirnoff bottle.  

RR:	And they’re just drinking.

JI:	Drinking the whole time.  

RR:	Both Phil and John.  

JI:	This is not a secret.  Everybody.  I’m gonna take this off.  (sound of zipper).  

RR:	This is an incredible story.

JI:	It is.

RR:	I can’t believe I know you as long as I know you, and I’ve never heard this story.

JI:	Not a lot people know this story.

RR:	This is an unbelievable story.

JI:	So now he’s yelling at everybody and it’s crazy, and I’m just trying to get it on tape.  Right?  And my boss is a very quiet, stoic kind of guy.  Quiet, but he’s tough.  Sitting there and saying give me this, give me that.  John’s mic’s not working.  I’m running.  Like a hundred miles an hour, into the studio, changing the mic, fixing the mic.  You know.  No. 7 guitar player, the mic’s not working, give me a new mic.  Try something more directional.

(0 hours, 50 minutes)

RR:	And also the more people that are there, the more pressure there is because there’s a lot of people waiting around for everything always.  

JI:	Yeah, how about have a water, tea.  

RR:	I’m just picturing how stressful it is for people who don’t know the situation, it’s incredibly stressful.  

JI:	And everybody’s talking at once.  And they’re all asking you for something.  And the drummer’s fucking around so you can’t hear anything.

RR:	Yeah, you can’t hear anything.  

JI:	(making sounds like a drummer and a bass)  So we record, I don’t know, three weeks like that or something like that.

RR:	Did it settle in at any point where . . .

JI:	No.

RR:	Stayed difficult.

JI:	I had to go out and get the alcohol as well, so I had borrowed the identification, because I was only 20, of the guy at the front desk to go buy the alcohol.  There was a liquor store on the corner.  I had a guy helping from A&M, but a lot of it . . . As far as Roy was concerned and John, it was on me.  Remember, I’m only there six months at the Record Plant.  So now Phil . . . this is even crazier.  So Phil one night, and this is a book that just came out, the Tony King book.  I don’t know if you know Tony King.  

RR:	I don’t know Tony King.

JI:	He was the president of Apple.  So now everybody’s really drunk.  Everybody knows that during this period of time it was called the lost weekend for John that he got drunk.

RR:	Just so I have an idea, how long are the sessions every day?

JI:	I don’t really remember, but you know, I’d get there at noon and they’d go to like 11 or 12.  

RR:	So you have a 12 hour hard day every day.

JI:	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So now Phil goes crazy.  I used to drive John home and then this one night Phil wanted to drive him home with his bodyguard.  And a book just came out, you can read about this, and John was drunk and they tied him up.  Right?  So now the album falls apart.

RR:	John did not take kindly to being tied up.

JI:	No, he didn’t.  Neither did anybody around him.  You know.  It was a nightmare.

RR:	But up until that time, what was the relationship between Phil and John like?

JI:	Producer, artist.  

RR:	Was John going along with all of Phil’s craziness or just cool?

JI:	Yeah.

RR:	John was experienced.  He was already a Beatle.  

JI:	John was into  . . . everybody was in that moment and in that mindset.  It was out there, it was really out there, right?  So John was amazing.  I gotta tell you, man, there wasn’t one day he wasn’t splendid to me.  Not one . . . I did a lot of shit with him.  I did the Salute to Lew Grade.  I did that TV show with him.  I did three albums with him.  You know what three albums is.  People don’t understand it.   Even people are listening to his.  

RR:	You live with him.

JI:	You’re sitting next to the guy for three albums, 200 days or whatever it is.  No, more than that, it was 2 years.  So he was drinking at the time, and that’s no secret, it’s in every book in the world.

RR:	And this is when he’s not with Yoko, is that correct?

JI:	Right.  But before that, I forgot this, before that, Phil went to the bathroom and shot the place up.  Right?  During the session.  Right?  

RR:	Wild.

JI:	Oh, another thing that you would be interested in.  During the session, David Geffen is going out with Cher.  Right?  So David walks in.  Now I know this is David Geffen, right?  At A&M David’s leaning against the wall, Phil’s behind me, and I’m at the headphone console which is right near the door.  So what people don’t understand, I’m in a recording studio right now, this is not a big room.  You know what I mean, and the room was not that much bigger than this.  So David comes in and he starts yelling, you dadada at David.  So David something very Davidish.

RR:	Phil is yelling at David?

JI:	Yeah.  And David, very David, says something sarcastic to him like I don’t know about you, but right now I have number 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8.  Something like that.  He just pisses him off.

RR:	At this point in time, does David have Asylum?  Is this Asylum days?

JI:	No, no, ’73, yeah, whatever it was.  

RR:	Asylum is a big label.

JI:	Whatever ’73 was, he was very successful, we all know, right?  So Phil goes after him and then all of a sudden Phil . . .

RR:	Physically?

JI:	Yeah, and then Phil goes into a karate stance.  Ha!!  I’m like holy shit.  These people do this too?  You know what I mean.  Like I’ve seen fights, weird shit growing up, but I didn’t know . . 

RR:	Everybody’s crazy.  Turns out, everybody’s crazy.  

JI:	That’s exactly right.  So now we get thrown out of the studio.  Oh!  I left one thing out.  So it was ’73 . . . I don’t know about you, but this is 50 years ago, so some of this stuff blends together.  

RR:	Of course, of course.

JI:	So Phil calls me up one day and says we’re canceling the studio.  I said why are we canceling the studio, Phil.  All the musicians are coming.  Do you hear this?  I don’t hear anything.  He does there’s helicopters over my house.  They think I’ve got the Watergate tapes.  I don’t even know the Water tapes are.

RR:	But he’s completely paranoid.

JI:	I’m in a zone, right.  So it was like stuff like that going on all the time.  

RR:	Unbelievable.  It gotta pee.  This is unbelievable.

JI:	It’s fun, right?

RR:	It’s crazy.

JI:	I’m still only 20.

RR:	Life’s good, man.  

JI:	I’m still only 20 by the way.

RR:	I’m so glad I asked you to do this.  

(a minute of silence while the restroom is used)

(sound of a recording with Johnny Cash, singing ‘The hairs on your arm will standup’)

JI:	Fuck, who sang this song?  Who wrote it?

RR:	Johnny.  

JI:	This is a great one.  Who wrote Delia?  Delilah?  Delia?

RR:	Ophelia.  (inaudible, off microphone)  Crazy, right?  That one was one of the songs, that one you just played, he was working on for like 10 years.  He felt like this was my thing, I never felt like I got it right.  I’m ready now.

(1 hour, 0 minutes)

JI:	Wow, what a gift.  Buy anyway, so all the things run together, but all I can say is that John was magnificent to me every day.  Every day, was the greatest guy, wanted to teach me.  He and Roy taught me together.  During Walls and Bridges, Roy’s wife had a baby.  So he took off six weeks and left me along with John, and I did all the overdubs on the album.

RR:	Incredible.

JI:	I was 21 at this point and I’m just like what a way to learn.  It’s set.  I didn’t know, I didn’t have great taste in music when I was a kid.  I wasn’t the first guy to have The Stones record.  I wasn’t the first guy to hear Cream, like my friend Ali played me Cream.  I was always a little behind, but I really learned.  Ever since those sessions, it’s how I made records until I quit making records with the live vocal, so I had to feel the vocal.  So when John sang live all the time, I would just wait, we would wait until he got the vocal.  It didn’t have to be 100% finished vocal, but the feel was based on the vocal.  

RR:	So everybody’s playing off the vocal.

JI:	That’s right, and you don’t get a take until it’s right.  Right?  So I recorded like that my entire life, but those six weeks with John, I got really lucky, but I was a little terrified.  During those sessions we did Whatever Gets You Through the Night, which is a really fun song.   It was a single from the album and Elton at the time was bigger than U.S. Steel.  You know what I mean.  He was . . . it was 1974 so he had  . . .

RR:	Huge.

JI:	I remember he had three number ones that year, some crazy stuff.  And Tony King again brought him to the session and Elton was going to sing on the session.  So he comes in and I’m terrified, and John says to me, I said John, Elton John’s coming to the studio.  

(Rick really laughs)

JI:	Okay?  I said I’m really nervous.  He said trust me, he’s more nervous than you, I’m a Beatle.  

RR:	Yeah.

JI:	And then he told this story about . . . I hope I have the song right, he said I was recording with Eric or somebody, right?  Did Eric play on Cold Turkey?  

RR:	I don’t know.

JI:	I don’t know, but one of those songs.  And the guy froze up.

RR:	Eric froze up?

JI:	One of the great classic Jeff Beck . . . one of those guys froze up and John said I told him PLAY YOU BASTARD because he was nervous because he was in the room with me.  You have to understand, in 1973, again, remember I told you it’s hard to explain the big bang of ’64.  

RR:	Yes, of The Beatles.

JI:	Being around The Beatles in 1970 to ’74, there was nothing like it.  I’ve never met a celebrity since, never.  Nothing.

RR:	There’s nothing like that.  There’s never been anything like that.  

JI:	No, those four guys  . . . right after the The Beatles broke, even during, I didn’t know them during The Beatles, but people froze.  Froze.  Musicians froze.  

RR:	Of course.

JI:	So now we’re recording the vocals.  I’m saying to myself, I never really recorded a piano without Roy.  My boss.  So I say I hope he doesn’t want to play the fucking piano, right, so I’m saying this to myself.  

RR:	Interesting though, interesting.  Interesting problem.

JI:	Right.  So now they’re facing each other with these two really dynamic microphones singing.  If you listen to the record, you hear how thin and high-pitched they are.  They’re on a really not dynamic mic.  And I hear Elton say, let me try piano.  I’m like oh fuck.  Unbelievable.  Son of a bitch.  So I had to remember how I set it up for Roy and I just did that.  To show you what kind of guy John was, so Elton walks in and he says hey, great piano sound.  John says, ‘that’s why we use him.’  He’s fucking around because he knew I was nervous.  He would just give me a shot on anything and everything.  I don’t understand it, I don’t understand it until today.  It isn’t because I was talented, it was because he liked me and he felt he could trust me.  He told me that once.  He say, you know, working with me, people are going to ask you to get to me and I can tell you’re the kind of kid that won’t.  And I learned . . 

RR:	Yeah, you’re protective of him, of course.

JI:	Well I didn’t know that.  I got it.  I learned and what I’m trying to say is that whatever kids are out there trying to do stuff, don’t be embarrassed of what you don’t know.  Cause it’s charming and it’s open and it’s honest.  

RR:	Absolutely.

JI:	And the people around you would rather hear you don’t know or say you do know and blow something up.  I’ve always been like that.  I always tell everybody, we’re getting to this.  I say man in 1991 I had no idea what fucking hip hop was.  I wasn’t Russell Simmons, I wasn’t Rick Rubin, I landed on it.  But the only thing that I saw in hip hop was the whole world should hear this and I have a record company, and I’m gonna spend the fucking money to let everybody hear this.  When I went to sign Death Row, Doug called me and said, my entire black music department here says you’re paying so much money, this stuff doesn’t . . .  first of all, it doesn’t sell more than what the Easy E album, they said it’s impossible.  And it doesn’t travel outside of America, and you’re gonna get killed.  I said, I gotta tell you, Doug, I don’t believe any of those three things.  I said as a producer, I had nothing . . . I had massive hits in Europe, outside of America as a producer.  As a matter of fact, you’re paying groups like Dire Straits and Simple Minds used to hire me.  I understood for some reason.  I don’t know what the fuck it is, you know what I mean.  

RR:	Yes, but it worked.

JI:	I was good with those groups.  So I said they’re going to be dancing to this in China.  Now I had no idea.  I’m telling you man, I said this before.  It reminded me of The Rolling Stones.  It was like Mick and Keith.  I said I know who these guys are.  They scare the fuck out of you, but you love the music so much that you go in closer.

RR:	Dangerous music has always been popular.  

JI:	Right?  But when you add black to it, it does another thing.  That’s what’s wrong with the world.  Especially America.  But I wasn’t one of those guys.  So I remember with Dre and Suge first came in it was . . . anyway, go back, we’re doing chronological shit.  

RR:	It doesn’t have to be.  We can jump around however you like.

JI:	I remember when they came in.  They had an album finished.

RR:	Was Straight Outta Compton already out as an independent record?

JI:	Oh yeah, they were on Ruthless.  This is when Suge got that quote, got Dre off of Ruthless Records.  Okay? Got him off of Ruthless Records and they were being sued . . .  When I made that deal for them, they were being sued by Sony, Ruthless, Brian Turner and a guy named Michael Harris, who attempted murder on his cousin or something.  Sorry if I have it wrong, but he was in jail for life.  Trump pardoned him recently.  I’m just saying . . . I hear he’s a good guy and stuff, but he was suing Death Row as well.  

So I had to settle all four of those cases with the people.  So I said, man, fuck this.  I believe in these guys.  John McClane brought ‘em in, told me this was it.  I’m good as listening to people.

RR:	How long did you know John McClane?

JI:	I knew him from A&M.  We did a mix together.  The Hollywood remix of Desire.  Wonderful.  

RR:	Did you make many records for A&M?

JI:	No, I was just at the studio.  Never worked out.  

RR:	So you met him at the studio?  I understand.

JI:	I just built the studio with this guy Shelly (Atkiss).  So now, we go and settle out those lawsuits and I really don’t remember why Michael Harris was in jail, but he was in jail for I’m not quite sure how long.  

RR:	Let’s talk more about what you saw, so you saw the Easy E record came out first, then Straight Outta Compton came out.  Those records were blowing up and they were . . . I know my interest in hip hop at that time was at a low point until I heard those.  That was like, oh.

(1 hour, 10 minutes)

JI:	I didn’t get that either.  The first time I understood anything about hip hop is Bono brought Lyor Cohen and Chuck D to A&M studios because they were going to open up for U2.  So I invited them to my house in Malibu, right?  I listened to them talk and I was understanding it, but I still didn’t get it.  I’ll be honest with you, I was producing U2, I wasn’t paying attention, right?  And I wanted to get out of producing.  

RR:	And you were also busy.  Your plate was full somewhere else.  

JI:	Yeah, and I was doing other stuff.  I was doing the Christmas album, A Very Special Christmas, and now it’s 1990 or ’91.

RR:	Let’s talk about starting the label because that’s a big story.

JI:	Right, well what happened to me was I was producing and I was burnt on it.  I knew it.  I was 18 years and I was burnt.  And I just said, I had a kid, it was 1988, I had my son Jamie.  And even though they didn’t ask me to do it, they told me they were going to Germany, to Berlin to do their next album.  In Berlin the wall had just come down, I know it’s freezing there.  I’m like, oh man, I just had a baby, I gotta go to Berlin?  Remember, they just almost killed me on the last album, on Rattle & Hum.  I was like, these fucking . . . it’s like four on one.  

RR:	And it’s a maddening process.

JI:	Maddening, right?  So we’re doing two albums, a live album, a studio album and a movie.  So I just was fried.  I said I’m not doing this.  And something else happened, I don’t want to sound altruistic and I don’t want to sound all phony.  Geffen sold his company, so I was like, wait a minute, I think he does what I do.  He just made all this fucking money, right?  Then I said I’m also not getting . . . I’m not going to be getting the young groups.  You know, when you get to a certain level . . .

RR:	Yeah, you’ve grown up, of course.

JI:	The labels don’t give you . . . they think you’re gonna be too expensive.  In those days, that’s what it was like.  The labels would try to avoid you, get you their group on the third album, right?  When they knew a little bit more.  So I said to David, hey I want to start a record company.  You should do it.  There are a lot of record people a lot dumber than you.  

RR:	(laughs)  That’s inspiring.  

JI:	Right?  I said I believe that.

RR:	You also dealt with a lot of record people over the years, even as a producer.

JI:	Yeah, but when he said I, I’m always a fan of David and he’s always been great to me, so when he said, I said  . . .

RR:	First time you met him was when he was in the room with Phil?

JI:	I didn’t meet him.  

RR:	You just saw him.  That’s the first time you were in his presence.

JI:	The first time I met him was 1980, John Landau set up lunch for me at Le Dome.  

RR:	At your request?

JI:	No, at John’s request.  John said you should meet this guy.  They were starting Geffen Records.  He says you should meet this kid, he’s a great producer.  That’s what John said, so I met David.  We had a very nice lunch and we became friends.  Right?  And he just constantly stayed in my life and it helped me.  So when he sold his company, I’m like man, there’s that.  He introduced me to Ted Field.

RR:	David introduced you to Ted Field?

JI:	David talked to Ted first and Ted said I want somebody to run a record company.  His, Eric and Eddie Rosenblatt said I think Jimmy could do this for you.  I hear he wants to start a record company.  Because I was going to start a record company and go through David.  

RR:	Originally you were going to do it with Irving, and then Irving . . . I remember.

JI:	Yes, that’s right.  That’s right.  Then I think Mo didn’t want didn’t want me in the game, on Irving’s deal.  I think Mo just felt . . . he didn’t see it, whatever.

RR:	Do you know that to be true?

JI:	I’m not gonna say it on the air, but that’s what blah said.  You know what I mean, so who knows what the truth it.

RR:	We never know.  We never know.

JI:	But Mo’s always nice to me.  

RR:	Me too.  Knowing Mo, that’s out of character.  That’s why I say it.

JI:	Whatever it is, they canceled the deal.  I had a deal and it got canceled for one reason or another.  So I went to Dave and he said this guy Ted Field . . . Jimmy’s looking to start a label, right?  I just said . . . somebody Mo said it, but maybe not, who knows.  At any rate, it doesn’t matter, it didn’t work out.  Maybe (INAUDIBLE), but I don’t remember. So I meet Ted.  Paul McGinnis, you know how things come together?  Paul McGinnis also met Ted and mentioned it, right?  So this guy, Tony Dimitriades, everybody kind of supported, but David was the guy that, like does, focused.  And I went to him and I said David, you know Doug wants to put up half the money and David said do what’s right for you.  I just sold my company, I don’t give a shit.  Do what’s right for you.  And I took the money from Doug.  Because then it made it easier for Ted.  I didn’t want to be reliant on one person for the money.  That’s never safe, right?  So we did it.

RR:	I remember you calling me and you said, I can’t remember if it was a million or a billion . . . it must have been a billion.  I just signed a billionaire.  (laughs)

JI:	Right, right.  Found out he wasn’t.  

RR:	Whatever it was, that was the perception.

JI:	Maybe it was.  He had a lot . . . I would definitely say that.

RR:	You did.  I’m telling you did, I was there.  I remember because it was so funny.  

JI:	Yeah, I would definitely say that.  I got my first deal to start a record company and then we started Interscope.  John McClane was with Ted and Tom Whalley, and John McClane walked in and he said this is the guy.

RR:	Who was the first band you signed?  Or the first group of artists.

JI:	The first thing we signed, first thing was Gerardo, Rico Suave.

RR:	Right, and you have a hit out of the box.

JI:	I wanted a hit.  I didn’t give a fuck if it was the cha cha cha.  I wanted my promotion team to have a hit.  And it worked.  Then Tom Whalley brought in Primus and Helmet, who were great.  Then we got Tupac and then we got No Doubt.  

RR:	How did Tupac come in?  

JI:	Through Tom.  Tom was a great A&R guy.  So was John.  So I wasn’t in the record business, so I didn’t know anybody, but they would bring me in and I would get them out of their deals and I would figure it all out.  Like this guy that used to do PA, managed Lone Justice with me, brought Gwen in.  I hired him at Interscope.  I went down to No Doubt’s rehearsal and I said these guys are great.  I saw her.

RR:	And they were huge.

JI:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just saying, you remember those days, right?

RR:	Absolutely.

JI:	So Dre and Suge just came to my office and John said play it, and he’d play me The Chronic.  And I remember the time because they were friends of yours.  I tried to list the Hank Shocklee records.  If you’re an engineer in music and rock and roll, you’re trying to get everything to be really present and really powerful.  (muffles himself)  And it sounds like this.  The whole subwoof . . . what do you call that . . . the low bass.

RR:	The subs.  We call it the subs.

JI:	Yeah, but also there was a bass.

RR:	The 808?

JI:	Yeah!  They didn’t have the 808 on the control.  Nobody knew how to . . . and then all of a sudden Dre walks in and it sounds like Pink Floyd.  It’s one of the greatest recordings I’d ever heard.  Any kind of music.  So now I feel like I know something about this.

RR:	Yeah, because Dre’s is not sloppy in any way.  

JI:	It’s not like anybody else’s.  And then, also I don’t understand samples.  And he, everybody’s playing live.  Got a few things in there, but the bass and drums are players.  Right?  So I’m like, who produced this?  He said me.  I say yeah, but who engineered it?  He said me.  I’ll never forget it.  I said this guy will define Interscope.  And that was it.  That day.  As soon as I heard that on my Tannoy’s that I mixed all the albums on, that was in my office; I bought them in London.  I bought them in Oxfordshire, I bought them.  I remember I was doing an album with The Motors in England and I heard these speakers.  I went to the factory or something, and I bought them.  I knew those speakers and I just said, I gotta get this.

(1 hour, 20 minutes)

I said to Suge and Dre, give me three weeks.  Now if you guys fuck around go to a lot of different labels, I’m gonna hear about it and I’m gonna bounce.  I’ll tell you what, they kept their word.  And I did and we settled with Michael Harris, Jerry Heller, what was his name, Sony.   I mean there was a Rico case on these guys.  Yeah.  And Brian Turner, Priority.  I settled with everybody, they were all very happy.  I wrote checks, right?  And that was it.  And then we put the record out and the rest is you know what.

RR:	Tell me about Doug.  Your relationship with Doug.  When did you first meet Doug?

JI:	Stevie Nicks.  

RR:	She was on Atlantic.

JI:	She was on Atlantic.

RR:	Doug was already running Atlantic?  Or Ahmet was still there?

JI:	No, he was the head of Atco.  

RR:	Doug was the head of Atco and Ahmet was still running Atlantic.

JI:	Atco was an associated label, so they brought in Modern Records, Danny Goldberg and Paul Fishkin, and they went to Doug.  And Danny and Paul and Doug, they asked me to go meet Doug because they wanted me to produce Stevie’s album.  He said he wanted to meet the guy that was going produce the album and I had just done Damn the Torpedoes.  And Stevie loved Damn the Torpedoes.  She loved Tom Petty.  

RR:	And you’d never worked with Stevie before this?

JI:	No, no.  Fleetwood Mac was like this giant supersonic California . . . I didn’t even know they were English.  

RR:	Absolutely.

JI:	I just knew it as out of my range.  Background harmonies.  You know what I mean.

RR:	Yes, huge.  

JI:	It was like that is that.  Right?  So I go to meet her and I get the gig.  We’re finishing up Tom and I was gonna start her.  Then we ended up doing Hard Promises first.  It’s funny because we share Tom, you and I.  

RR:	You had him first.

JI:	Unfortunately I’m 10 years old than you.  I’m gonna do a lot things first.

RR:	Everything.  Everything we’re talking about, you did first.  

JI:	Our birthdays are a day apart, 10 years apart.  I meet Stevie and, again, I’m that guy from Brooklyn, I’m working in New York.  I just got out to California.  Let me tell you about recording studios.  I remember that Elliot Scheiner , that throwback to that story where he had the girl.  You don’t meet girls in a recording studio.  You know what I mean?  You just don’t.  It’s not Studio 54.  It’s a record playing studio.  

RR:	Everybody’s there to work and you’re focused on . . .

JI:	So girls are like some other thing that maybe I could figure that out some day.

RR:	Yeah, yeah, but it wasn’t going to happen where you were working.  

JI:	It wasn’t going to happen anyway.  I was 26 years old.  I remember I had girlfriends growing up and stuff.  I had a few girlfriends here and there, but I was just trying to learn how to make records.  

RR:	And you were very driven.  It sounds like you were very, very driven.

JI:	I was very driven until the day I retired and that’s why I retired.  I didn’t want to be driven anymore.  It was a conscious thing.  So now I start going out with Stevie.  How does that happen?  I don’t know.  I’d have to ask her.  Now Stevie moves into my house and I’m producing Tom.  And you know Tom.  He don’t wanna hear that your attention is some place else.

RR:	Ever, about anything.

JI:	Anything ever.  So I had a house in Sherman Oaks.  He was coming over one day.  I said look, Stevie . . . it was upside down.  You gotta hide in the basement.  Look, just stay down there, have tea and toast.  And Tom came over and she was hiding in the fucking basement.  She hears us playing.  She always talks about it.  She had her ear to the door.  But you know, I was very clumsy and I didn’t know how to do anything socially.  Anything.  So incompetent outside a recording studio.  I only felt safe in a recording studio.  I don’t know if you know that feeling, you must.  

RR:	Yeah.

JI:	I only felt like I was in water as a fish in the control room.  Outside of that, I was flopping around.  You know, when I did Belladonna, which turned out to be an incredible album.  That was the first album . . . you know Patti Smith had a band.  We did Easter, but she had a band.  When you have a band, a lot of the arrangements come built in.  You work on stuff, but the arrangements are pretty much . . .

RR:	How they play it.

JI:	How they play it, right.  Stevie was a particular challenge.  I think you’d be interested in this.  It was a real challenge and the reason why it was a challenge is she’s coming out of Fleetwood Mac.  That’s like coming out of The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, and they have three incredible singers and three incredible writers.  I had friends of mine say to me, I think you’re making a mistake, I’m not sure she can sing a whole album.

RR:	Yeah, because she never did before.  She sang on the whole album, but was never the focus.  

JI:	That was the first time I realized that conventional wisdom lead to conceptual blindness.  

RR:	Yes.

JI:	So the conventional wisdom was she sang three songs.  Now, she doesn’t have a band, she has the two girl singers who were her best friends and I gotta go create a sound for her because she’s a very simple writer on the piano.  But that voice and the melodies and the words are just unbelievable, but I still feel responsible to help put a sound together.  I came from bands, I didn’t want to put a sound together like Linda Ronstadt or those L. A. records that were great records, but they weren’t The Stones, it wasn’t Tom Petty, it wasn’t Patti Smith.

RR:	It didn’t sound like a band, it sounded like a backing tract with a singer.

JI:	Because they had that guitar player that only sounds like the guy, Campbell or only sounds like Keith.  Or Bruce’s band.  

RR:	It sounds like the Wrecking Crew.

JI:	Right.  Roy Bittan, right?  They’re not on every record.  

RR:	So you wanted the band to have personality too.

JI:	Right.  So what I did was, which I felt was a giant leap for me intellectually, I went out and I got guys from every band.  So I got Roy Bittan from E Street Band, I got Benmont Tench from the Heartbreakers, I got Don Felder and Davey Johnstone from the Eagles and Elton John, and I brought in Linda’s drum crew, Keltner and Bob Glaub.  

RR:	Incredible!

JI:	Right?!  And Waddy Wachtel.  So three guitar players, two keyboard players, Davey Johnstone.  I only wanted him to play that 12-string guitar.  If you ever heard him play that . . . if he’s ever around, I think he’s still around and you gotta do a record.  Nothing sounds like Davey Johnstone on a 12-string guitar.  Nothing.  He’s just . . . So you put Roy Bittan, Benmont Tench and Davey Johnstone, now you’ve got an orchestra.  Those three guys sound like nothing else together that anyone’s ever heard.  And every one of them is as unique sounding as any of the great rock and roll band musicians in the world.  Right?  So that gelled like crazy and then we were able to make that record.  

So if you listen to a song like Edge of Seventeen, now Stevie wrote that over a Police song.  It was a beginning of loops.  So she made a 16 bar loop of a Police song, Bring on the Night or something like that.  And she sang.  The White Winged Dove section was 16 minutes in, so we had to spend three days playing it and piecing it together.  If you listen to it, the bass drum in the verse . . . because the Police played like a reggae kind of feel.  So the bass drummer’s on the end.  And the way I used to record, I would stand in the middle of the room, not the control room, in the studio room.

RR:	In the live room?

JI:	Yeah, with headphones on because I wanted to work with the band, so I don’t know, that was the first album that I actually was a gigantic part of the arrangement.  Because I had to be.  

RR:	Yeah, yeah because it wasn’t a self-contained thing.  You had to build it.  

JI:	But I didn’t want to make a studio album with her.  It was so clear in my mind not to do that.  

RR:	So cool.

JI:	It was just a good idea, right?  

RR:	Absolutely.

JI:	I know.

RR:	That’s what it always comes down to.  It’s a good idea, you don’t even know where it comes from.  It’s just an inclination.

JI:	And you don’t know how to do it.  So I just figured I’m going to go with the horses that got me here; Roy Bittan, Benmont.  I love Davey Johnstone when he used to play with Elton.  

JI:	How great is Benmont?

JI:	Forget it!

RR:	It’s unbelievable.  

(1 hour, 30 minutes)

JI:	He’s pure soul.  If you listen to him on Damn the Torpedoes . . . that’s an interesting thing I’ll tell you, because you produced that band.  So when I was making Born to Run and I’m mixing it; remember, none of us knew how to make a record; me, John Landau, or Bruce.  But I had to mix it.  I never mixed an album before.  So I thought when you mix an album, that you have to hear every instrument.  So if you get a chance, listen to Born to Run and you realize how complex those arrangements, those chord changes.  The band’s playing a million different parts, so I was there just trying to get . . . I thought you had . . . I thought the rules were you had to hear every instrument.  So just sat that until you could hear every instrument.

But whenever I got  . . . I get bored really quick.  I think most record producers and DJ’s . .  . like a DJ gets bored because he’s looking at the audience and he’s bored before they’re bored, so he changes the song.  Everybody goes, oh, I’m so glad he changed the song.  It’s just that he was bored five second before you.  And that’s the way I am mixing.  If I’m mixing a record, I gotta do something.  But again, I quit producing when digital came out because I liked analog mixing.  I only could do it if I’m pushing everything up around myself.  So whenever I got in trouble on Born to Run, I’d go to Roy Bittan.  And no shame, every time you go to him, you push the goddam thing up and he’s doing something . . .

RR:	Something good happens.

JI:	Something great.  He’s never not playing something great.  So when I went to the Heartbreakers, I said I’ll push Benmont up.  If you listen that album, that organ is loud.  

RR:	I’m going to listen to the album with this mind.  I’ve listened to it a million times . . .

JI:	It’s loud.  It’s loud.  And you know what else is loud?  Because I used to argue with Stan the drummer a lot because to me, he’s a great drummer, but to me . . . he plays on the back end of the beat and it would always drive me crazy.  Because I was trying to make Roads and Bridges.  So I was thinking of drums like Max and Keltner, and this drummer’s like a loping kind of thing and he used to drive me crazy.  The guy who saved the day to me, and probably didn’t save the day for the world or for Tom Petty, but we’re mixing the album and Jim Keltner is working next door.  We’re mixing the album at Cherokee.  Sticks his head and he goes . . . knew me from John Lennon, right?  Hey, Jim, how’re you doing?  I said Jim, I’m doing a great.  He headache a film can in his hand, a little film can.  He goes listen, this is what this . . . it’s Refugee . . . he says this is what this song needs.  (making sound like a chicka-chicka-chicka).  I said would you go play it now?  And he went out and played it.  And I said put all the other songs up.  We put the fucking shaker on everything.  

RR:	It just glued everything together.  

JI:	When you hear the album, the fucking shaker is so loud.  And it made Stan work to me.  Now Stan is incredible, the sound of the drums is unbelieved.  But that shaker saved the day.

RR:	That’s amazing.  I gotta pee again.

JI:	Go man.  I want you to know I’m 10 years older than you and I haven’t peed yet.  Just for the record.

RR:	Yeah, but I’m also drinking a lot.  I’ve already had five coffees today.  Five double espressos.  You drink coffee?

JI:	No, I don’t drink caffeine anymore.  

RR:	Do you feel better since?

JI:	Oh, so much better.  More energy, everything.  

(a minute or two of quiet)

JI:	We may have to do another session.

RR:	We’ll go as long as you want to go.

JI:	I mean we’re not even at fucking . . .

RR:	Maybe we have to do five sessions.

JI:	Is that okay?

RR:	Absolutely.   I love learning about this stuff and thing is with the history, it’s like if we don’t capture the history, it’s gone.

JI:	I know, that’s why I love what you’re doing.  Can I stay till 4:30?  Is that okay?  That’s another hour.  Great.

RR:	We’ll definitely do a part 2, as many as it takes.

JI:	Yeah, to get it right.  

RR:	To get it right because it’s good.  It’s posterity.

JI:	Yeah, I love what you’re doing with this stuff.  Who’s it with?  Spotify?

RR:	Don’t even know, I’m just making ‘em.  

JI:	But I heard that there’s some out.

RR:	I’ve done five years of Broken Record . . . 

JI:	I’m gonna open that door.  Five years of what?

RR:	 Of Broken . . . if you unplug that heater, it’ll also help.  I think that heater is what’s making it hot.  Just turn that off.  The door’s just . . . you can open it, but it’s going to swing closed by itself.  You want me to open the back one?  That’s good.  There’s actually a door – do you see that doorstop thing?  

JI:	Anyway, so yeah.  

RR:	I can’t believe nobody recorded Chuck Berry when he was older.  Nobody recorded  . . .

JI:	What you’re doing here . . . who have you done so far?

RR:	Oh, I’ve been doing five years of Broken Record podcasts where I only talk to musicians.  So I did Bruce, I did Neil Young, I did everybody.  Great.  It’s great.  

JI:	It’s on Apple, right?

RR:	It’s on everything.  It’s Broken Record podcast, you can find it on Apple, Spotify, you can find it anywhere, it’s everywhere.  And I realized I’m interested in a lot of things besides music.  I like artists, I like directors, it’s interesting.  We like creative people.  So now I’m opening it up.  I recorded with Will Smith yesterday.  Incredible.  First big interview he did since the incident.  Was great.  

JI:	Have you heard the Chris Rock show?

RR:	No.  

JI:	I did.  It’s coming on Saturday.  Man, he goes in.  

RR:	I can’t wait.  I saw him in London perform maybe  . . .

JI:	He touches on it right?  

RR:	Yeah, yeah, yeah like four or five months ago.

JI:	I saw him three times in America, he did three different Will Smith things.  He goes there.  

RR:	He’s amazing.  He’s so funny.

JI:	He’s my favorite.  Him and David Chappelle are like . . .

RR:	The best.  And they’re so different and both so great.  Pull your mic closer.

JI:	The Will Smith thing, man.  He’s such a nice guy, but I don’t know.  That a big mistake.

RR:	It was crazy.  I told him it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen in my life on television.

JI:	I know.  Anybody’s ever seen.

RR:	I never saw anything like it.  It was a surreal moment.  I couldn’t tell if it was take or not because it was too much.

JI:	You guys talked about it?

RR:	Yeah.  It was interesting.  I’ll send you the episode as soon as it’s edited.

JI:	Oh, you’re gonna put it out?

RR:	Absolutely.  It was for this!  So I’m saying I interviewed Will Smith for the first one of the non-music ones because we really talked about Will Smith the actor, and then I’m doing Phil Jackson on Monday.  Very interesting people.  And I thought Jimmy’d be great.  So that’s how it happened.  I’ve been doing it for a long time, but only with musicians.  

JI:	Okay, let’s keep going.  Stevie Nicks?

(1 hour, 40 minutes)

RR:	The last story you told was the shaker.

JI:	So now we’re doing an album and I always tell this story because it’s important to show things you got wrong, as well as things you got right.

RR:	Of course.

JI:	So we’re doing Belladonna and I feel, even though we had Edge of Seventeen, but I didn’t know what Edge of Seventeen was.  I realize now, 40 years later, that it’s one of Stevie’s favorite songs that people have done.  I don’t know how you feel about that, but it’s really . . . it’s incredible.  Like Trent Reznor loves that song.  People that I never knew likes it.  So Tom had a song, which was Stop Dragging My Heart Around that we weren’t going to use because it was like a blues song.  Now remember, my mind with Tom was making hits.  That’s what I thought we did.  We made hits.  I consider music, you could have a credible song, a moody credible song, and you could have a hit song.  But when you put them together, that’s what you really want.  It’s My Life by the Animals, Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones, Light My Fire by The Doors, We Gotta Get Out of This Place by The Animals.  Foxy Lady.  I want those records that come together in a mass appeal, but also give me . . . Sympathy for the Devil.

RR:	The real deal.  The forever ones.  Absolutely.

JI:	So Tom singing Stop Dragging wasn’t a hit, so I said let’s give it to Stevie.  Because I’d just done this with Bruce with Patti Smit and Because the Night.  

RR:	What a great song Because the Night is.  That’s a great song.

JI:	Bruce didn’t want to use it.  The record is spectacular.  It’s the first record I ever produced.

RR:	That’s incredible.  It’s a beautiful one.

JI:	The drums on that were something Shelly (Ackerson) and I … we just started working together and that was the first thing we did.  He was an engineer at the studio and so was I, but I became a producer, but I wanted to have an engineer.

RR:	Yeah, so you could be free.

JI:	We started mixing it at midnight until 10 in the morning.  

RR:	Let’s listen to it a little bit.  It’s just good.

JI:	It’s really . . .

RR:	I found that when we listen to things when we’re talking about them, it sparks different thoughts.  

(Because the Night starts playing)

RR:	Great piano part.

JI:	It’s Roy, not it’s not Roy, Roy wrote the piano part.

RR:	Great piano part.

(song continues, and then stops)

RR:	It’s incredible and she sings it great.  She owns the song.

JI:	And I don’t know why, but I just heard her on that song.

RR:	Not an obvious fit.

JI:	No.  Bruce wasn’t using it.  It was thrown away.  I said to him, are you throwing the song away?  He said absolutely.  

RR:	Bruce throws away a lot of songs.  He write a lot.

JI:	He wrote that and Fire at the same time, and gave them both away.  Gave one to Robert Johnson.  We’ll talk about him because that’s where I learned a real work ethic with Springsteen.  I learned that you don’t stop until you get it.  Bruce said something brilliant, said many things brilliant, but he said I didn’t want to be rich, I didn’t want to be famous, I didn’t even want to be happy, I wanted to be great.  And that’s what he’s like.

RR:	And he is, and he is.

JI:	 And in those studios at that time, he was broke.  And we were all struggling.  And he just kept us all there until . . . I remember one night we’re mixing She’s the One and, you know what happens, my ears clogged up, but we only had nine days to mix eight songs, so I couldn’t stop.  Remember, he was getting dropped from Sony.

RR:	I didn’t know that.  I didn’t know any of this.  Let’s say we’ll talk about Bruce B.  That’s unbelievable.  

JI:	Oh yeah, yeah.  That was it.  But anyway, so Tom . . . we got her the song, he sang on it and then I didn’t know how it worked and Atlantic dropped the record right on top of his record.  

RR:	So basically Stevie’s record steps on The Waiting?  

JI:	That’s right.  That’s right.

RR:	That’s unbelievable.  That’s bad luck.  Think it was just the way the cards went?

JI:	I think the label got hungry, wanted to have a hit, and those days nobody gave a fuck.  They hated the other labels.  

RR:	Tom gave a fuck.

JI:	Yeah, big time.  And I felt responsible.  I think  . . . I always felt, because we were related.  We were related and you know, as years went on, I always thought, you know, I should have protected him somehow, but I didn’t even know you could do that.  But yet, you know it’s like saying somebody’s ahead of their time.  I never want to hear that.  They say, Jimmy you’re ahead of your time.  No I wasn’t, I just didn’t get it right.  I don’t care that I had the idea before anybody else, I care that I didn’t do it.  So I felt that I should have done something different to make the result some out different.  Although when I go back . . .

RR:	It wasn’t in your control.  That’s the part of it . . .

JI:	You know something, Rick?  There was something I was when I was younger that I got under control, and I really have it under control as I got older.  I was too hungry.  You make those kinds of mistakes when you’re too hungry.  You just push it.

RR:	Short sighted.

JI:	Yeah, and you really . . . we’ll get into this when we talk about Bruce because I learned a lot from Bruce on that too.  But yeah, I felt I made a great record, but although The Waiting is one of Tom’s best songs.

RR:	Absolutely.

JI:	But there was something it that wasn’t as commercial as Refugee.  Do I know why?

RR:	No.

JI:	No.

RR:	You never know.

JI:	No.  All I knew was I played it for somebody I really respected before it came out.  I played it for Richard Perry.  He said this is not as big as the last album.  I was devastated.  Because I wore the same jeans as the last album.

RR:	You were into stuff like that?

JI:	To a point of psychosis.  Every studio, same assistant.  Everything had to be exactly the same because I wanted . . .

RR:	The same results.

JI:	Yeah.

RR:	And you don’t know what it is.  Maybe it’s the lucky pants.

JI:	Right, could be, right?

RR:	Could be.  Could be anything.  And that was something you could control.  The pants.  That’s the beauty of it.  If you know if I do everything that I could possibly do, it’s certainly not going to hurt my odds.

(1 hour, 50 minutes)

JI:	And I felt he wrote the songs, which he did, but there’s something about . . . I don’t know, maybe you’ve done albums with somebody where the follow up just didn’t match up or something.  You felt you had it but the world thought you didn’t.

RR:	Also sometimes it’s where the artist is at.  I had that experience with Tom.  I made great albums with Tom and I made less great albums with Tom too, based on where he was at.  Do you know, it’s like not everyone is great all the time forever.  And you don’t stop.  You don’t just stop.

JI:	But the magic of a record is so fucking complex that no one gets it.  People use music as chewing gum, especially now.  They have no idea where it comes from, how it comes.  If you make a classic movie, people dissect it.  They don’t dissect records, they just take it, okay, next.  That always felt like . . . I learned a lesson there and I became . . 

RR:	But it was not in your control.  I mean you feel bad and you wish there was something you could have done.

JI:	It was because Hard Promises was so important to me, but . . .

RR:	Did Tom call you or talk about it?

JI:	What Tom said one day, which really got to me, so I’m on the road and three months in they’re asking me to sign Damn the Torpedoes.  I mean it sold millions of albums and everything, but it didn’t matter.  The Waiting and Woman in Love weren’t big hit records.  

RR:	I remember going to the record store, the childhood record store that I went to called TSS, Times Square Store, which was a big box store that sold everything, but there was a record department and that was my record department growing up on Long Island where I went to buy records.  I remember seeing the cover of Damn the Torpedoes every time I went to the record store.  It was always . . . there was this back wall where they put like the important records.  There were stacks of records everywhere, but on the back wall where you could see the coves, Damn the Torpedoes was always there.  

JI:	Now we’re getting into clothes again.  I bought him that sport jacket.

RR:	Wow.  Good look!  

JI:	It was a great look.  

RR:	I think Hard Promises had a cool cover too.  

JI:	Yeah, yeah, it was in a record store.  I think.  I get Long After Dark and Hard Promises mixed up.  You want to listen to a great Tom Petty record?  I think I told you this once before.  Play Rebels.  

RR:	Okay, I’ll listen to it right now.

JI:	It is an incredible, incredible record.  Which is an interesting story about that album.  Did you ever listen to Rebels?  

RR:	I never have.

JI:	Oh my God.  Listen to it on big speakers someday. It’s fucking incredible.  

RR:	I’m sure I’ve listened to it because it has Southern Accents on it.  Of course.  Did you ever hear the Johnny Cash version of Southern Accents.

JI:	Rick Rubin, I listen to every song you did with Johnny Cash.  Over the last two weeks, I just brought up fucking Danny Boy.  Okay?  I’ve listened to every fucking song.  I mean my wife wants to kill me.  She loves Johnny Cash, but enough’s . . .

RR:	Yeah, enough’s enough.  

JI:	I just play it constantly.  

RR:	And some of them are really sad.  It’s heavy.  Those albums can make me cry.

JI:	I think they have to go back, they should go back on the Grammy’s and give Albums we Missed.  

RR:	That’s a good idea.  I feel like the Grammy’s are obsolete.

JI:	I know that.  But Howard, what’s his name, the producer, great guy.  Harvey.  He’s trying to do better.  They are obsolete.  I mean every album I just mentioned didn’t win a Grammy.  Or Born to Run.  Damn the Torpedoes.  None of them got.  Belladonna, none of them got Grammy’s.  

RR:	It’s always a disconnect between what’s popular and then what’s critically . . . there’s almost like two different . . .

JI:	One’s conventional wisdom.  They want to go with what they know.  And if you’re doing something a little ahead of the time.

RR:	And the best one has no point of reference.  It’s revolutionary and they don’t understand that.

JI:	I mean Led Zeppelin IV didn’t get Album of the Year.

RR:	It’s amazing, right?

JI:	How the fuck does anything else . . .you can stop right there.  But they should have a category of the One We Missed.  Or the ones we missed, they give five a year.

RR:	It would be beautiful.

JI:	I’m gonna tell Harvey that.  Do it on a night and just have those five albums.  There are so many of them, my God.

RR:	Do you think it’s possible for people to care about music in the same way, considering the fact that it’s going by the way it’s going by.  Do you know what I’m saying?  Since the streaming revolution, our relationship to music has changed where even the things we love, they’re still things on this conveyor belt that are going by all the time.

JI:	One of the big problems . . . I’ve done a lot of thinking about this because I had a streaming service, I had a record company, right?  And I study popular culture, that’s what I do.  I try to impact popular culture whenever I can or be part of something that’s impacting popular culture.  So what’s happening now is kids have so much . . . videos games, there’s so much shit including themselves, so not only do they have their schoolwork, but they’re trying to get likes and looking at their friends likes.  You can’t do that while listening to music.  

RR:	Not while really listening to music the way we listened to music.

JI:	So take a kid and you . . . how old is your kid now?

RR:	Six.

JI:	In three years, say, you know what, you missed your homework, you’re only allowed two apps.  One of them’s not a streaming music service.  YouTube.  TikTok.  Music is fifth.  It’s not the thing.  And it also affects . . . what happened, Rick, is that fame has replaced great as a currency.  When you were growing up, great was the currency.  Even if you were a pop band, you were trying to be better than the other pop band.  Now it’s you wanna be more famous.  You don’t have to repeat great, Instagram is going to keep you around and keep you making money whether you make a great album for your second album or not.  You see it all the time.  There are artists out there that have just average albums after they come out, and they’re bigger.  They get television shows, they get on The Voice or this or that.  It doesn’t matter anymore.  Because fame has replaced great, in my opinion.

RR:	It’s interesting.  

JI:	It’s a famous currency.  It’s currency.  That’s the currency.  It used to be you had to be great to be famous.  Or have a hit or something.  You don’t have to have a hit to be famous.  Not even  . . .

RR:	Not even a little bit.

JI:	You don’t have to do anything.  So that’s when you ask me, people go so listen, the answer to that is unless someone figures out a hurricane way of reintroducing music, which somebody will, to make it . . . hip hop’s 50 years old.  You know what I mean?

RR:	Hip hop is 50 years old?

JI:	Right.  So you need another something.  Right?  

RR:	Hip hop was the last big movement?

JI:	Yeah.

RR:	I guess so.

JI:	Yeah, it was after punk.  It was after disco.

RR:	EDM?

JI:	Never got quite as big as hip hop.  It didn’t change the way people dress, EDM.  Punk changed that, rock and roll, and disco.  EDM.  I mean it’s popular . . .

RR:	Amazing the impact disco had because it was a short window.  There were only a couple of years of disco. 

JI:	Because it burned.

RR:	But it was great.

JI:	It burnt.

RR:	Because it got too big too fast?  Or just too much.

JI:	It just got burnt.

RR:	I guess maybe that could have happened to hip hop too, but hip hop keeps reinventing itself.

JI:	Oh no, disco didn’t.  But guys like us go back and listen to Saturday Night Fever, that fucking album, the Bee Gees.  They were . . . 

RR:	Unbelievable.

JI:	UNBELIEVABLE!  What record makers.  And they were scorned.  They were scorned.

RR:	I interviewed Barry Gibb.  It was great.  He was so interesting.  So cool, so smart.  

JI:	I bet.  You know another guy who’s really good?  You know him well.  Is Jeff Lynne.

RR:	Yeah, unbelievable talent.  Unbelievable.

JI:	I thought . . . when I heard him put those backing vocals on Free Falling, it was one of those, why didn’t I think of that moments.  I heard him . . . I said oh fuck, he put ELO’s vocals on Tom Petty and it worked.  

RR:	And the songs were so good on that album.

JI:	I mixed Evil Woman.

RR:	Every song on that album was great.  The album with Free Falling.  

JI:	It’s funny, Tom did his three best albums with three different producers; Wildflowers, is it Full Moon Fever and Damn the Torpedoes.  

RR:	And in each case, it was the first album.  I always felt like, when I worked with Tom the first time, he really wanted to show me how good he was.  And after that, I don’t think he cared.  He cared about making the best stuff . . . he cared about making it as good as he could and doing what he wanted, but he didn’t have that feeling like I want to impress this guy.

JI:	It was magic when we first got together, but then like anything else . . . I did three albums with him.  I also did half of Southern Accents.  I brought, which it gave Tom his comeback, Don’t Come Around Here No More, because he was kinda cold.  But it also messed up Southern Accents because Southern Accents was a theme album, but without Don’t Come Around Here No More on it, it’s not . . . he doesn’t get on MTV.  

RR:	Yeah, that was the step into the future.  It was programmed, it was different.  

JI:	It was Dave.  Of course I got that song for Stevie.  I heard the Eurythmics.  I said oh fuck this.  I went down to Dave’s concert, the first time he played in L.A.  I brought him to Stevie’s house and he played me that drum beat, and he just was singing himself, Don’t Come Around Here No more.  I said holy shit, Stevie Nicks singing Don’t Come Around No More.  That has to win.  So she, as Dave would say, she was starting sing Shakespeare over the versus, right?  So Dave says it’s not working.  I said let me tell you something, Tom would write the shit out of this.

RR:	You got Tom back!  Tom got it back.  Amazing.  

JI:	You got it.  But no one ever mentions that, including Tom.  

RR:	That’s amazing.

JI:	It’s funny.  No one knows this story.  So Tom comes in and he’s writing it, and he goes I’m gonna take this one.  I said great and Stevie didn’t care one way or the other, and Tom got Don’t Come Around Here No More and it completely reenergized Tom’s career.  And Stevie’s singing background on it.  Those are great stories, aren’t they?  

RR:	Amazing.  And all stuff you can’t plan.  

JI:	No, no, no.  Record producers have to be spontaneous.  How do you feel about producing records these days?  You still enjoy it?

RR:	It’s fun.  It’s fun because it goes from something that either you don’t know what it is or it’s not so good, and you watch . . . I feel like I have no control over the situation, I’m not doing anything, but we’re playing and trying things.  Let’s try it like this, let’s try it like this, let’s try it like this.  And then all of a sudden something happens and you can’t believe it.  How that transformation of holy smokes.  I think I’m addicted to that experience of I can’t believe this is as good as it is.  I just listened to the master of album that I’ve been working on for a little bit, that’s coming out.

JI:	Whose is it?

RR:	Kesha.  

JI:	Ohh.  You are a controversial guy.  You don’t care.  Isn’t that the one that had the thing with Dr. Luke and all that.  

RR:	I don’t even know.  I don’t get into any backstory.  

JI:	I don’t know anything about it.  Is she any good?

RR:	She’s incredible.  This is an album unlike anything she’s ever done and it’s so personal and so real.  I love it.  I listened to it today and I thought my head was going to explode it was so exciting.

JI:	You know who you should produce?  Or you did Lana Del Rey?  

RR:	Of course, she’s amazing.  I only did one song with her.  I love her.  She’s on my list of people for us to talk about.

JI:	Man, she’s awesome.

RR:	She’s great.  She’s no unique.  She’s just Lana.  It’s so funny, I played Lana for Kesha in the studio, just to talk about lyrics.  Like listen to this.  Listen to how  . . . she can take something and make what sounds like a regular song so emotional and so impactful.

JI:	To me she does to songs what Quinto Tarantino does to movies.  It looks like a regular movie, but it’s not.  

RR:	I love Quinton Tarantino.  His last movie I think is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen in my life.  

JI:	He’s something else, man.

RR:	It’s something else.  

JI:	The think about producing, I could never go in again, but I would have to do it with somebody that’s making their best work.  It’s had to do that with somebody who’s older.  You did it, Daniel Lanois with Bob Dylan.  That record, man.  That record is awesome.  Just awesome.

RR:	There’s one even after that, a couple after that that I think Bob made himself called Modern Times.  That’s post Daniel Lanois . . . a couple post.  I remember going to Petty’s house.  So I heard it and it blew my mind.  I was at a point where I wasn’t necessarily thinking the new Dylan album’s gonna be the greatest thing because they’re hit and miss.  And I went to Tom’s house, and I said you gotta hear this.

JI:	When’s the last time you saw Tom?

RR:	I saw him on the beach in Malibu probably a year before he passed and I was invited and planned on going to see him at the Hollywood Bowl, which was one of his last shows, maybe his last show, and I just felt like I don’t really want to drive in.  

JI:	Rick, you’re freaking me out.

RR:	Same?

JI:	I was in Malibu.  Rick, I had . . .

RR:	How could we leave the house?  I love Tom, I want to see him.  We’re gonna drive there, the parking.  

JI:	Rick, Rick.  This is so weird for me.  I had the tickets, I had the people meeting me backstage, I had everything.  And it was 6 o’clock on a Sunday in Malibu and I said I gotta drive to the fucking Hollywood Bowl?  And ‘til today I feel so shitty about not going.  

RR:	I have a different opinion.  

JI:	I’d like to get your opinion.  

RR:	I feel like we weren’t supposed to see him that night.  That’s what it is.  We were not supposed to see him that night.  And it worked out exactly the way it was supposed to.  Because otherwise we’d a been there.  

JI:	Then Stevie called me on the day it happened and just said come over here right away.  I said I heard he died.  

RR:	How could it be?

JI:	Huh?

RR:	It just seemed to outta the blue . . . like farfetched.  

JI:	I mean you knew him better in the later years than I did.  I didn’t see him that much, although he did do The Defiant Ones for me, which was really sweet and he was great.  But I heard that the thing at the house and everything, his environment was not great.  That’s what I heard.  I don’t know the truth.  

RR:	I don’t know.

JI:	Because I talked to Adria a lot while that was going on.  I went to see him when he was on life support.  It was weird.  I walk in there, I think it was St. John’s or UCLA in Santa Monica.  Stevie’s there, and I walk up and I go and I look in this room, and Tom’s hooked up to the machine.  (makes sound like respirator)  He was done, they just hadn’t unplugged him yet.  So I whispered something in his ear.  I walked outside and I saw Elliot Roberts and Tony Dimitriadis, and the band, and for the first time in my life I said, so this is what it’s gonna look like.  You know what I mean?  My friends will be here.

RR:	Yeah, this is what happens to everybody.  This is how it goes.  

JI:	I’m working right now, I think you’ll appreciate this.  I’m working right now with UCLA.  I’ve been working on it for two years and I’ve got some real backers about building a hospital.  

RR:	Amazing.

JI:	In Malibu.

RR:	Great.  We need one.  

JI:	Desperately.  Let me tell you something, you get a stroke, you’re dead.  I hope you really enjoyed Malibu because it’s going to kill you at that moment.  So we’re trying to put a trauma center where they can deal with heart attack and stroke.  And stabilize you until they can get you to UCLA.  It’s gonna have two trucks.  Laurene Jobs is involved.  The guy that bought the house on my bluff.  He did What’s App.

RR:	I don’t know. 

JI:	You guys are all friends of (Veve), but everybody’s a friend a Veve.  By the way, are you coming Saturday night?

RR:	I hope so.  Again, it’s like you heard the Petty story.  

JI:	Well let me tell you why you have to come.  It’s vinyl night.  Jimmy Jam’s coming.  L. A. Reid is coming.  Trent is coming.  Eminem is coming.  And we’re gonna play vinyl.  

RR:	Amazing.  What time is it really gonna happen?

JI:	8 o’clock.

RR:	8 o’clock?

JI:	I gotta go to bed by midnight.  

RR:	I go to sleep at 9!  I mean I’m in bed . . .

JI:	Okay, I go to bed at 9:30.  But if I didn’t think this was gonna be so cool musically, I got Battlecat.  Gonna be dropping the vinyl.  I have couches, like a big vinyl room.   I created this room.  On the ground . . . this sounds ridiculous.  We have a roller skating rink underground.  I’m turning it into this vinyl room and I’m bringing in . . .

RR:	Do you listen to vinyl all the time now?

JI:	Yeah.

RR:	That’s great.  

JI:	I have vinyl night.  You haven’t been around.  

RR:	I know, I’m never around.  I’m never here.  I like being in other places . . . I feel like I’ve done this and now my experiences are in other parts of the world and I’m loving that.

JI:	That’s fantastic. 

RR:	What’s the first time you went to Italy?

JI:	I went to Italy . . . the first time I ever did anything was with a musician.  I went to Italy with Bono.  I went to one of his shows in Rome.  But I go to Italy all the time now.  We rented an island there two years in a row called Li Galli.  

RR:	I know Li Galli.  Fantastic.  I’ve been.  

JI:	I rented that island twice.  Now we rent a peninsula in Greece.  

RR:	I’ve never been to Greece.  Great?

JI:	It’s not quite Italy, but the place that we got is even better than the island.  But yeah.

RR:	Li Galli is magnificent.  I remember the first time I went there just feeling like I can’t believe anybody lives like this.  This is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been in my life.  

JI:	We stay there three weeks at a time.  We had our friends come in, visit us.  You know what we do, is we rent a boat, but like a 75 foot boat and we go to all the islands and Capri and all that.  Magnificent.  In Greece we do the same thing.  It’s really fantastic.  But that’s the night Tom Petty . . . that’s what I was . . . let me tell you, it’s very possible if there was a hospital in Malibu, he would have been able to go rather than getting those drugs, wherever the fuck he got the Fentanyl from.  He may have been able to just go there to an emergency room and say my hip hurts.  He’d be alive today.  Right?  The reason why he’s dead is he didn’t want to go to fucking UCLA.

RR:	And supposedly I think the story with Prince is similar.

JI:	Yeah, it’s very similar.  Both Fentanyl.  Both hips.

RR:	And pain.  Excruciating pain.  

JI:	Then there’s all these rumors about where they get the drug from, was it real.  

RR:	It wasn’t Fentanyl, but Michael Jackson too.  Same story.  

JI:	What are you going to do, right?  We got so much to talk about.

RR:	I love talking to you.  It’s a pleasure hearing you share the wisdom of the life.  It’s like no one else can tell the story but you.  

JI:	You know, Rick, this is where I am now.  Five years ago I retired, right?  I retired because I couldn’t work the way I worked and live the life I wanted to life.  I wasn’t able to do what you’re doing.  I’m gonna work, but I’m gonna go to Italy for three weeks.  If I was in Italy for three weeks, I was thinking about the fucking guitar or whatever today’s guitar part was.  The headphones, Apple music, we’re gonna win, lose, draw.  So I had to quit.

RR:	I understand.  I wonder if I could ever bring myself to that.  It’s interesting.  It’s inspirational to hear it.

JI:	I did it at 65 and I’ll tell you why.  I think you could feel it in me.  I’m a different Circadian rhythm.  I’m in a different space.

RR:	I feel it.  This is the most relaxed conversation I’ve ever had with you.

JI:	I just feel great.  I do things.  I help my wife with her roller skating rinks.  I help Jamie with network, I help my kids, I’m building high schools with Dre.  

RR:	You do what interests you, but you don’t feel like you’re on the hook.

JI:	The hook.  The word.  The hook isn’t in my mouth.  That’s the feeling.  

RR:	I understand.  I know the feeling.  

JI:	And you know what, I don’t want to have to convince people of anything anymore.  I don’t want to convince people on giant deals or making the tambourine a little louder.  I don’t want to convince anybody of anything.  If you want to play, we can play.  Ever since I retired, my medical numbers have gone through the roof.  I feel relaxed.  Me and my wife are doing great.  And my kids, look I’m gonna be 70.  I’m retired 5 years.  And you know something, this is not for the record, but I watch a guy like Iger, Bob, right.  He retired.  He had it.  Retired at the top of the class.  He went back.  I don’t know why he went back.  Now he’s fighting with Norman Peltz.  Why are you even talking to Norman Peltz.  Norman Peltz and he’s firing 6,000 people next week.  For what?  Because he missed it.  I don’t miss anything.  

RR:	I understand.

JI:	I don’t miss one fucking .  . . by the way, Bruce asked me when I retired.  He said how can you be retired.  I look man, I just left Italy with you.  I went to Milan.  80,000 people yelling Bruce.  If they were yelling Jimmy, I wouldn’t retire either.  

RR:	Yeah, it’s different.

JI:	I talk to scumbags all day.  And I don’t want to do that.  

RR:	I understand that.  That’s a big subject for our next talk about the people you have to deal with.

JI:	But I want to talk to you about Beats.  Why that happened.  And the record business.  Where it is.  I really feel that . . . one of the reasons I left Apple, not the reason, but one of the reasons is . . . and they can’t for a good reason, but I don’t believe streaming could work without social.  Without giving the artist direct communication with their fans.  Or be able to develop new fans.  You can’t even repost a song on Spotify.  So you gotta go to Instagram to promote yourself.  It should happen all in one place.  So Trent and I wanted Apple to buy Musical.ly which ByteDance bought and became TikTok.  If that was on Apple Music, now the record business is pumping and the artists are promoting themselves.  This is never gonna work until you can get artists to promote themselves, and give them the tools to do and give them the audience.  Letting them just go and create the whole world.  What Prince wanted originally.  Just to be able to be self-contained.  You could still have labels doing whatever they do, but artists have to be able to be self-contained and no one is giving them that tool.  No one.  That’s what Trent and I tried to do, but when I realized we weren’t going to do it, I just said let somebody else do it.

RR:	It’s a great idea to bring Trent in on that project.  That was a great idea.

JI:	I know.  I love that guy, man.

RR:	He’s amazing.  He’s a visionary.

JI:	He’s coming Saturday night.  Eminem, Trent and Dre are coming, and they go nowhere.  They go less places than you.  So you should come.

RR:	Anything’s possible.  It’s Saturday night.

JI:	Only because I want an excuse to play . . . I’m gonna play records by the people that are there.  Because what we do is we talk about the record and how we made it, and where we were when we met kids.  It’s really  . . . people don’t know that shit.  And it’s just . . . you gotta see how we’re setting it up.  We’re setting it up like a gigantic living room.  I want to play, one of your old records, but also the Johnny Cash thing because no one understands what that Johnny Cash record is.

RR:	You could play the one that Trent wrote and have him talk about it, which would be pretty cool.  I’ve never talked to him . . . .
