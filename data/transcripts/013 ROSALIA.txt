[00:00:07.280] - Speaker 2
Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:08.050] - Speaker 1
I want to start by thanking you so much for making such great music. Thanks to you. You've been inspiring me forever.

[00:00:32.070] - Speaker 2
But the music is like everyone is different. I try. To me, it feels like it keeps getting better. But the fact that it's different and that you have the confidence to follow what's inside, it's very inspiring not so many artists do. It's few and far between.

[00:00:48.340] - Speaker 1
Thank you so much. I try.

[00:00:50.570] - Speaker 2
You can hear it.

[00:00:52.150] - Speaker 1
I try always. That is different. That every time is different. I think that this is the only way that is real to every moment because every moment is different. We're changing all the time, right? I think that at the end of the day, music has to be a reflection of that, of every different stage in life that we are. I think that the project is going to be different, too. I think it's what's natural. I don't know. At least for me.

[00:01:18.800] - Speaker 2
I imagine your influences keep changing as time goes on as well.

[00:01:24.460] - Speaker 1
See, I think so.

[00:01:26.250] - Speaker 2
You get turned on to something new and it's exciting. I that when I hear new things, it gives me not so much that I want to do it what they do, but it allows a way of looking at things in a new way. It opens a new door for us to go through.

[00:01:43.650] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly.

[00:01:45.630] - Speaker 2
Tell me, describe the difference. The three albums are completely different, I would say. Tell me the process of each one. Start with the first.

[00:01:56.910] - Speaker 1
Wow, that's a very difficult question to answer because, again, I think each one represents a different moment. I think that the first one, if I'm not wrong, Los Angeles. It was 2017. I was in Barcelona. At that time, I think it was eight years that I was studying traditional flamenco. Then I think that what I learned with my master, Chiqui, I felt like I had to give it a shape, like a music shape, like a record shape. And then I just did that. Also, it's very demanding. Flamenco is so demanding. It requires a lot of focus on that and a lot of energy. So while I was studying that in college, I would do those recordings because it's what I would learn in college with my master. So I would be like, Yeah, okay, I learned this melody. Let me try to change this or that. Let me dress it different. Let me shape it different. But at the end of the day, those were the melodies that my master was teaching me. Basically, I met Refri, which is a great musician and a great producer. And then we just did that album. It just happened.

[00:03:17.070] - Speaker 1
We played one day, we played in this club, Elio Gabal in Barcelona, and then we just did that. It just happened.

[00:03:24.230] - Speaker 2
At that time, did you imagine you would be a traditional flamenco singer forever?

[00:03:30.120] - Speaker 1
I don't think so. I think it's part of who I am because that's my foundation. But I don't think that I'm just that because I feel like my life, I think it's dedicated to music to learning more music. I think that what I do, the projects that I do, a lot of times are about love letters to different styles, different music. I think that I would love that in the future it's like that, and it's been like that. I think it wouldn't be fidel.. I wouldn't be... No sería fiel Faithful? Yeah, faithful, exactly. To myself, if I would just decide to be one thing. There's people that maybe they are just one thing. Maybe, I don't know. In my case, though, I don't feel like that.

[00:04:31.380] - Speaker 2
Did you know music was going to be what you wanted to do forever or no?

[00:04:34.840] - Speaker 1
I think so, yeah.

[00:04:35.970] - Speaker 2
Always? Yeah.

[00:04:37.110] - Speaker 1
Since I was eight or nine years old, I decided I wanted to make music. I decided I wanted to be on stage, though, performing, but I didn't know I want to write or I want to produce, I want to make music. It was with time that happened later. But I always knew that I wanted to be a musician.

[00:04:57.120] - Speaker 2
Performer and a musician. A performer and a musician.

[00:04:59.540] - Speaker 1
Use voice, which I think is an instrument, maybe the first one, I don't know.

[00:05:04.440] - Speaker 2
What's the first time you sang in front of people?

[00:05:07.740] - Speaker 1
With my family. Yeah, I was eight years old, I think, or something. Seven, eight years old.

[00:05:16.610] - Speaker 2
What was the music that you would hear in your house growing up?

[00:05:20.610] - Speaker 1
The music that I would hear, it would be mainly rock. It would be Queen, Bob Dylan, Super Trump, Bob Marley, Johnny Joplin.

[00:05:38.260] - Speaker 2
Would that be your parents' music?

[00:05:40.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That would be what my parents would play on the car. My mom, when she was younger, she used to have a radio. Apparently, she said that. She would play records that she would like. I think she would always love David Bowie. She would always talk to me about Johnny or David Bowie or artists that she would like. I think my mom, she always loved music. My dad, too. He liked Bob Marley.

[00:06:07.320] - Speaker 2
What else did your dad like besides Bob Marley?

[00:06:09.350] - Speaker 1
He would like Queen. He liked Freddie Mercury. Rock? Yeah. They would listen mainly rock. That's why I think that when I was a teenager, I was like, I didn't want to do anything, I think, too close to that. I was more interested in electronic music. I wanted to do something different. The more I grow, it's crazy. The more I go back to that and the more my love grows for that music and those artists.

[00:06:38.280] - Speaker 2
For rock music?

[00:06:39.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:06:40.420] - Speaker 2
Do you think earlier it would be like rebelling against your parents to not do rock? Exactly. To have your own music.

[00:06:47.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think that Los Angeles has some touches because of the attitude that Raul has, or I would have in that energy, that moment, it makes sense for both of us to make it sound like that. But I think that at the same time I wanted to do El mal querer, which is more electronic, and it was otra propuesta, a different proposal. Yeah.

[00:07:12.750] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the world of music that you grew up in, outside of the house, what was the music? I don't know anything about Spain. I've been to Barcelona one time for- My city? I came to see the first show. It was a radiohead concert. The first show for Okay Computer was in a club in Barcelona, maybe about a thousand people. I came for that just because I loved them so much and I wanted to see it.

[00:07:44.770] - Speaker 1
You travel to Barcelona? Yeah. How did you like it?

[00:07:49.480] - Speaker 2
I was there for 48 hours. I was there enough to like it, but not enough to really know it.

[00:07:54.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, I need a little bit more time because it's really beautiful. I think it's a very beautiful I think it's very alive.

[00:08:01.560] - Speaker 2
Gaudi and architecture, fantastic.

[00:08:03.720] - Speaker 1
And the food, everything.

[00:08:06.600] - Speaker 2
I really love that place. Tell me about the music that was going on around. If you went out to listen to music, what would it be?

[00:08:14.560] - Speaker 1
When I was, for example, 17, 18, I was going to jam sessions. There would be a lot of flamenco or tablaos. There would be a lot of flamenco. There would be traditional music from there.

[00:08:29.800] - Speaker 2
Flamenco is popular in Barcelona still a main music, not like traditional folk music?

[00:08:38.710] - Speaker 1
It's hard to say because I think that it depends on where you move. For example, if you are in the street, it definitely sounds. It's a music that is part of the street. But then it depends. There's a lot of people that they love music that is more where people rap. There's a lot of that. I grew up with that, too, with my friends listening to music that would come from here. Definitely would be those two then. A lot of jam sessions, people would be rapping, people would be playing saxophone, people would be playing jazz, people would be playing Bosa Nova, so many styles. That's what I remember the most.

[00:09:24.550] - Speaker 2
Jam sessions with live instruments, people playing live.

[00:09:28.350] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. I would spend a lot of time studying in college or preparing to go to college or jam sessions. When I would go out, for me, it would be go out, I would go to those places, those clubs, those bars where we would just play music. I would study standards, then I would go and sing it. Even my English wasn't perfect. I would study flamenco, and then at some point in el tablao, they would say,, and then you would just sing. It would be every time different. There was this component of improvisation that I think if I learned something about improvisation, it was there. Or el where there would be jazz sessions.

[00:10:17.410] - Speaker 2
Makes sense. The first album is primarily, I'll call it a modern flamenco album, but primarily vocally flamenco, no?

[00:10:26.480] - Speaker 1
I mean, guitar and voice, mainly. Yeah, guitar and voice. I wanted that it was like that.

[00:10:32.280] - Speaker 2
An acoustic guitar and voice. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:10:34.500] - Speaker 1
.

[00:10:38.290] - Speaker 2
Then the second album sounds nothing like that.

[00:10:41.370] - Speaker 1
Yes, because it's crazy. But when I was 16, 17, also I would go to raves, and I would go to the club. That's how also my voice got damaged because of going out and smoking and drinking and singing loud on a Saturday when it's too late to be doing that. Then my voice got fucked up, and then I had to get surgery.

[00:11:03.870] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:11:04.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Then go through a process of recovering my voice. For a year, I couldn't sing anything, almost just recovering. Then for almost six years, between my 20 to 26, I would study with this woman, Dulceos Cortés. She would teach me arias. I would study that. Then I would get very interested with classical music, too. Yeah. All music.

[00:11:31.260] - Speaker 2
Are you studying it with the idea of, this is something I want to do professionally in terms of opera, or just I want to have this ability- The ability. For whatever you want to use it?

[00:11:43.410] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the ability to be able to use my voice with freedom. Just being able to do whatever I imagine, I would love to be able to do it with my voice. I think that I'm still on that path of how can I make my voice even freer. That's That's why I'm always interested in studying any style vocally.

[00:12:04.530] - Speaker 2
One of my favorite songs on the second album is, I guess it's a more flamenco-influenced lead vocal, but it has you singing like a soup behind it. Fourth song on the album.

[00:12:17.390] - Speaker 1
I don't know the names.. I think so. Yeah, I think so.

[00:12:25.810] - Speaker 2
It's a really good one. But again, it feels like the voice became Now the voice wasn't just the lead instrument, but it was the textural instrument as well. That was new compared to the first album in LA.

[00:12:39.280] - Speaker 1
I think that Pablo, El Guincho, had a lot of experience sampling doing samples. I think that his experience in that was so amazing and so.... That it really added to the process of executing this El Marquerer idea with somebody to me. He's the best one in my country doing samples, sampling. He's the best to me. I would listen a lot of electronic music. I would love James Blake. I would be obsessed with him. I would listen a lot of different electronic music, and I would be obsessed. I would be like, I want to do something with flamenco, with this style, with these melodies, but arranging it different and using colors that I don't think I have heard this way. That's why I did El Marquere.

[00:13:36.440] - Speaker 2
It's very modern-sounding, different, futuristic, and unlike anything I've heard before. This is another interesting good sign. When your second album came out, friends of mine, great musicians. If I said the names, great musicians that you like. Some were like, second album came out, and some of my friends were like, Oh, no. The first album was so great. It's like, what? Then when the third album came out, other friends were like, Oh, no, the second one was the good one. So I think you're on to something good when- That happens. Yeah, because then it's like people are trying to hold you in their minds in the past. And the fact that it keeps happening. And when I hear it, each one sounds like it's getting better, is a good sign.

[00:14:30.510] - Speaker 1
I love that you say that. It's true. Thank God that you understand it, that you're like, Exactly.

[00:14:36.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I would say the last one is my favorite, and it's the one that, theoretically, I would say on paper, I am not supposed to like because it's the poppiest of them.

[00:14:52.390] - Speaker 1
100%.

[00:14:53.510] - Speaker 2
But at the same time it's- I don't really listen to poppy music, but it's so good and it's so interesting and it keeps changing. It forces you to pay attention because it's never the same as what you might think someone else's record that sounds anything like this might sound like. It never does the regular. It's always innovating and always changing.

[00:15:18.500] - Speaker 1
The intention is that.

[00:15:20.010] - Speaker 2
I can feel it. I feel it.

[00:15:21.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the intention is that. But thank you so much.

[00:15:25.170] - Speaker 2
I tell you, another pop album happens to also be from Spain is the Tengana The Red Covered album. Right. C, C.

[00:15:32.010] - Speaker 1
That album. Madrileño? Yeah.

[00:15:35.860] - Speaker 2
That album blew my mind. Blue my mind. Fantastic album.

[00:15:41.610] - Speaker 1
I think that when I hear you I'm thinking about some people liking more one album, and then you do another project, and then they liked the previous one before more. I think that as fans, it's usual that you get disappointed because you get attached to something, right? I think that artists, if we're staying true to who we are in every moment, I think we have to get used to disappoint at some point, our fans, I think, because they're probably going to expect something continuista. When they don't get that, or maybe they think, I know the person, I know the artist, I know this, I know this sound, I know that it's familiar. So you hold to that, right? But then, yeah, it's inevitable, I think. It's inevitable. That decepcion. But I think as a fan, it makes you grow. The artist that disappoint you are the ones that make you grow as a fan. It makes you grow in the way you listen to music. Because there's so many artists or albums that when I listen first, I didn't enjoy it. Years after, I go back and I'm like, Exactly. It takes time to process certain things.

[00:17:00.070] - Speaker 2
For sure, especially if the context of what we expect when it changes, we're expecting to hear more of the same, and it's new. At first, it can be jarring.

[00:17:11.940] - Speaker 1
Exactly. The context changes everything, definitely.

[00:17:16.100] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. But I would say because you've done three now that are all different, in a way, your audience is going to be ready for wherever you go. It doesn't mean they like wherever you go, but at least it won't be a surprise of like, Oh, no, she changed. Exactly. Because you're always changing.

[00:17:33.040] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Because that's the constant that they're going to find, that it's always changing. At the end of the day, that's who I am. I rather take the risk of disappointing or not connecting I'm a huge fan of yours. At some point, you said something like, as an artist, just because you do the album or you do the project, just by doing that is enough. You're accomplished, right?

[00:18:00.370] - Speaker 2
Yes. It's successful the minute you finish it. It's a success.

[00:18:06.860] - Speaker 1
Exactly. I agree.

[00:18:08.630] - Speaker 2
I should say the minute you say, Okay, the world can hear it. Exactly. You can't control their reaction.

[00:18:15.220] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:18:16.140] - Speaker 2
But you get to make the thing that you believe and true to you.

[00:18:20.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think that that's enough. I feel like that's more than enough. That's a blessing. If you're capable to close something, finish something and feel like that's exactly what I had to go through. I think that I try to make music from this place. Of course, there's a desire, of connecting. Of course, there's that. But even that exists is not what. It's not the driving force. Yes, it's not the driving force. It cannot be.

[00:18:56.340] - Speaker 2
If it was- When you make something great that you love, it's great. Then if someone else likes it, great. If they don't like it, you wouldn't change it because to make it so they like it, that defeats the purpose.

[00:19:07.960] - Speaker 1
Exactly. It's a gift. If they enjoy it, that's a gift. Yeah.

[00:19:12.400] - Speaker 2
So far, you've had good results in that you've changed and people have accepted the changes. Maybe not everybody. But that's another part of it is that in the change, the new people come, and that's okay.

[00:19:27.750] - Speaker 1
See? I think so. Also, probably when you are older, your audience is maybe not the same as when you're younger. I guess that's just normal. That's just life. Or when you change and somebody just.

[00:19:44.880] - Speaker 2
Separate?

[00:19:45.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that is life, too. Your friends sometimes are not the same. My friends from childhood are not the same as now, and that's just life.

[00:19:53.340] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's growing. It's growing. Yeah. With some friends, you grow together, with some friends, you grow apart.

[00:19:59.830] - Speaker 1
Yeah. There's beauty in accepting that, I think.

[00:20:03.280] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. You're trying to change. You mentioned David Bowie earlier, and I would say David Bowie continually changed. It feels like you're following this trajectory. It feels good.

[00:20:14.320] - Speaker 1
He's an He's a small for me. He's an inspiration. I love how. He was changing so much, and he would even make music about that. I think that I connect so much. I love him.

[00:20:30.560] - Speaker 2
Do you have any ideas of what the next phase is going to... A direction?

[00:20:35.370] - Speaker 1
Yes. I have a whole note in my iPhone so long. I have to scroll, scroll, scroll so much to get to the bottom. Yes. Wow. Yes. I always try to write down everything that I feel in the intuition that I want to go there.

[00:20:53.810] - Speaker 2
Those notes would be more stylistic notes more than lyrics or sometimes a Lyric or or an image? How would you describe the notes?

[00:21:02.450] - Speaker 1
The whole thing. Everything. Yes, I have written about lyrics. I've written about how I imagine the show to be. I write about ideas of type of arrangements I would like to try I write down everything that comes to my head that it has to do with the project.

[00:21:23.430] - Speaker 2
We talked about the first album to the second album. Now, from the second album to the third album, what was different in the way you approached I think I definitely didn't want to repeat what I found in El mal querer.

[00:21:35.820] - Speaker 1
I think also that I found the sound while I was working in it. Yeah. Yeah. While El mal querer, I was clear. How it had to sound before I did it. And so Motomami, I think it was more about more playful, more enjoying the process and making it part of the project, the fact that I was enjoying it. The fun, the sense of humor. You can hear it. Si. Like all the things that maybe in other projects, El Marquerari was much more solemne. Solemne? Yeah..

[00:22:14.410] - Speaker 2
Serious, solemne.

[00:22:15.340] - Speaker 1
Very serious, yeah. But the subject was serious. So it makes sense that it sounded like this or the lyrics were like that, et cetera. I was like, Let me write lyrics different. Let me do it different. Let me do this, even arrange different. Let me Let me try to produce different. Let me try to think it different. Really trying to intentionally separate from the previous one. I think it took me three years because I wasn't sure I wanted to do that jump. As you said before, you said, Oh, you wanted always to be a to be a traditional singer. I think that I was attached somehow to where I come from, where I've learned, how I build myself as a musician. But then I think there was a point where I had to do this jump, I think. I think it was like, either I do it now or I do it in 10 years. I think that now I have the energy, so let me do it. I just did.

[00:23:21.870] - Speaker 2
Where do you think the confidence to continually change comes from? Because I think many artists would be afraid, especially in success.

[00:23:31.710] - Speaker 1
That's a difficult question. Maybe my sister, as she's here, maybe she would say better, or my mom, because they know me really well. They would always say that when I was growing up, they would always say, You're very brave. You're very brave. I think that that probably is part of my personality. I like when things are a little bit risky. I like to be in that place where I know I'm about to fall. Maybe if I don't fall, then I go somewhere else. I really like that feeling.

[00:24:07.410] - Speaker 2
That's exciting.

[00:24:08.210] - Speaker 1
That's an exciting feeling. Yeah.

[00:24:10.100] - Speaker 2
My favorite, too.

[00:24:11.570] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. It's very I think.

[00:24:15.970] - Speaker 2
Where would you say songs come from?

[00:24:18.780] - Speaker 1
From God, from above. Yeah. They're written already.

[00:24:25.550] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your spiritual connection.

[00:24:29.880] - Speaker 1
I think that this man said it really good. Let me see if I pronounce it right. Man Ray. He said... I don't know if I want to say it right, but something like that. He said something like, Creation is divine and reproduction is human. Every original is created from divinity, divinidad. But every reproduction from the original is like a human thing to do. So When I make music, I think a lot about God, and I think that I put myself in service of God. I like to think that I'm in service in the studio, I'm in service, I put myself in service of whatever the energy has to be on stage. I always say that to myself every time before I go to the stage. I'm always like, I'm going to be a channel. I'm a channel. I'm going to be the the most open as I can so this energy flows through me. So I put myself in service. And I think that God's the best artist. He's the best,, where I learn the most. And as humans, we probably have done this forever, right? We've been... The sea is the best drum.

[00:26:01.830] - Speaker 1
You know what I mean?.

[00:26:03.060] - Speaker 2
The rhythm of the ocean, the rhythm of the waves.

[00:26:06.100] - Speaker 1
. Or the heartbeat. Or the heartbeat. Or our voice, which is a gift And that's the beginning of everything. These people from Nueva Guinea, if I'm not wrong, they say that the best music is the one that comes from the trees, the birds. They listen to the birds, and that's music for them. I think that we are always constantly... God is so present, and we can always make music if we just even just look around or listen a little bit. You don't need too much. You know what I mean? You just sit and listen and there's going to be music. Just pay attention. Yeah.

[00:26:50.590] - Speaker 2
Pay attention. It's all- Music is already there. It's all around us all the time.

[00:26:53.900] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Yeah, that's how I feel it. Also, that's why I think I try to be open to all the styles because I think that as humans, we try to find new ways of making things, or we make music in different ways There's these people that they think that the music is from the trees. It's nature. But then there's other people, John Cage, that he would make just una partitura del silencio, but because it's in a context of a concert, it's considered like that. It's considered music. How amazing is to stay open to however music is going to shape, however music is going to happen, because there's infinity of ways it could happen. Absolutely. The same way that there's infinity ways of being a human being. It seems to me crazy when people be like, Oh, this style or this other.

[00:27:55.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it has to be like this. You're right. Yeah, it makes no sense.

[00:27:58.460] - Speaker 1
It makes no sense. Then when I listen to your music, I always felt like you don't have prejudices in the way you create. I really feel connected to that. I love when people create from a place of not No judging if there's something better or worse, which I guess that you are like that.

[00:28:21.400] - Speaker 2
It's just everything is different. I don't think you can even compare different art against other art because-Thank you. They're just different.

[00:28:31.550] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Then awards wouldn't make a lot of sense. No sense.

[00:28:36.300] - Speaker 2
You can't do. How can you say somebody's music is better than somebody else's music? Artist A's music is like Artist A. Artist B's music is like Artist B. Claro. Artist A's music isn't better music B's artist. Do you know like you can't... Yeah, judge it. Yeah, we each make our own best work. It's like saying... In every moment. My diary entry is better than yours. It makes no sense.

[00:29:06.160] - Speaker 1
Exactly. It's my experience. Exactly. I agree.

[00:29:11.560] - Speaker 2
Competition is a strange thing. I don't feel very much I believe it in anything. I just want to make the best thing I can make. I may feel competitive with myself because I like to keep pushing forward. If you make something really good and then you make something not as good, it doesn't feel good to you. But as far as anyone else goes, they have nothing to do with it.

[00:29:31.210] - Speaker 1
Maybe it doesn't feel true to where you are or who you are in that moment. Maybe that's what doesn't feel right. Maybe that's why it doesn't feel right. I don't know.

[00:29:41.740] - Speaker 2
But I know that's the other thing The relationship between time and the music is when you make it, it's a representation of where you are in that moment. If you're willing to work on it until it can't be any better, there it is. It's done. It It can't be anything else.

[00:30:01.340] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly.

[00:30:02.370] - Speaker 2
You could work on it for two more years and it'll turn into something different, but then it'll be- Something different. Yeah, it'll just be a different time.

[00:30:11.100] - Speaker 1
This is a tentador. It's tempting. Tempting. You could always be like spinning around an idea or something to try to find it a different way. It's a tentación.

[00:30:26.030] - Speaker 2
It's okay to do. Sometimes, no. Sometimes you have to go past it to know, oh.

[00:30:32.700] - Speaker 1
Claro, exactly.

[00:30:33.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that last one was really good. Exactly. Sometimes in the moment it happens, you don't know.

[00:30:38.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly.

[00:30:39.760] - Speaker 2
Sometimes it's very obvious right in the moment. There's no rule to any of it. It's either getting better or it's not. That's the experience.

[00:30:49.680] - Speaker 1
But if it's not, then it's maybe getting better for the process, right? Because then you go back. You know that you have to go back. That's what allows you to know, okay, I have to go I think that is very. Yeah.

[00:31:05.590] - Speaker 2
Anytime it starts not feeling all that it can be, I always go back to the last time that I really love, the last version that we really liked, and maybe either that's it or that's the new starting point again. It's like to see where else it could go. Even if we put a lot of time and effort since then, that doesn't matter. All that matters is that it It works. I know some people think, Okay, I'm going to do this, this, and this to it, and then that's going to make it better. That's the thought. Then they do this, this, and this to it, and it's not better. But in their mind, they're like, Well, I did the things I wanted to do, so check those off the list. I'm done. It's not as good as it even was before.

[00:31:52.170] - Speaker 1
Because a creative process is not about checks. You can do a list of things you want to do or something, but it's not that.

[00:32:01.290] - Speaker 2
But sometimes you do the list and then you listen, it's like it's not better. Sometimes it's way better, sometimes it's not better at all.

[00:32:06.510] - Speaker 1
Exactly. I think you have to find... I mean, everybody has their own process there, but to me, I always say to myself to follow the intuition. So sometimes my intuition will say, go this way or go this other, and then that's where I go and that's it. But I think that sometimes people question, they ask me, When do you know that the song is finished? I never know how to really answer I don't know if you have any better answer because I would love to know what you think. But to me, it's very difficult to answer that. I'm always like, I just know that it feels right. I feel anxious every time I listen to it, I know it's not finished. When I can hear it in peace, even I feel it in my body that is relaxed. Even my ears, the way they open, it's a physical feeling even. I know that it's right and it's finished.

[00:32:58.690] - Speaker 2
Then boom, you're That's a good point. So much of it is not intellectual.

[00:33:03.660] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:33:04.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's a feeling. It's emotional, and it happens in our body.

[00:33:08.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I feel it in my body. You feel it.

[00:33:11.670] - Speaker 2
You can relax into it. You can find peace in it, or you could find excitement in it.

[00:33:17.830] - Speaker 1
The energy that you need. Yeah. Yeah. Excitement, too. Exactly.

[00:33:23.330] - Speaker 2
Usually, I find if I'm really excited to play it for a friend, it's a good sign.

[00:33:28.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Do you feel like the way you hear it, it changes depending on who you're playing it for or depending if you're playing it- Absolutely. Right? Absolutely. Why is that, though? I don't understand.

[00:33:40.170] - Speaker 2
Just is. We hear it different in the presence of other people.

[00:33:43.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I agree. That's why I send my music to my mom by email.

[00:33:49.060] - Speaker 2
Instead of looking at her face?

[00:33:52.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I guess, because maybe I don't know how I would feel. I don't know. I never did it. I never showed to her showing in person.

[00:34:00.300] - Speaker 2
Try sometime and see what happens.

[00:34:03.030] - Speaker 1
I'll do it. I'll try.

[00:34:05.620] - Speaker 2
What I like about playing music for other people is not necessarily so much for what their reaction is, but what's going on in me while they're listening, I hear it in a new way. I have a different relationship to it when someone else is listening.

[00:34:22.390] - Speaker 1
Another point of view. It happens to me, too, when I play for other friends. It does happen when I play for friends that are artists, that are musician, I have a different way of listening it. Or when I play for my sister, she's my best friend, and I play for her, and I have a different way of listening it, too. It's crazy context.

[00:34:46.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the whole thing is magic. The creative world is so... None of it necessarily makes sense, but it's really fun. That's how it is. It's so much It's just fun.

[00:35:00.510] - Speaker 1
It's just like that.

[00:35:01.640] - Speaker 2
Do you think writing has to be personal?

[00:35:06.210] - Speaker 1
No.

[00:35:07.270] - Speaker 2
Could be anything.

[00:35:08.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think anything can be a good excuse to make a song. I think that if you have an experience that it's a good excuse to start a song, then that's what you use. If you don't have an experience, then maybe you use fantasy, and that's what you use. I don't think that there's better or worse material in order to write something. I think that the point is to do that, to do that, just write. I think that's the point.

[00:35:43.050] - Speaker 2
Work through it.

[00:35:43.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It doesn't really matter if the story is yours, if it's somebody else's story, if it's nobody's story, if it's everybody's story.

[00:35:54.020] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

[00:35:54.800] - Speaker 1
It doesn't matter.

[00:35:55.510] - Speaker 2
No. Also, it doesn't matter if anybody helps, it's fine. My feeling is some people are very... Some artists are very concerned with, I did this myself. All that matters is that it's good.

[00:36:07.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly.

[00:36:08.360] - Speaker 2
If it's good, everybody wins. It's all good. Everybody's on the same team.

[00:36:12.700] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Who cares who did what? I think just producers care about what other producers have done, about what other writers have write. It doesn't really matter. But again, that requires being humble. That requires being humble, I think, because if you're on service of the song, the music, or whatever you're doing the project however you want to see it, I think that then it's not as important how it happens to be done. Of course, with good intentions, of course, of course. But it doesn't really matter. It's more about getting there. Yeah. I'm telling you, I'm a huge fan, and you say, too, no? It's It's about the best idea getting picked, no?

[00:37:02.560] - Speaker 2
A hundred %. It's all that matters.

[00:37:05.520] - Speaker 1
You've been a master for a long time. We always read your quotes, send it to my sister. My sister send me your quote because she read it, and we love it. It's like, yeah, I love how you think. I think it's always been very present for me when I go to the studio. I remember a lot of times, knowledge that I learn through reading or listening to you.

[00:37:34.900] - Speaker 2
Where does inspiration come to you besides music? Where do you find inspiration for your work?

[00:37:41.060] - Speaker 1
In everything. In my grandma cooking, my from explaining something in Pedro Almodóvar's movie, in, I don't know, reading Maya Angelou poem the other day or seeing Monet painting I feel like everything can be... Anything can be a trigger. It's true. See, I feel like nature is very inspiring, too. I think all kinds of shit, everything, it can be an excuse to start. My sister, definitely talking to her, being with my friends, having conversations in the studio with people that I admire, that I love, and even just talking about the process that we are, where we are, why are we doing this? How are we doing it? This, that, showing different references to each other. I think that the conversation helps definitely with the creative process, too. I think that making music a lot of times is a conversation with other artists from the past, what has been before you, what has been there, other artists around you. Just a conversation, I think. Yeah.

[00:39:03.590] - Speaker 2
All we are is the subtotal of everything we've experienced in our lives. So nothing really starts with us. We're always part of a lineage. We're just a vehicle It's very difficult to move it forward.

[00:39:16.260] - Speaker 1
Yeah. God is the first one. It's the first thing. Then. I don't know what do you think about this. Todo. There's always something before, right? Yes. There's always something before. What do you think about the concept of appropriación, for example, which is something that is so common nowadays is that people talk a lot about it.

[00:39:44.900] - Speaker 2
I think it's an impossible idea. It's crazy. I mean, the only reason you make something like something that someone else has ever made is in tribute to that. It's never You're never undermining that thing. You're shining light on it by doing something like it because you think it's so beautiful.

[00:40:06.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Or something that is inspired in. Yeah, always.

[00:40:11.270] - Speaker 2
I think we can be inspired by anything, and it's only good.

[00:40:15.410] - Speaker 1
A lot of art is being created from other art, right? At the end of the day, that's the origin of things because everything is created by something that it was created before or with the knowledge that was that thing before or that person or that energy or that thing. I understand that people have a feeling of belong, pertenecer. But I think if they feel that they don't understand it.

[00:40:47.000] - Speaker 2
I think it's a misunderstanding.

[00:40:50.770] - Speaker 1
I've been thinking for a long time about this. I was always curious, what would you think? Because to me, I understand that feeling belong, or the pertenecer. But I think it's different the feeling of possess something. I never felt like I possess anything, even anything I've done because I don't even feel like It's not necessarily done it. You know what I mean? Yes.

[00:41:19.010] - Speaker 2
You're part of it, but it has its own life.

[00:41:24.110] - Speaker 1
It has its own life, exactly.

[00:41:25.290] - Speaker 2
The way you relate to it and the way other people relate to it, even that's not the same. You can write something and know exactly what you're thinking, and then someone else gets to experience it, and they have their own experience. It has nothing to do with what's in your head. It becomes new when someone else experiences it.

[00:41:43.910] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:41:45.110] - Speaker 2
It's not the same thing you made anymore.

[00:41:47.960] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Even that.

[00:41:49.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's always changing. It's always changing.

[00:41:53.230] - Speaker 1
It's always changing, exactly.

[00:41:56.010] - Speaker 2
Again, all we ever make comes from somewhere. It doesn't start with us. It's always starting somewhere. We're always inspired by something. Through our filter, we find the most interesting combination of this experience from today and this experience from 20 years ago and this thing that I saw in a movie one time and the thing I overheard at the coffee shop, all of those things combined together to make this new thing.

[00:42:24.910] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That's why maybe we should never be afraid of the creative process, I think, because if If you understand how powerful it is that everybody's different and everybody has their own combination of all these elements, then you'd always be able to do something unique. Absolutely. When something is unique, no, I fire I don't know how to say that in English. There's no mistake. There's no room for... There's no room for... Fucking up? A mistake. A mistake, yeah. There's no room for that. I think that we should always be open to however it has to be, depending on who we are.

[00:43:03.030] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. I will even say, if you tried to directly copy what someone else does, it's going to be different when you do it than when they do it.

[00:43:14.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But that's a human exercise.

[00:43:16.630] - Speaker 2
If you look at the history of music, the Beatles wanted to do music like Motown, like American music. It doesn't sound like it. Exactly.

[00:43:24.130] - Speaker 1
Or Rolling Stones.

[00:43:24.490] - Speaker 2
It sounds like the Beatles. Right. Led Zeppelin wanted to do American Blues music. It doesn't It sounds like American music. It sounds like Led Zeppelin.

[00:43:32.770] - Speaker 1
And thank God, no?

[00:43:33.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, because it sounds like who they are. Claro. And who they are. It's like if you write a script for a movie and give it to five different directors, you're going to get five different movies, even with the same script.

[00:43:47.070] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:43:47.880] - Speaker 2
We each have our own way that we do the things that we do, and it's always different. What's it like playing a song comes to life in the recording studio, you record it and then it lives on in that people listen to it, but then you play it on stage. Does your relationship to the songs change through playing them on stage?

[00:44:12.220] - Speaker 1
No.

[00:44:13.580] - Speaker 2
Same?

[00:44:14.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah. If I love a song, I love a song. My love for that music doesn't necessarily grow or no. Maybe I'm not in touch enough with how it's changing, but I don't feel it.

[00:44:30.410] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:44:31.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think that however I see it once it's finished is how it feels. Yeah, that's how I see it. I don't know if with time, I don't feel any different from when I did- If you do a song from the first album now? I feel the same way. I was actually doing the plata in this tour, in the Motomami tour. I feel like maybe I was trying to sing it a little bit more open if I I was trying to sing it this and that, but not the way I see the song. I just distorted a little bit more the guitar to make it feel a little bit closer to how was the energy in Motomami, and that's it. I didn't necessarily change how I feel about the song, though.

[00:45:17.340] - Speaker 2
Do you have to think about it when you're singing or it's just say it just is like automatic?

[00:45:22.510] - Speaker 1
When you say think about it, what you mean?

[00:45:24.910] - Speaker 2
When you're in the song, are you thinking about what lines come next? Are you thinking about or are you experiencing the song as it's happening?

[00:45:36.310] - Speaker 1
Depending on the night. The night that I'm more in my body, the night that I'm a little bit more in my head. When I'm in my head, I try to go a little bit back as much as I can. Most of the time, I think that I focus, especially in the plata, for example, I focus on the feeling of openness or the feeling of just finding a good feeling in moving. The movement, I think it's so key. I think the more I grow as a musician or as a performer, or however you want to call it, the more I find out that movement is the key. I think that before when I was studying, I think the teachers will focus a lot in being on key, singing with the right-The right note. The right note, the right this, the right that. I haven't discovered too long, maybe, how important I think is movement. When the movement is right, There's no right or wrong, though. When the movement is in its center, I don't know how to explain, the energy. When the energy is there, the movement is there, and then the sound of it, it's there.

[00:46:58.230] - Speaker 1
So the more the loose closer I can get on the movement, the better it always sounds.

[00:47:04.770] - Speaker 2
You feel like if you're physically connected to the music in the way your body's moving, then vocally, it's going to be better?

[00:47:11.500] - Speaker 1
Yes, which is not going to be perfect. That doesn't mean it's going to be perfect. It doesn't mean that that night maybe it's going to be the pitch is going to be the best, but most of the time it is, and it really makes a difference. I try to focus mainly on that once I've really processed the It's like, once I really know each line, the intention of each line, at least the intention I understand in each line, then I think I just start to get lost in the body. That's what I've been,. That's where I've been in this last tour.

[00:47:52.410] - Speaker 2
Tell me what the tour is like. What's the show like? I've never seen you live.

[00:47:56.970] - Speaker 1
The show is a A show that I think you can enjoy from different points of views. If you see the show from the screen, it's a different show. If you see the show looking to the stage, close to the stage, you're going to find another show. If you see the show from back, back, back, back, but looking to the stage is going to be another show. I think that this is a show created having in mind that there's going to be a big number of people and trying to have in mind to be generous with the experience that we're going to share with them. I think there's not a lot of props. There's not a lot of... Especially in the moto mommy tour, there was not a lot of things on stage. There was not fireworks, there was no fire, that, that, that. But it was more focused, I think, on the emotion and on the- Is there a live band? No.

[00:48:55.380] - Speaker 2
No band? No band. You're on stage by yourself? Yes.

[00:48:59.240] - Speaker 1
Wow. We're eight dancers.

[00:49:00.920] - Speaker 2
That's amazing. There's eight dancers. That's better. I'm excited. I want to see that.

[00:49:04.640] - Speaker 1
Thank you. There's eight male dancers. There's a huge screen on the back of the stage, and But before it wasn't like that. There was just a white canvas. There's no band. By the way, a lot of people were pissed off that there was no band. I was like, damn, I'm singing my ass off for almost two hours. I'm playing the guitar, I'm playing the piano, and I'm dancing so much, and still you complain about not being a band.

[00:49:40.550] - Speaker 2
It actually sounds better without a band.

[00:49:43.100] - Speaker 1
It just depends on the No, just sonically, it can really sound good if you don't have a band because it's already...

[00:49:49.530] - Speaker 2
It can sound really good. It's optimized to sound good. It's hard to make a band sound good going from venue to venue night to night.

[00:49:57.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah, which there's beauty in that... How in that challenge, too. But I think it just depends on the project. Absolutely. I think Motomami, there's not a band in the studio to make this album. Why is it going to be a band on stage to play this album? I don't know, to me, it's so obvious, but it seems that for other people, they miss that. But I think it's the attachment they could have to how they have experienced concerts. But to me, I think a concert can be so many things. Absolutely. Yeah, a concert can be so many things. It doesn't really matter how you present it. It's more about, did you get the feeling? Did you get any energy when you went? Did you go home feeling different? Because at the end of the day, my main goal when I create a performance is that.

[00:50:48.220] - Speaker 2
Energy. The energy. I'm with you. I'm so excited you didn't have a band because I was sure you were going to say, Of course, I have a band. Oh, really? Yeah, but I'm so happy you don't. You really thought that, though. Yes, because it's the I expected it's great. It's great. I love it.

[00:51:03.370] - Speaker 1
I think that I'm going to have a band at some point.

[00:51:07.600] - Speaker 2
I'm sure at some point. When it makes sense. When it makes sense. In the early days of hip hop music, the music that came before the music that we made was made by bands because the people who were making the records, that's how they knew how to do it. But if I went to a hip hop club, there was no band player. It was a DJ, maybe drum machines, but mostly scratching and DJing. Exactly. I started making records that were scratching and DJing and drum machines and those kinds of records. Live, it would be a DJ scratching, sometimes a drum machine. Then over time, as When the cop became bigger, some of the artists started bringing bands on the road. It's like, that's just something else. It's like going back to some old thing. There was this whole revolution to buy to bypass that.

[00:52:00.940] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:52:02.030] - Speaker 2
In the days when rap groups were opening for rock groups or band groups, even though the rap groups were the opening acts, they always sounded better than the rock group every time. Just because the nature of- It's inevitable, yeah. Yeah.

[00:52:16.750] - Speaker 1
Just technologically, it could sound really good.

[00:52:20.650] - Speaker 2
Yes. It did.

[00:52:23.010] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and that's exciting.

[00:52:24.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:52:25.980] - Speaker 1
Also, I think that a band has a presence that, I don't know if you want that, depending on the project, right?

[00:52:32.880] - Speaker 2
It depends on what it is. But also, to me, it can also create a sense of makes it dated.

[00:52:42.600] - Speaker 1
Right. I think depending on how you use it, though. Absolutely.

[00:52:46.410] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think- There's no right or wrong way to do anything.

[00:52:49.080] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it depends on how you do it. But I think that, for example, having a man on stage, it's definitely going to be a presence and it's definitely going to be an intention. It's going to be something that you play with that, you present that. I think that in my case, I just wanted to present something different. I wanted to be more centered in movement. Also, it made more sense with the type of beats. Those are reguetón beats a lot. Or reguetón drums. Those drums, I don't necessarily feel motivated to listen in an instrument that is acoustic on stage and try to get a good sound of that when it's already sounding good like that. Also the origin of it, again, as you say, with this type of music, as you're saying, there's somebody que está pinchando. There's not like a band playing those type of beats. To me, it's obvious. Yeah, there are going to be moments that a band, it's perfect for an artist and a project. There are times that no. That doesn't make it a better concert or worse concert. By the way, there's so many ways of making a concert.

[00:54:02.810] - Speaker 1
At the end of the day, a concert, what is a concert? It's a social moment. It's just an. There's so many ways of approaching that.

[00:54:12.800] - Speaker 2
I love the idea of going against any expectations of what we think it has been in the past. Exactly. How cool would it be to go to a concert and have it feel like an experience you never had before? Yeah.

[00:54:25.650] - Speaker 1
I actually think that's the goal. That's the best. Yeah, that's the goal.

[00:54:29.570] - Speaker 2
Tell me what type of music you listen to now.

[00:54:34.270] - Speaker 1
I listen a lot of music in the shower. I've been obsessed for a couple of years and trying to listen all Nina's discography, the discography of Nina Simone. I've been listening to- Nina Simone's unbelievable. Yeah.un Unbelievable. There's something that every time I don't feel really good. I play her albums and warms my soul. The way she sounds and the way she plays, there's something about the decision she makes that it just me desarma, guard down. Me desarma. I really love her, and I've been listening to her a lot. Areta, too? Areta Franklin, right? I've been listening to her a lot, too. I think that when I travel Well, it makes me listen to music, depending on where I am, trying to understand better the place that I am or trying to get closer to something that I don't understand yet or something. I think that with them, I've been trying to listen more of Areta because naturally, I will listen more to Nina. Of course, they are so different, but I admire so much the way she sings, Areta Franklin, but I really, really, really feel how Nina Simone makes music.

[00:56:05.940] - Speaker 2
I was very lucky to get to see her play live one time in New York City at the Beacon Theater. I didn't know that much about her then when I got to see her, maybe when I was in college. She had not been in the United States for many years. She came out and she played... The first song she played was Black as the of My True Love's Hair, and it was staggering. Unbelievable. Someone in the audience yelled, Welcome home, Nina. She got up and started screaming, This is not my home. Africa is my home, and went on a wild rant. I never saw anything like it. It was so cool.

[00:56:53.720] - Speaker 1
Wow. I never performed, of course. I saw the.

[00:57:01.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah, documentary.

[00:57:03.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah, documentary. I just got that feeling of her not being understood. A general feeling of this woman was on Earth sharing so much, being so generous and still not feeling seen or understood enough. Fuck, that just me tocó. It was very inspiring to know about her story.

[00:57:26.980] - Speaker 2
Do you ever feel not understood in what you do?

[00:57:32.090] - Speaker 1
I think I feel very grateful that I can make the music that I truly believe in and that I can actually connect with a lot of people by creating projects. I think that I focus more on that than in anything else. But at the same time, there's definitely, I don't know why, but the people that they don't see you or they don't understand. They are there, too, and it's really impossible to ignore. To be like, No, I don't see that. Of course, it's impossible to not acknowledge that that exists. But you can't change for them. Claro. But I don't know. I feel like for some people, there's artists that maybe they like fighting more, they like confrontation more. But I'm a Libra. I like when things are chill. I don't like confrontation too much. When I find that it's not even me, it's more like the projection or the idea that some people get about me, persona pública, or however they want to... However they see, whatever they see, the confrontation that they can have with that or the negativity that can be in this type of thing. I don't know. I don't feel like that is a place or something that triggers me to create.

[00:59:09.310] - Speaker 1
I know there's other artists that they find something in that. I could say that there's lyrics that I've done where I've had some of that. I used some of that energy to be like, Okay, I'm going to change this energy, and I'm going to darle la vuelta. But it's not one of the best, I places to create from. It's not the most fruit.

[00:59:34.790] - Speaker 2
No, it's lower vibration.

[00:59:37.330] - Speaker 1
Exactly. I understand that other people, I don't know, there's other artists that are more that they like, Terra. I understand, but I don't think that it's my story or it's me. I try to focus more on the positive and on the love, if that makes sense.

[00:59:57.510] - Speaker 2
Yes. I think also when people see you differently than you are, it often has more to do with them than it does with you.

[01:00:05.670] - Speaker 1
Exactly. It talks more about them or what they need to see. I think that also as an artist, sometimes the thing is relieving to think, Okay, I'm whatever you need me to be in this moment. I'm this mirror where you're going to see what you need to see. I'm going to be this sound that you're going to hear what you need to hear. When people don't understand my lyrics, sometimes they say, Oh, her diction is not really good, blah, blah, blah, and they don't understand the lyrics. Sometimes I even think, Oh, maybe that's not bad. Maybe that's not bad because then it's ambiguous, that makes people hear what they need to hear. Absolutely. You know what I mean? I think that nothing is. If that's who I am, then that's who I am. I hope that they find what they need to find. I'm not trying to change it so much because I I guess that it's natural to try to be like, I want to be seen. I want to be understood, blah, blah, blah. At the end of the day, I think that I rather focus on I want to know who I am.

[01:01:11.640] - Speaker 1
I want to be focused on my path.

[01:01:14.770] - Speaker 2
You're going inside, not going outside.

[01:01:16.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah, more going inside. More like, I know what I need to go through in this moment, and that's what I'm going to do. I hope that they're going to find what they need to find in that.

[01:01:26.610] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. That's fantastic. What type of movies do you watch?

[01:01:32.830] - Speaker 1
What type of movies do I watch? I watched the other day this movie, very beautiful. I'm so bad for the names. I forget words so easily. Billy,. Yeah, this movie, Closed. It made me cry so much. Dios mío. It was years that I didn't cry so much. I think since I was a teenager and somebody broke my heart. This movie, oh, from this French guy, so close, from Lucas Don. I swear you have to watch it. You don't have to watch it, but I think that you will love it, I think.

[01:02:16.220] - Speaker 2
You cried upset or cried- No, relieving.

[01:02:20.340] - Speaker 1
I cried like, Fuck, there's too much beauty in this. There's too much beauty. But I love, I don't know, I love movies that has, I don't know, Tarantino, Ultra Violencia. It's very interesting, too. I don't know, like something that I'm not used to see in my day-to-day. I think that it's very interesting or it challenges energy that is not where I am most of the day. Or Pedro Almodo, where I love how he sees women, how he sees Planet Hia Femenina, how he understands it, how explains it or the culture from my country. I love to see his point of view. See, but I love series, too. I've been watching Succession.

[01:03:10.470] - Speaker 2
I'm not seen.

[01:03:11.290] - Speaker 1
I've been watching this show. Very interesting. It puts me a little bit in tension, I'm not going to lie. I feel a little bit tense when I watch it. I don't watch it necessarily the whole episode. Sometimes it takes me moments.

[01:03:26.540] - Speaker 2
I don't like to feel tense. I don't pick things that make me feel scared or tense. I try not to watch. Yeah.

[01:03:35.070] - Speaker 1
So horror movies you hate?

[01:03:37.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't watch horror movies. Yeah, I don't watch it. No, but I'll watch Tarantino movies, even though there's violence, and I don't normally like to see violence. It's different, though. But something with him, it's always like with a wink or camp. Yes. It feels as much like commentary about the violence as the actual... It doesn't seem like it's brutal.

[01:03:58.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly.

[01:03:59.470] - Speaker 2
Or Or it's too much where it's like a cartoon. It doesn't feel personal.

[01:04:05.080] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's true. It doesn't feel personal. It feels like you're seeing his point of view all the time, how he thinks. I mean, at least, I don't know your interpretation of how he thinks. I think that there's always like, I don't know, it's not violence that I cannot handle. It's just like something that in the way he does it, very tasteful that I can handle it. When sometimes when it's too much, I'm like, No.

[01:04:32.160] - Speaker 2
Have you seen his new book? He's got a great book.

[01:04:34.480] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:04:35.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Cinema Speculation came out at the end of last year, and it's great. See? Yeah.

[01:04:41.360] - Speaker 1
Wow. Okay. About him explaining how he thinks.

[01:04:44.890] - Speaker 2
He's talking about the movies that he grew up watching, his relationship to movies. Very beautiful book.

[01:04:51.040] - Speaker 1
Wow. Yeah. Thank you for letting me know. The movies that you like the most?

[01:04:58.570] - Speaker 2
Probably old movies. I don't watch so many current movies, but I watch old movies. The new movies I watch are, do you know Mubi, M-U-B-I? It's like a streaming service like Netflix, but it's only cool.

[01:05:13.430] - Speaker 1
See, I've heard. But no With art movies. See, see. Like filming?

[01:05:16.960] - Speaker 2
Very good. I think it maybe it's French.

[01:05:19.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:05:20.690] - Speaker 2
Very good.

[01:05:21.790] - Speaker 1
Oh, wow. I'll check.

[01:05:24.460] - Speaker 2
But many of them are tense. If it gets too tense, I stop watching. But I like seeing how beautiful they look. They really look beautiful.

[01:05:32.910] - Speaker 1
There were some things that I wanted to ask you. Let me remember. I wanted to ask you, what do you think about the concept of sacrifice, to be an artist and to stay connected with your purpose and really putting all the energy that you have and everything.

[01:05:57.480] - Speaker 2
Total commitment to your craft.

[01:05:59.430] - Speaker 1
Sí, exactly. Perfect words. In order to do that, you think that what do you think is the sacrifice, in that?

[01:06:09.820] - Speaker 2
I think it's a tremendous sacrifice in that if you put your craft as the most important thing in your life, and it's the total focus, it's very difficult to discuss how different that is than the way other people get to live. It's like being a monk. It's It's a serious commitment because it's not just when you're in the studio, it's not just when you're performing. It's all the time because you're the conduit for this creative energy, and there's no off time because it's not up to us. As the creators, it's not up to us. Every time there's an inspiration or an emotion that comes up, we're mining those. That's part of our work. We're paying attention, and we're always in this awareness practice that's just very different. It's a serious commitment. I'm used to it because I've been doing it my whole life. But I would say it's not for everybody. Yeah, I agree. I think most people think of it as all a big party, and it's not.

[01:07:27.790] - Speaker 1
That's so true. Actually, so many people think that being an artist is like, hee-hee, ha-ha. It can be, though.

[01:07:36.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah, there's definitely moments of that, but it's not based on that. It's based on this commitment to whatever it takes to be great.

[01:07:48.180] - Speaker 1
You think that commitment... Okay, so excellence requires commitment. Commitment requires sacrifice. That's how you would think it?

[01:07:56.870] - Speaker 2
Yes, but I don't think about the sacrifice so Very much. But yes, it certainly exists. It certainly exists. But there's sacrifice in everything we do, not even just commitment. There's always sacrifice. In every decision we make, there's another path that we didn't take. Yeah.

[01:08:16.520] - Speaker 1
I ask you because I think that for how I was raised, I think that the concept of sacrifice is very present. I think that you can get excellence and still can have joy.

[01:08:35.360] - Speaker 2
You can have joy. Yeah.

[01:08:37.540] - Speaker 1
I think that you can have joy in sacrifice. Exactly. That's what I think. Because sometimes I think that people think about sacrifice in a way that it has to be that it doesn't have to do with joy. I think that you can find joy in that.

[01:08:54.240] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. If your highest intention is being of service, That gives joy. Sacrifice is part of accomplishing that joy of sacrifice, the joy of service.

[01:09:09.230] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly.

[01:09:11.300] - Speaker 2
It's a spiritual concept.

[01:09:13.500] - Speaker 1
Yeah. See, also I wanted to know what's your point of view about this. I think that a lot of times, socially, it's much easier to think about men that are creatores, creators, that are men that are excellent in what they do as genius, the concept of. But then when it's about a female or women, I think that it's more about, oh, brilliant. But not genius, right? It's usual that- That's interesting. Yeah, it's usual that. I think that socially you can tell the way people judge women's work or judge men's work. I'll be like, What's the reason of that? The origin. I wonder, what's the origin? I don't know.

[01:10:08.670] - Speaker 2
I know that any time there's a label, whether it be genius or brilliant, it's not really helpful It's awful. The labels don't make anything better. Even to me, man and woman, I definitely acknowledge men and women as different. But I don't think in terms of if we're making something It doesn't matter if the man made it or the woman made it, if it's something other than maybe a baby, where it makes a big difference. But in general, again, everybody's working together for this this purpose, I'll say I've worked with some women musicians in the past who have felt an extra need to be in control in a way that maybe some men artists don't feel. It doesn't seem like it, from my point of view, seeing it from the outside, it doesn't seem necessary. It feels like it's taking on extra work for no reason, not to make it better, but to prove something, and there's nothing to prove.

[01:11:14.330] - Speaker 1
I think it cannot be nothing to prove, but I think that that comes from the fact that socially, I think it's easier to celebrate men, como creadores o profesionales de cosas. When they are professionalized, I think it's easier to celebrate men doing things great than than women, socialmente. I just wonder because sometimes my sister and I, we talk about this, and it's like, what's the reason? And that makes men maybe feel that difference and makes men move in a certain way just because of that difference, too. I I think that the men that I've met as artist, they're extremely obsessive, and they can become so great at what they do because of this compulsivo, like very obsessive. While women that I've met that they create, a lot of times, I don't feel that, that compulsion, that obsession. I feel it's more about... It's more natural, the creation. For women, there's not this need of control that you would be talking about. For me, I think that some women can be worried about how things get credit, how things are explained, the narrative, because maybe the narrative hasn't been fair enough for a lot of years.

[01:12:47.790] - Speaker 1
I understand, for example, when people would explain me that Björk would fight nobody, I don't know if the word is fight, but she would give a lot of importance to the credits in order for people to understand la creadora that she is. But actually in the process of creating, male energy is much more controlling to me. Much more controlling in the actual creation. It's interesting. Maybe it's the men that I've met, though. They are great as what they're like, beast. Amazing. But I feel more I don't know, there's just something very organic and not trying to prove too much and just creating by nature from women. Yeah. See, and I don't know. There's something about that that I was like, I'm curious about what he thinks.

[01:13:44.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It's interesting. I would say that early in my career, I was more controlling right in the beginning, but only because I didn't have as much experience to see as big of a picture. So When I first started making things, I felt like I had a vision for how to do it, so that was the right thing.

[01:14:06.620] - Speaker 1
But that was for the first couple of years.

[01:14:10.280] - Speaker 2
But once I saw, Oh, other people have great ideas, too, then it changed.

[01:14:16.900] - Speaker 1
You were more open.

[01:14:18.060] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. I think many people, goes back to what we were talking about originally with, if people find a way that works for them, they tend to stick with that.

[01:14:31.480] - Speaker 1
They stick to that, yeah.

[01:14:32.090] - Speaker 2
I don't have that. I like the evolution and the change and the excitement. If I was making the same music I was making 35 years ago, I wouldn't be doing it anymore because it'd be boring. Did that. The fact that it's always something new and finding some new way in is very exciting, much more fun.

[01:14:58.440] - Speaker 1
The process has to be It's different. I think that it's much more exciting when the process is always different.

[01:15:06.910] - Speaker 2
Yeah. There's no right way. That's the other part. There is no right way to do this. It's a million ways.

[01:15:14.690] - Speaker 1
You think that they all going to lead you to a different place or different ways are going to lead you to one place?

[01:15:21.760] - Speaker 2
I think the different ways lead you to a different place, and then it's up to you to decide which is the one you like.

[01:15:27.750] - Speaker 1
Claro. Yeah. Like preference.

[01:15:31.230] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I also, I don't know, I think this maybe is more of a fatalistic view that the choices we make lead us to the place that we need to get to. It's a little different than what I just said, but I think that's true. I think, yes, we get to make all these choices, but there's also some part of our lives go the way they're meant to go. I know some incredibly talented talented people who, for whatever reason, never had success. It's not because they're not talented enough. It's not in the stars. They didn't do anything wrong. Then there are other people who, for whatever reason, either. Some people just have a really good work ethic, and great stuff happens for them, or some people just happen to be very lucky, and great things happen for them. There's no rule in any of these. I will say, I know that regardless of who's doing it, if you're not willing to work very hard for a long time, it doesn't work, regardless of any of the other stuff.

[01:16:38.170] - Speaker 1
You know.

[01:16:39.770] - Speaker 2
It's very hard work and takes tremendous amount of focus and attention.

[01:16:44.270] - Speaker 1
It does.

[01:16:45.250] - Speaker 2
It doesn't happen. It's not an accident.

[01:16:48.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's not an accident. I agree. I think that there's a component, the destino, fate, a component of that in life. Because I agree, I've seen that, too. I've seen people that I'm like, why this doesn't turn in the way they want it? But maybe even you desire something a lot, that doesn't mean that that's God's plan for you. I think that if you stay humble, if you have enough, you'll understand what God's plan is for you, right? Then you're going to maybe find joy in that once you are there, once you are in that path. I think I always felt that I had to make music. I always knew since I was very young, and I always stayed focused on that, focused on this is where I'm going. This is how it My life is. My sister will say sometimes, Would you do something different? Do you see yourself having a different life? I don't think that I do. I don't think that I see another option. I don't see myself doing something different. I know why I'm here. When you know, you cannot look to another. No. My experience was different because I didn't know.

[01:18:13.920] - Speaker 2
I knew I would make music, and it would be the most important thing in my life, but I never knew it could be a job. I thought I would have a job. Really? And music would be my hobby, of course.

[01:18:24.090] - Speaker 1
You started then the label?

[01:18:27.470] - Speaker 2
Just for fun.

[01:18:28.340] - Speaker 1
For fun?

[01:18:28.840] - Speaker 2
Oh, absolutely. I love that. Yeah, we hoped to sell enough records to make another record. That's all it ever was. At that time, anyone who was making hip hop music at that time had any expectations of success because no one had ever had it.

[01:18:47.060] - Speaker 1
But that's why maybe it was amazing.

[01:18:49.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it was pure. It was just pure people making art for the sake of making art because they loved it. I thought I'd have a real job, and then I would make music in the time that I didn't have to work to support myself.

[01:19:02.810] - Speaker 1
Yeah, claro.

[01:19:04.920] - Speaker 2
That's an example where I didn't even know. I knew what I liked to do, but I didn't think that it was a possible path. That happened all by itself.

[01:19:15.190] - Speaker 1
You didn't thought that that was a possibility. It happened, it rebuilt, and then you follow it.

[01:19:21.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Now I feel a sense of obligation because it has been so beautiful When an artist comes to me and ask for help, I feel an obligation to help because I feel like that's why I'm here. Again, I didn't decide that. That's how it has been.

[01:19:41.900] - Speaker 1
It happened. It happened.

[01:19:42.930] - Speaker 2
I wanted to live up to my potential, whatever that is.

[01:19:47.860] - Speaker 1
I think if you have the blessing of seeing with clarity, I think that's a responsibility. It makes sense that you use it and you live honoring that responsibility. Honoring that responsibility. Absolutely. It takes me forever to translate It's okay.

[01:20:14.980] - Speaker 2
It sounds nice. I like to hear it.

[01:20:18.080] - Speaker 1
It takes forever in my head to translate because I think in Spanish. I try to find the right words to say the thoughts in English. I can feel just by being in front of you that you are where you're supposed to be. Because of the music you've done, that's so obvious, too. Even when we talk, the way your eyes spark, how old are you?

[01:20:46.310] - Speaker 2
How old am I? Yes. Sixty.

[01:20:48.300] - Speaker 1
That's amazing. Honestly, that's goals. To me, right now, being with you today, that's goals. But also being with 60, with clarity, and also a spark, como brillo en los ojos, I think that's all I would want when I'm 60. I imagine myself making music when I'm older.

[01:21:13.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:21:13.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Making music Not my albums necessarily. If got one, yes. But they have nothing to explain, nothing to say, I rather than not do it, not do it and help other people to do them. This place is so beautiful, by the way.

[01:21:29.310] - Speaker 2
Thank you.

[01:21:30.830] - Speaker 1
I love the decision that you made of not making this room too big. Smart. Yes. I feel like the nature is much more important than the actual space where we are.

[01:21:46.430] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. The room. When it's warmer, we have these doors open. Oh, see? It's like being outside when you are.

[01:21:54.460] - Speaker 1
Stop, really? Yeah.

[01:21:55.910] - Speaker 2
Oh, thank you so much for doing this. Of course. Pleasure speaking to you.

[01:21:58.840] - Speaker 1
My pleasure, too.
