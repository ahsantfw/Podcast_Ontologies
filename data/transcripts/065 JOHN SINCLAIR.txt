[00:00:07.780] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammatism. I'm surrounded by music at all times. Right now, I'm talking to you, so I turned off my radio, but I got my own radio station.

[00:00:32.440] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:00:33.270] - Speaker 1
Online. I got 12 disk jackeys. I put up 2 hours of new music every day for 20 years.

[00:00:40.980] - Speaker 2
How do I find it online?

[00:00:44.150] - Speaker 1
Radio3 amsterdam. Org. We started in 2004 in Amsterdam.

[00:00:52.210] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:00:53.070] - Speaker 1
My 38th program was podcast. I've been a radio freak since I was a little kid. I'm now 81.

[00:01:01.540] - Speaker 2
Tell me your first memories of radio. What first got you?

[00:01:05.570] - Speaker 1
Well, I grew up on radio in the '40s, you see. Before television.

[00:01:11.740] - Speaker 2
Was it even in the car then, or was it just a wooden box in the house?

[00:01:15.900] - Speaker 1
Well, you had a little one. My dad got me one for my son's birthday. He made for my kid, a radio. When I was 14, he bought me a '45 plate. You could plug into the back of the radio. I remember the first I got was Hired, Hired Woman by Big Walter Horton on States 154. Amazing. I was a Blues fanatic when I was about 11, 12 years old. I've been gone ever since.

[00:01:46.490] - Speaker 2
Was everyone else you knew in the neighborhood a Blues fanatic?

[00:01:49.440] - Speaker 1
No, nobody.

[00:01:50.520] - Speaker 2
How did that happen to you?

[00:01:52.460] - Speaker 1
When I grew up, you listened to the radio. All the programs, the quiz shows, the drama, the serials, the cowboy show, Superman, all of that was on the radio. So you listened to the radio like kids watch TV. And then around 1950, they started moving everything to TV, and they changed radio to a format for music 24 hours a day. Well, a lot of them closed at sundown. You imagine that at a radio station shutting down at Sundown. Crazy. A lot of them did that. Big ones meant what, 24 hours. Well, there was a handful of black radio stations, black oriented. The first one was in 1948 in Memphis, Tennessee. Cwdia. Before that, it was all white oriented. So I discovered a black oriented radio station in Flint, Michigan, my hometown. So I started listening to that and then I heard this incredible music. Ray Charles, the Clovers, the Drifters, Ruth Brown, et cetera. That's just the Atlantic records. Eddie Bo on Apollo. I got to be friends with Eddie Bo in New Orleans, and I told him I had his first record. He said, I was 13. He said, How did you get that?

[00:03:27.900] - Speaker 1
I was 13. That's where I was at. I discovered this disk, Jacky, named Fantic Ernie Durham. He was on a station in Flint. He rhymed everything he said. That was the most exciting shit I'd ever heard in my life. So I was in him every day for hours. I'd come home from school. Instead of playing outside, I'd be listening to Ernie James because you didn't have a portable radio then, like you said. And then I discovered at night, they had a guy on CKLW in Detroit named Ron Knowles. He played rhythm and blues. And then after he went off, he could get WLAC out of Nashville, Tennessee, and Jumping John R would be playing the blues, rhythm and blues. Rhythm and Rhythm and Blues.

[00:04:15.570] - Speaker 2
How were you able to find the records? I can't imagine they were easy to find back then.

[00:04:21.240] - Speaker 1
Wlac, they were a country station. They had this great concept for rhythm and blues. They were sponsored by record shops, mail order record shops, Randy's Records of Gallatin and only Gallatin, Tennessee. Ernie's record, marked 1793rd Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee. You can send away for them. They have these great things that have the Blue Star Blues special. Six records, 12 big size for 279 plus packing mailing in COD. Send no money, just your name and address, and they'd ship them to your COD. Or you could buy, if you're listening to John R, if you liked one record on there. Say Bobby Bluegland had a new record on Duke and you really liked it. You could just send them a postcard saying, Number 8 as played on today's day. And they would send you the Bobby Bluegland single, COD. And then when I got older enough to hit take around, I was on a record chap to record chap and steal 45s. I stole thousands because I wanted them all, but I didn't have any money.

[00:05:38.320] - Speaker 2
When did you first have friends who liked music like you liked music, to play music together and enjoy it together?

[00:05:45.770] - Speaker 1
Well, by the time I got in high school, of course, Rhythm and the Boys had crossed over. I had the first Chuck Berry record on Ches, I had the first Little Richard records on Special T, Fats Domino on Imperial, Bode-Diddly on Checker. I had them all as soon as it came out. Well, these crossed over and they played on the radio for white people. So other teenagers, this is where Rock 'n' Roll came in. And the other people Well, otherwise, we're square white kids. They adopted this music because it was so powerful. Tooty-fruity by Little Richard. Incredible. They get in the head with a hammer.

[00:06:29.940] - Speaker 2
Was there any other music that spoke to you, or was it all blues and RnB at that time?

[00:06:35.150] - Speaker 1
All blues and RnB. When I went to college, I got turned on to jazz by a guy. Anyway, yeah.

[00:06:43.080] - Speaker 2
No, tell me about that. Tell me about getting turned on to jazz and the experience of falling into it.

[00:06:48.180] - Speaker 1
Okay. Well, I went to this little terrible Methodist College called Albion College in Albion, Michigan. And we had to live in the dormitory. And they had a dormitory radio station, what they call Closed channel. You could just hear it in the dorm.

[00:07:04.990] - Speaker 2
Closed Circuit, we called it.

[00:07:06.920] - Speaker 1
Closed Circuit. Yeah, that is it. So they had this little radio station in our dorm. And one day, a guy I knew was doing a radio show in there, and he said he was tired of it and he wanted to quit. And did I want to do it? And I said, yes, I want to do it. So I had a Rhythm and Blue show from seven to eight in the morning one day at least. Up in the morning I was hanging off to school by Chuck Berry. That was my theme, John. I did this show for a while. And one day, in the afternoon, I had a knock on the door and I went to the door and it was the campus Beatnik was at my door. They only had one. He was wearing his sandals and his turtle neck shirt. And he said, Are you John Sinclair? I looked like a square. I was trying to sit in to college. Methodically, I was still in the same place, but physically, I was wearing the crew neck. So he said, Are you John Sinclair? And I said, Yes, I am. He said, Was that you on the radio this morning?

[00:08:12.920] - Speaker 1
I said, That was me. He said, Where did you get those records? And I said, They're my records. He said, Wow. So we sat down and played records for about three hours. It was a rhythm of woods from there, from Detroit. And after We played records, didn't even go to dinner, which I always say, If you know me, that's a big deal. I don't miss dinner. I don't miss too many getters. So then at one point, he looked at me and he said, Are you up to jazz? I said, I don't think so. I don't think I ever heard any. So he grabbed me by the arm, literally grabbed me by the arm and dragged me up to his room on the second floor, and he set me down. And he played Digg by Miles Davis, who was taking me clean in Sunny Mountain. So I started right at the top.

[00:09:09.500] - Speaker 2
And did you love it right from the start?

[00:09:13.580] - Speaker 1
By the time that record was over, I was done. I've been there ever since. That was 1960.

[00:09:21.960] - Speaker 2
Did you ever have another experience like that since that, where something new hit you and took you over or since 1960, it's been jazz, RnB, and blues?

[00:09:34.570] - Speaker 1
When I heard the MC5, I thought they were a fantastic rock and roll band. I thought they were fantastic. They improvised. They closed every show with a free jazz number called Black to Calm. Different every night, made up the lyrics. So I really like that, but it wasn't a life-changing experience. I became a big fan. I went to every gig they played, and then I became their manager.

[00:10:05.000] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the scene in Detroit at that time. Who else was there besides the MC5? What were the type of places that they would play at? How many people would be there? Tell me everything.

[00:10:17.420] - Speaker 1
When I first heard the MC5, it was in 1966. In those days, when a band had a record out, they played DJ Hops. For a DJ on the radio, and he would play the record and they would sing it live, not only on TV, but also if you wanted to dance with Jerry Rubin, and then your band showed up, but you didn't play a song, you just switched it on the stage. Pretty fucking primitive.

[00:10:56.000] - Speaker 2
Got to start somewhere, right?

[00:10:58.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you got to start somewhere. So then when I saw the MC5 the first time, there was a guy named Jerry Goodwin on WKNR, and he was a popular disk juggie, and he let the bands play at the State Fair. And he had a constant stream of band, but they actually came on and played. In those days, a rock and roll band had to look like the Beatles. They had the same haircuts. To get gigs, you had to play the hits. So a band like MC5, which was trying to develop its own music, but they all started out by playing the hits by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The MC5's first '45 was a song by them. So in October 1966, the guy named Russ Giff opened a place called the Grande Barroom. That's G-R-A-N-D-E Grande. It was an old fashioned ballroom from the '20s. He was inspired by his trip to San Francisco, where he went to the Avalon and the Film Hall. Then he came back to Detroit and he thought they should have a place like this and it should feature original music. That was the turning point here. When the Grande opened, in order to get a gig, you had to have your own tunes.

[00:12:21.070] - Speaker 1
That was totally different from before when you couldn't get a gig with your own tunes. So this is a big breakthrough. And a lot of bands developed as a result of having a place. That opportunity in art makes the world a difference. If they aren't allowing this, you don't really develop anything in that area. But if they do allow it, it opens it up and all kinds of shit happens. So in this case, all these bands were competing to play at the Grande Forum, which was the hippest venue from Lousy Mountain to Chicago. So then you developed a whole generation of bands that played original music, and they were trying to better themselves, and they were developing this at heart. I couldn't have articulated that. I could Because I was out of the art beating it, poetry tradition. But they didn't know nothing about art, but they knew they wanted to have some original tunes, express themselves. And so you had a whole generation of sons. You haven't I'm glad the Stooges came behind us out of Ann Arbor, the Third Power, the Rationals, the SRC. I could go on and on.

[00:13:41.230] - Speaker 2
Were you guys all friends?

[00:13:43.200] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Not everybody was trans. It's a beautiful thing.

[00:13:47.740] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. What was Trans Love energies?

[00:13:51.590] - Speaker 1
Well, that was a group we formed to create some structure to be useful to the hippie movement that was developing in Detroit. So we were a collective. I am in a commune, but we had a collective of other communes and bands, white shows, underground newspaper. All the It came to that had a left-wing cultural tendency came under our purview. And what we do is help a band get some gigs. If a band developed and we thought they sounded good, we would tell them, Well, skip it. Hire them at the grandi. We were advocates. When Russ Gibb started in the Grande Balmy, he was looking for a band, it would be like the house band, so he came to our place to hear the MC5. That's where they practice.

[00:14:44.130] - Speaker 2
That sounds great. And it sounds like it wasn't a commercial endeavor. It was you wanted to spread music.

[00:14:49.940] - Speaker 1
We were on acid. Money, we would have burned in a foreign furnace. We weren't afraid of the authorities. We weren't afraid of anything except God. We weren't too sure about God.

[00:15:03.270] - Speaker 2
When did you first try acid?

[00:15:05.920] - Speaker 1
Well, I took Bayot in October '63. That was a life-changing experience. I'd never been the same since.

[00:15:14.340] - Speaker 2
Describe how you're different after than before?

[00:15:17.420] - Speaker 1
Well, if you're lucky, you learn that you're just a small piece of debris in the universe. If Everything is much bigger than you or me, that we're just here. They call it ego loss. You don't care if you live or die, you don't care if you're just here. Whatever happens, you're going to try to make the best of it, and you're going to try and create stuff to make things better. The thing about acid is all of a sudden you see through all the illusions that they taught you. That's what happens. The main thing, and then you develop according to your own personality, some form of way to deal with shit afterwards. But the first thing is you realize that God and the President, the police, all this is just horse shit, if I may say so. So then you go on from there. That really removes you from the constraint of daily life for most citizens, you see. That's a beautiful thing. You have the freedom of mind in order to do things that haven't been done before because that's what you're trying to find, what hasn't been done before. Originality. That was a key concept to everything you did.

[00:16:46.200] - Speaker 2
When did you first get into marijuana? You're heavily associated with marijuana.

[00:16:51.130] - Speaker 1
62.

[00:16:51.980] - Speaker 2
62?

[00:16:53.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah. January.

[00:16:54.830] - Speaker 2
Was that life-changing as well?

[00:16:56.960] - Speaker 1
Well, it was more subtle. I I was a severe beer drinker as a teenager. Then I got into pills. So one day, a guy said to me, What are you taking them pills for? Try this. And he hands me a joint. I thought it was superior as far as the way of getting high. You get high in a whole different way. And it was very cool. I stuck with that. No, they don't talk about that too much about the greatness of getting high.

[00:17:34.230] - Speaker 2
Let's talk about it. Tell me.

[00:17:36.040] - Speaker 1
I mean, but it isn't part of the rhetoric. This huge industry they're creating now to sell you marijuana products. They don't say nothing about getting high. I mean, it's a known subtext. You know what I'm saying?

[00:17:57.250] - Speaker 2
You're saying the primary function of it is not what's being talked about.

[00:18:01.420] - Speaker 1
Right, exactly.

[00:18:02.410] - Speaker 2
It's just now the commodification. That's all.

[00:18:04.890] - Speaker 1
Getting high is totally opposite to what they want today, you see? They don't want to either be high. I've always continued That was their beef with marijuana. It made you don't want to go to work. These are people that work means everything. Then you get your products. If you don't go to work, you don't have to get the products. Rocks, you see? It's a revolutionary thing in the context of capitalist society, to me.

[00:18:37.470] - Speaker 2
Yeah. How has marijuana changed over the course of your life, this substance?

[00:18:42.180] - Speaker 1
Well, it's still the same. You still get high or you don't get high. It's either good or it is... They got 10 million brands now, but that's all just part of trying to interface with the commercial culture. I don't pay any attention to brands. They give me about 50 different brands every month. And here in Michigan, we legalized medical marijuana in 2008, and you can have a caregiver. So since 2008, I've had a caregiver I haven't paid a dime for a week in the last 15 years.

[00:19:18.890] - Speaker 2
Congratulations.

[00:19:22.410] - Speaker 1
What more can you ask for? That's a.

[00:19:27.670] - Speaker 2
When did you first get into politics?

[00:19:29.920] - Speaker 1
I always had left wing tendencies, even when I was a teenager. I idolized Fidel Castro, for example, but I didn't know nothing about politics at that time. I just say I met. To say I was I was attracted to anything different from the mainstream. I was always attracted. But I didn't really get involved in doing things until I was persecuted by the police for marijuana use. Then I thought, I got back. Eventually, I overturned the marijuana laws, but I had to do two and a half years in prison before that happened.

[00:20:07.890] - Speaker 2
There's a story about Dynamite and the CIA. Can you tell me that story?

[00:20:13.710] - Speaker 1
Well, first of So in the fall of 1968, somebody planted some dynamite at a little office building, and I remember to draw attention to the fact that it was a local recruiting center for the CIA, for the U of M students. Totally illegal, totally outside of everything that was supposed to be happening. So some people, friends of mine, decided to blow this place up to draw attention to it. They didn't blow it up. They put a couple of sticks of dynamite in the front door. Nobody was in the middle of the night. We call it our own propaganda in those days. So I was charged It was two other guys with conspiracy to blow up the CIA bill, although I wasn't really involved. But I can say since he just died, that Pumpermonde blew the motherfucker off. He did it. He told me when he got back that night. I could never admit that, but he's dead now. He was very proud of it, and I was very proud of him. And I wish that had been part of this conspiracy seat, but I wasn't. But I was proud to be included. And so I was already in prison when they brought these chairs.

[00:21:38.940] - Speaker 1
I was in prison for giving away two joints of marijuana to a policewoman. I think I was included in this to keep me from being able to get... They wouldn't give me a bond, an appeal bond, like I was a murderer. A appeal bond is the basic amenity of our culture. Two joints of marijuana, there's no danger to letting this guy out. But they wouldn't let me out. And I did two and a half years before they gave me an appeal bond. I got an appeal bond because John Lennon came to Ann Arbor and played a concert for me. Stevie Wonder, Still Oak, and all Bobby Seale, and all these people came down to Ann Arbor to demand my freedom. And then three days later, I got out.

[00:22:21.420] - Speaker 2
It must have seemed like a dream. I mean, what's your first memory of the Beatles?

[00:22:26.220] - Speaker 1
Oh, I don't know. I was a jazz lover. Still? I got cornball. I liked the Beatles when I got the Sergeant Pepper. Somebody tried to turn me on the revolver. I liked that. But by the time Sergeant Pepper came out, that was the shit. Every American with any degree of intelligence owned a copy of that. And are you experienced by Jimmy Hendrix? We had a commune in Ann Arbor over a period of several years. Many, many people came in and out of When we broke up, the record collection was mine. We were inventorying what was left after all these hippies had been in and out. There was 18 copies of Are You Experienced I'll never forget that.

[00:23:17.690] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:23:18.860] - Speaker 1
That was the Bible.

[00:23:20.380] - Speaker 2
How did you meet Jerry Rubin? And how did you meet Abby Hoffmann?

[00:23:23.670] - Speaker 1
Well, I mean, it was all one big thing. Everybody was in together, and there wasn't that many Small community, you'd say? Yeah, on the national scale, very small. A couple of thousand people. It's right 200 people. New York, San Francisco, they had the big population. That would only be a few hundred each. It was very small. There wasn't a market for our music. Our music was not... Yes, they didn't have no hips until '67. The Jefferson Airplane yet was somebody to love. So that was when that started.

[00:24:04.590] - Speaker 2
How do you think the different branches or the different genres of music relate to each other? Do you think they carry different energy?

[00:24:13.080] - Speaker 1
No, it's the people. It's not the format. I don't know. I mean, like a blues with the flattered fifth and the flattered seventh, those are emotional triggers. So if you play the format, you get the emotionalism. You know what I You know what I'm saying? Yes. I don't know. I don't ever think of these things. I just accept it. Cool. It's either good or bad. You can either listen to it or you can't. It's like, wait. If you get higher, you don't. I remember in the back of the guitar army book, there were lists of the canon of books and a list of the canon of recordings. The way to have the reading and listening was.

[00:24:57.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:24:58.420] - Speaker 1
I love that A lot of people were influenced by that, I've told me. Absolutely. A lot of people, somebody... I had a guy tell me he went down and read every book.

[00:25:08.950] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:25:09.670] - Speaker 1
I did, of course, but I mean, it was amazing. It was small, small. When the Beatles played Detroit, they drew 16,000 people. Brittany Spears, she drew 15,000 people by raising her arm up. Who? When they They drew 2000. They wouldn't go out of their house today for 2000 people.

[00:25:35.920] - Speaker 2
And Detroit's a big town. It's not like it's a small town. It tells you how small the whole- Detroit is big then as it is now. Wow. Detroit's one of the top 10 cities in the country, yes?

[00:25:46.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:25:47.500] - Speaker 2
It tells you how small the whole world of music was at that time.

[00:25:53.030] - Speaker 1
Right. And it was totally outside the mainstream. If you read the daily papers from the period when our music was in its ascendancy, when the Grande opened, when the MCAP Clive and the studios emerged, you won't find nothing about that. Totally outside.

[00:26:13.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah, completely underground. It was a completely underground.

[00:26:15.980] - Speaker 1
That was the term we use. The thing was when everybody started taking acid and playing rock and roll, instead of just smoking weed and playing jazz, it became a massive phenomenon. It grew exponentially day by day. It got bigger and bigger. It was a beautiful thing.

[00:26:37.770] - Speaker 2
Do you think the drugs played a role in the expansion of the music?

[00:26:43.080] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Acid. These people are all taking acid. There's a Grateful Dead, the Big Brother, the Orphanet Company, Country John, the Fish. They were folk music players. They started taking acid, and they plugged in, they listened to the Beatles, and they wanted to do something like that. So they did. But the acid was a catalyst, yeah. Understood. No question.

[00:27:10.840] - Speaker 2
As a jazz fan, did you ever find yourself being attracted to heroin? Because heroin has always been the drug.

[00:27:17.030] - Speaker 1
No, no, no.

[00:27:17.900] - Speaker 2
That's always the one associated with jazz, though, as you know.

[00:27:21.190] - Speaker 1
Well, the guy who turned me on to weed, school me on heroine. In Puent, they didn't have any heroine. They used paragoric. So he took me by a guy's house. It was a paragoric addict, and had me watch some shoot up. That was enough for me. I didn't ever want no parts of that.

[00:27:38.470] - Speaker 2
I never even heard of that. I never heard of that word you said, paragoric. Paragoric?

[00:27:44.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was some thing in a bottle, and you cooked it up, and you shot it, and then you get big abscesses. This guy's hands were like footballs. Oh, man. So I didn't want nothing to do with that. I read all the things about all my heroes, like Charlie Parker, that were dope things. And it was always a bad thing. It was never a case of they shot some dope and went on and created musical history. They go history, they never put it that way. They shoot some dope and then they go to the penitentiary.

[00:28:22.610] - Speaker 2
What do you believe now that you didn't believe when you were young?

[00:28:27.360] - Speaker 1
Well, it depends on what you mean by young. Everything I believe now I learned on peyote. I was stuck with everything I learned on peyote since '63. Sixty years I've been the same way.

[00:28:42.580] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:28:43.900] - Speaker 1
My beliefs are consistent.

[00:28:46.060] - Speaker 2
Your taste in reading the same? Would you read the same books today that you would have read then?

[00:28:51.080] - Speaker 1
I read anything today. I'm semi-cribbled. My legs are fucked up. So I don't really go anywhere except to the doctor I have a pain in my head. So I just sit and read and run my radio station and write something once in a month. My radio station takes up quite a bit of time because I prepare 60 to 62 programs every week. Wow.

[00:29:17.370] - Speaker 2
It's amazing that from your youngest age of childhood, music on the radio is what carried you, and it continues to carry you. It's like it's- It's a religion.

[00:29:30.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was such a beautiful thing when I was a kid. I'd never gotten away from it. It brought me life. There wasn't a hip person in my old town. If you went to Flint, 10 miles away, you'd meet some hip people. Not that many. When I was in college in Flint, there was maybe 20 of us that were hip. When I went to the University of Michigan in those days, there were maybe 20 people out of 40,000 students. Wow. Both of them were squared. They made fun of us. They pointed at you. They pointed at the women for not having no bazars on. Nobody had long hair. Everybody's shaved. Every day now, I read the papers every day. I've been doing that since I was seven. And every day, you see these people that are running things now, and they all got beards, or they're black, or they're female. This is It's totally different from the way I came up when it was all white men. So it's all good. We're in a transition period, I think.

[00:30:38.390] - Speaker 2
Is Michael Moore also from Flint?

[00:30:40.810] - Speaker 1
From Davidson. He went to the same school I did. My mom was a great English teacher.

[00:30:46.540] - Speaker 2
Incredible. Have you ever got to meet him?

[00:30:49.110] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, I know Michael. Good people.

[00:30:52.200] - Speaker 2
I read somewhere that the MC5 ended the show with a mock assassination.

[00:30:57.010] - Speaker 1
Is that true? Yeah. The first time the came to America in October of '67, we opened for him at the Granite. They humiliated us. They made us set up our equipment around the drums of Ginger Baker. We thought they were the most awful famous motherfuckers in all of history. So they came back in June, I begd, Let us give to let us open for them again. So we got the gig. We spent two months rehearsing, trying to get ready to blow them away. We wanted to destroy the cream. We wanted to make it so they'd never come back to Detroit ever again. And it was going to end with an assassination. But by the time that point came in the show, it was 105 degrees in the grand. It was packed to the walls for the cream. They were huge. We just went on and played the best that could possibly imagine a band to play. And by the time we did Black to Calm, it was just in total pandemonium, which was just totally nuts, the best possible way. And then the assassination was supposed to come on, but it was still an anti-climactic.

[00:32:18.560] - Speaker 1
Nobody even noticed it. We had it all planned out. Our roadie was going to raise the stage with a flag and assassinate the lead singer.

[00:32:30.920] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:32:32.850] - Speaker 1
We figured, How could you go on after that? Fuck you, cream. Come on after this now, you motherfucker. Make a set up around your drums. Kiss my ass. There were a few more off-putting and ugly persons than English roadies, if you remember. Yeah. They were horrible people.

[00:32:56.580] - Speaker 2
What was the White Panther Party?

[00:32:59.940] - Speaker 1
White Panther Party was chants of energies morphing into an overtly political movement based on the Black Panther Party and meant to support the Black Panher Party who were our heroes. We go to the Black Panher Party with the Vanguard of the Revolution in the whole world, not just the US, because they were a black organization that was not racist. They dealt with you like human beings instead like some white devils. They were real Marxists, feminists. So we aspired to this, so we followed them. We read the paper every week. And one time in '68, in the fall of '68,, one of our people was in jail in Traverse City, Michigan, for a marijuana thing. He had an interview with U. E. P. Newton. I think it was in The Guardian. And they asked them what white people should do that wanted to support the Black Panther Party. And they said, well, you can't really join our organization because we got this covered. You got to form a white panther party and do something with these white people. They're the problem. And so Pauline read this and he thought, yeah, that should be us. So when he got home, it took a couple of months to convince me because I hated politics except for Malcolm X and Fidel Castro.

[00:34:29.420] - Speaker 1
Anything other than I'm like, I mean, I support the Black Liberation Struggle and Martin Luther King and all that. But I mean, I didn't believe in any of that. I believed in Malcolm X. I thought he was the greatest American of all time. And Humey B. Newton was right behind him after he got killed. That's what I thought.

[00:34:51.610] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get to see Malcolm X live?

[00:34:54.540] - Speaker 1
Three times.

[00:34:55.350] - Speaker 2
Wow. Tell me about that.

[00:34:57.110] - Speaker 1
I'm extremely excited. Of course, there were multiple events. So as a white person, you had to sit in a segregated area. I'll never forget that part. And there weren't very many of us there either. Because see, most white people hated Black people at that time. The number ones that didn't hate could be summarized in the membership of SDS. They were racist Americans, but they were trying to be better. But those were on acid. We had driven racism in none of our lives. That was important.

[00:35:36.270] - Speaker 2
Did you guys actually know the Black Panthers and were friends with them?

[00:35:39.880] - Speaker 1
We idolized and worshiped them.

[00:35:41.790] - Speaker 2
I see. But from a distance because they were based on the West Coast?

[00:35:45.120] - Speaker 1
Well, yeah, pretty much. We became close with the Panthers in Detroit, but they were not a very effective chapter. I was in jail with a couple of those guys, so that's how we began to tell you.

[00:35:58.860] - Speaker 2
I read that the White Panthers the Party became the Rainbow People Party.

[00:36:03.840] - Speaker 1
Well, right. Well, to be connected with the Black Panther Party, the first thing you had to do was accept arm struggle. You had to arm yourself and you had to learn how to shoot. We were hippies. We tried doing this. We adopted this, but it wasn't a posture that went very far with hippies. They don't want to go trouble. They wanted to get high and fuck and hear some good music and not go in the war. If you wanted to say four things about hippies, there they are in a nutshell. So the most farther we went, and of course, I was in prison. So part of it was trying to get me out of prison. And there are other people under attack for the CIA conspiracy and what have you. So we thought This really isn't doing us a world of good to be grandishing a bunch of guns. And plus, if they came after us, they would violate us. There's nothing that 20 of us could do with guns against the fucking system. So we thought it would be best to change our focus from this self-defense, Black Panther Party thing to something that reflected what we thought and believed and were fighting for, which was a world of rainbowism, which need I explain all the different kinds of people getting together without changing their colors or their cultures.

[00:37:40.560] - Speaker 1
And again, I was very much convinced to that. I wanted to call it the Woodstock People's Party because everybody knew what Woodstock stood for. That was the turning point in our culture, really.

[00:37:52.580] - Speaker 2
I read somewhere that the White Panther Party was never bothered by the authorities. But once the rainbow people came, that was dangerous to the powers that be because it promoted unity instead of pitting people against each other. I don't know if that's true.

[00:38:12.130] - Speaker 1
They didn't like either one. They just didn't like us. We didn't fit, and we were leading their people astray, their young people. So they hated us, but it was the worst. Not so much we were defying them and their whole culture, but they were leading their young people, their sons and daughters, away from the straight and narrow. Soon, their daughter didn't have a brazzera, and she was walking everything in sight. They didn't like that.

[00:38:43.660] - Speaker 2
Do you remember what the original Ten Point program was?

[00:38:47.260] - Speaker 1
Pretty much. I couldn't read it, but we adapted it from the Black Panthers part, throwing in our own changes, like rock 'n' roll dope and fucking in the streets. That was our slogan. It later became boulderized to sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but when it started, it was rock and roll, dope, and fucking in the streets. Catchy. Rick, I know you liked that one.

[00:39:15.920] - Speaker 2
Did the MC5 all live together? Did you guys live in a big house? Was there a commune?

[00:39:20.410] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was our concept. You'd be involved 24 hours a day with each other. You would never have to wonder about where somebody was coming from. You knew. You knew where everybody was, what they were doing. And also, of course, the economic factor. If you had eight people that rented a house, it was cut the bill in eight parts. You could do it. You could live and do your things which were without reward. Rock and roll was without reward at that time.

[00:39:54.660] - Speaker 2
Understood.

[00:39:56.070] - Speaker 1
There was no way you were going to get any money for this because it was outside the mainstream. That's not what they were looking for. They were bewildered and be followed by this.

[00:40:06.820] - Speaker 2
Was your guys commune the only one like that in the Ann Arbor area, or were there other groups of young people living together like minded.

[00:40:15.570] - Speaker 1
Other groups, yeah. Everyone had its own distinct identity, depending on who the people were. But basically, as an economic unit, it was unbeatable for a hippie to live in a commune. And then we took it to another level when we got more political and we revolutionized the commune way of life so that everyone was equal, so that everyone shared in cooking, cleaning, and childcare. This was mandated by the central committee. You had a schedule for every member, the hours that you had to spend on the front desk, and Entering the phone, taking care of kids, cooking certain days a week. It was very sophisticated when you think about it. When you look at that period, the main thing you think of is the oppression of the women. When you think of the movement, that's what the women all say, how oppressed they were. Well, I have to think that's bullshit. They could have done whatever they wanted. But in our group, the women were encouraged to take leadership roles. My wife and I Before any of this, we had the Detroit Artists' Workshop. We published little mimeograph books, and I typed the pencils. She ran the machine.

[00:41:43.670] - Speaker 1
So that was a reversal at the basic level. That was what we were looking for, ways to make our beliefs into reality. The commune was a basic manifestation of our beliefs, ground level. If you lived in a commune, you were on the right path. First of all.

[00:42:05.660] - Speaker 2
Did you learn about it from anyone, or did you guys just make it up?

[00:42:09.090] - Speaker 1
Well, you were on the road. Everything comes from on the road, bro. Chad Kerouac, the greatest American, one of the greatest of the 20th century, Alan Gainsborough, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane. They were the pentacles. So their ideas influenced and eliminated our lives. Not just their art, but their ideas. I think we got weed from Carol West. The idea we wanted to smoke some weed, you just couldn't find any. White people can have no option. Only jazz musicians and poets. Regular white people never even heard of weed. It was a narcotic to them. It was dope.

[00:42:57.410] - Speaker 2
You said earlier that when bands would play at the Grande, it wouldn't be covered in the newspapers. If that was the case where everything in the underground was hard to come by, being where you guys were, how would you get information from what was going on in New York or what was going on in San Francisco?

[00:43:17.120] - Speaker 1
We had this thing called the underground press. They've completely wiped. They've wiped out everything about our period. They've wiped out hippies, they've wiped out the underground press. The Black Panther Party is a cartoon movie about Africa. They wiped it all out because they don't ever want it to happen again, so they don't teach you about it. It's like when I was growing up, they didn't say anything about the labor movement. I grew up in Flint, Michigan, where they started the labor, where they had the sit-ins against the Buick, you know? Chevrolet. They didn't ever tell you anything. I didn't know anything as a youth about the union. My dad worked for Buick in the office, so he wasn't a Union man. So that's what they did with us. They wiped us out. One of my great influences is a guy named Rock Scully. He was the manager of the Grateful Dead. And I got to know the Grateful Dead from going out there. And then they came from Detroit in '67. We went on out every day for a week. That's what influenced me to become manager of the MC5, because I saw that Rock Scully and Danny Rifkin, the manager of The Grateful Dead, they were more far out than me.

[00:44:36.330] - Speaker 1
They were total dope feats. And yet they were managing this band. They were on Warner Brothers. They were doing a national tour. You know what the MC5 needed was somebody to take care of their business for them. And I knew how to take care of business. And so I just osmosed into their management. But Rock Scully. And then in later years, I got to know them again. And one day we were hanging out there. And I don't know how we got to talking about this, but he was saying they wanted to make a movie about the people's death story. And he said, But They gave us the treatment, but they took all the drugs out. The drug issue was covered by some roadies smoking a big duby. And that was it.

[00:45:27.340] - Speaker 2
Missed the whole point.

[00:45:29.330] - Speaker 1
Jerry Garcia He wouldn't make a move without the mural. I don't know if you ever read Rock Scully's book, the great book, Living with the Dead?

[00:45:36.860] - Speaker 2
No, I'll read it.

[00:45:38.540] - Speaker 1
Oh, you love it. But it starts out because you know how you set the tone with the first chapter? He starts out by describing a trip to Germany, and he describes how his job as a manager, his first job was to make sure everybody had their dope.

[00:45:59.220] - Speaker 2
Dangerous What's up?

[00:46:01.120] - Speaker 1
This is a true story here. Wow. Well, the underground press had millions of readers. There was an underground paper in every city of any magnitude whatsoever. There was at least 50 of them, maybe 100. So I was involved in this from the beginning. My pal Bob Rudnik was the coordinator of the underground press center before Tom Fersad. Then Tom Fersad built it into a huge mountain, and then became multi by smuggling tons of pot, starting high times. High times, it goes right out of the underground press and stuff because the thing got. But everything went from 100 papers covering everything in these different communities to one magazine covering marijuana. That's how that shrunk. They said it was Five million readers of the underground press. We had the underground press syndicate, which Rodnik was a coordinator of. The idea of the underground press syndicate is if you joined, you could print material from any other paper without getting permission or paying for it. Of course, the underground press, we didn't get paid. If you worked on the staff putting out the paper, maybe you got $25 a week. If you I never got a penny for all the millions of words I wrote.

[00:47:34.780] - Speaker 1
But it wasn't about the money.

[00:47:37.290] - Speaker 2
No. And it was all the information was passed between all of these little independent papers all over the country.

[00:47:42.880] - Speaker 1
It was your own words from your own eyewitness account.

[00:47:46.100] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:47:47.630] - Speaker 1
So outside of the news.

[00:47:50.930] - Speaker 2
Amazing. Totally.

[00:47:51.940] - Speaker 1
And then if you look back at them, it had a tremendous influence on the Daily Paper. Our little paper in Detroit Design influenced the Daily Paper to an incredible degree. You can look at them before and after and see the effect we had up. Because we made the papers in the works of art. The San Francisco Oracle was the pinnacle of this. But every paper had its own artist, had its own logo, had its own typefaces. So cool. And it all dealt with the shit that was going on in the community underground.

[00:48:29.860] - Speaker 2
Would you say it was like the internet before the internet in a way?

[00:48:34.280] - Speaker 1
Well, it was much more pointed. The internet's wide open. Anything can happen on the internet. I mean, it isn't limited to underground issues. The underground press, we dealt with the war, women's rights, gay rights, capitalism, strikes, anything against the government.

[00:48:57.700] - Speaker 2
Anything that you see any parallel else today in the way people feel towards the government versus the '60s?

[00:49:06.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the Republicans hate the government.

[00:49:08.910] - Speaker 2
Was that always the case?

[00:49:10.690] - Speaker 1
Republicans were the government.

[00:49:12.810] - Speaker 2
So what changed?

[00:49:15.060] - Speaker 1
They did. They became more venal, more greedy. They got to the point where ideology doesn't mean anything. Winning means everything. Getting their way means everything. This This is the most incredible change to me in my lifetime. The Republican Party is against the FBI.

[00:49:37.060] - Speaker 2
And they used to be the FBI, you're saying?

[00:49:40.010] - Speaker 1
They were the FBI. There was a Republican Party, the CIA, the FBI. They were one group. Could you imagine the Republican Party being against the FBI?

[00:49:51.370] - Speaker 2
So do you feel like the sides switched? What happened?

[00:49:55.710] - Speaker 1
Well, they started losing. We started having more switched. It's all played out in the papers every day. Our ideas start to overpower their ideas, and so now they're using their power to overpower our ideas. But it's a culture war. It's like they say.

[00:50:16.550] - Speaker 2
Why was the first MC5 album a live album?

[00:50:21.230] - Speaker 1
Well, we were a live group. I wanted to make the point that this is what they did. See, the MC5 was the most exciting live band of all time, in my opinion. I never seen nothing or heard of nothing like that. When they got done with it, the place was destroyed. Then they worked hard to develop rock Bob China was a genius, and he was a performing genius, and he had a genius understanding of the stage and everything about performing. So by the time it was over, the audience was destroyed. They were laying on the ground, their heads spinning. I wanted to get this across. We had a live album coming on Elektro Records, and I wanted to be a live album. Nobody ever did that.

[00:51:14.380] - Speaker 2
I was going to say, I I've never heard a debut live album before, so it really felt revolutionary.

[00:51:19.900] - Speaker 1
Unlike today, where it's all about doing what everybody else does, only doing it better and having a bigger promotion budget.

[00:51:28.390] - Speaker 2
Did you meet Danny Fields? Do you remember any of the people from Elektra?

[00:51:33.070] - Speaker 1
Danny Fields, sure, he's one of my best friends.

[00:51:35.910] - Speaker 2
Oh, great. How did you come to meet him?

[00:51:38.670] - Speaker 1
Well, Bob Rudnik and Dennis Frolley had a column in the East Village There was another newspaper, the Weeding and Underground papers of the Country, you could say. It was called Cocaine Karma. Back before anybody ever heard of cocaine. It was in the '60s. They got a radio show called Cocaine Karma on a radio station called WFMU in East Orange, New Jersey, on the campus of Upsalaa College. Some freaks at this college took over the college radio station. They were the first free form station. Well, because the underground press, we got to know each other. Then the MC5, what I did with the MC5 as their manager was I created this unending stream of propaganda about how great they were, about how great the shows were, about the weird tax on us by the police. I was a columnist for the Fifth State, but I wrote these things about the MC5. And that's it. East Village, they loved what I wrote. And of course, being in New York City and being dope fiends themselves, having a hard time with deadlines. They would come up upon the deadline of I should have made it. They wouldn't have anything of their own, so they would take something of mine and put it in the East Village.

[00:53:06.140] - Speaker 1
Well, that was as good as it got in the other ground press. I also was in the San Francisco Oracle, which was the greatest paper of all time. So I was proud of that. But I got to be friends with Drednik and probably through underground press. On the MC5, we made up for this single, Looking at You, back to its borderline on the A-square record. So they bought it in Ann Arbor. Of course, we had 500 copies. Russ give $500 to $500 for this session, the 500 copies. We had 500 records. Well, you couldn't really sell them. So we used them as promos. So running in Philly, they loved their record. I don't know if you heard looking at you. Absolutely. It has been pretty far old record. They hadn't been any record like that with feedback and shit. Well, they liked their record, so they played it. So when I go to New York, they had me come on the radio station and talk about the MC5 to play the record. Well, the show before them was by Danny Field. Danny Field and Mernicke probably would bullshit at the changeover. So that's how I got to know Danefield.

[00:54:26.210] - Speaker 1
And he liked the MCAP Plus. Then he bombed to Detroit to see the MC5, and we had the Stooges opening for us. So he signed us and he signed the Stooges on the same night. Wow. They called New York and said, I wanted to get the MC5. I want to give them $25,000. And we can get this other band, the Stooges, we can get them for five. And so they signed both of us. So then Danny Fields was a staff member at Elektra. He was the guy who told him that Light My Fire would be a hit single if they turned it off the album. That was the turning point in Elektra Records. That was when they made some money. Never making a little money off of Judy Collins, but not very much. They were a folk music label, and then they had a hit single on '67 because of Danny Field. So he was revered. And they I took his advice until he got the MC5 in the Stuyge. And David Peel, he signed up. A lot of something to be especially proud of.

[00:55:39.910] - Speaker 2
Did you ever meet Jack Holzman?

[00:55:42.770] - Speaker 1
Sure. He was the President of the record label. He was like, Well, who's the manager of this new signed band? He was a lying, rotten motherfucker, if I may say so. Jack, fuck you. Jack was the one who took me in and put a motherfucker on the album and then took the album off the market when they got the reaction that I told them they were going to get, you see? So they're not going to like this. So I said, Oh, bullshit. We got to do this. It's important. It was so important that when the stores refused to stack the records, he pulled it off the air. It was at 90 with a bullet, our opening album. You know the record business. Our first week was 90 with a bullet. So we were barreling up the fucking charts. We pulled it off the market, censored it. Well, the censoring killed the MC5 because all of a sudden you were a bunch of punks. You weren't the authority fighters who were projecting yourself to be or being punked by the record company. Then they fired me. First, I got them over to Atlantic and Jerry Wexler signed them.

[00:56:56.890] - Speaker 1
I became friends with Jerry Wexler, one of my lifetime heroes. Great.

[00:57:02.130] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:57:03.540] - Speaker 1
I had all of the Atlantic records when I was a kid. There were no better records. I'm playing today. I played them on my record show last week.

[00:57:12.750] - Speaker 2
Did Jerry Wexler ever tell you any of the stories of those records?

[00:57:16.920] - Speaker 1
No, I wasn't in the nostalgia, really. We were talking about how could we sell the MC5. And he had the goofy idea of signing John Landau to produce them. And that was what ruined the MC5.

[00:57:37.250] - Speaker 2
Bruce Springsteen, John Landau? That Tom Landau?

[00:57:40.120] - Speaker 1
Now, before Bruce Springsteen, we were his stepping stone. And he tried to make an MC5 sound like Bruce Springsteen, which is really a bad idea. I don't know if you know their second album, the on stage album, sounded like the first album. And the one in the middle, sound like a monkey, the one John Landau produced. He told the bass player he couldn't play. For example, he made the drummer go straight ahead, where he was actually an Elvin no one's influence, rock and roll drummer. John Landau told him he had to stick to Booker T and the MGs, Elton Jackson. So anyway, terrible thing. After that, they fired me.

[00:58:29.590] - Speaker 2
When did How did you see the crossover from the short hairs to the hippie culture take over in the mainstream?

[00:58:36.970] - Speaker 1
Bootstrap was a turning point because before that, you see, we started out small, and then they tried to keep us small. Mainstream capitalized on the fact that we were underground. It's a tiny phenomenon that's going to go away. All this long hair shit is bullshit. You know, pretty soon everybody's going to be back in suits and ties. And they were wrong. And Woodstock came, and all of a sudden, there's half a million people in the rain to see Jimi Hendrix and Joan Baez. That was totally outside the rhetoric of what was supposed to be happening. So this was all of a sudden they realized that 500,000 people would go and sit there in the rain in a farm in outstate New York. It must really be huge. That was '69. By '72, they had taken it all over, and they had ruined everything. The underground ABC Network put out eight underground stations under their ages. And they were huge, so they wiped out the smaller stations that had developed this concept. And then they developed what has ruined the record company ever since is the Consultants. When you were coming up with music, the people in the music business love music.

[01:00:09.930] - Speaker 1
Well, they were the German Yobinskis and the guys like that who were creepos, but they were cigar chomping businessmen. But most on the ground level, it was all music lovers. It's just Jackies were music lovers. But most on the ground level, it was all music lovers. It was just Jackies were music lovers. But able to work for the record companies, the promotion men. They were music lovers. They knew the difference between one song and another, one band. This is a big difference, as you can imagine, because they love music, and that's why they were in it. And after Woodstock, they were in it because they thought, 500,000 people in the rain, we can get reach in their pockets and get $10 a piece. That's five million. So that's what they did. And then they got where they could just buy off the music. If you went wrong with the program, they give you a million dollars. If you didn't, they wouldn't give you a record contract. That started in '72. It's just getting worse every year for 50 years now. So you have what you have today, which is total ongoingness. That's why I do my radio show, my station.

[01:01:26.560] - Speaker 1
I want to create a reminder, a an artifact of the period, the way it used to be when you listen to the radio. I was on WWZ in New Orleans for 12 years. For 12 years in my house, the radio station never went off. And you never changed stations because they played all the good stuff. Well, that's what I'm trying to do with mine. I'm trying to preserve a little bit of that for the future.

[01:01:57.760] - Speaker 2
It sounds like a dream. I can't wait to listen.

[01:02:01.540] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I put on the 24/7 stream, and it's like listening to a radio station.

[01:02:07.680] - Speaker 2
What's your take on free speech?

[01:02:10.420] - Speaker 1
It means everything. What do you mean? I'm a living example of free speech.

[01:02:18.800] - Speaker 2
What was it like living in Amsterdam? You lived there for a while, right?

[01:02:23.300] - Speaker 1
Well, I spent 15 years going there for half the year. I loved it there. I'm trying to change it now, they say. I don't like the Third Light district and the pot smoking anymore. They got a government that wants to be like the US. They have 20 million tourists, but they want to get rid of 10 million of them. They're just totally not. They're white people. But this place has been like that for 500 years. That's the part I liked about it. Life is different. Nobody's unarmed. The first The first time I went there, about the third day, I realized that my shoulders were starting to settle down because I wasn't terrified of getting shot like I am here. Nobody's arm. You could go in a place and buy some weed and sit and smoke it with your friends without having to buy a drink. That was a beautiful thing. It just brought everything to the forefront that you think is important about life. And you're never bothered by police. In 15 years, I never had a conversation with a police officer. So it was my idea of civilisation. Might be there now, except I'm crippled.

[01:03:42.410] - Speaker 1
So I was going to go there in 20 20:00, and I got to the airport, and I didn't feel so good. So I went home, and the next day, I had a heart attack. So I'm going to think long and hard about going back again.

[01:03:57.380] - Speaker 2
You seem very strong.

[01:03:59.210] - Speaker 1
I am, except for my legs. They're not working.

[01:04:02.990] - Speaker 2
Tell me about being wiretapped by the government.

[01:04:06.300] - Speaker 1
Oh, it's just a way of life. You knew they were doing it all the time. Well, that was in our case. Against the CIA bombing. And in our case, under discovery, they wanted to know if any information on the defendants was obtained by wear tabs. And they said, Yes, but we can't tell you who it was because it was a case of national security. It turned out to be a cap on the Black Cancer part. Pamperman distributed 900 copies of the Black Cancer paper in Ann Arbor every week. So he was on the phone to him. They were taping. So the government says, We can't tell you anything about this because it's national security. Then it turned out that William Reenquist, who worked for John M. Mitchell and Nixon, the so-called Justice Department, so reviled by the Republicans today. But Reenquist had developed this concept of warrantless national security wear test. They didn't need a warrant of it with National Security. So we challenged this, and our Judge, Judge Damon Keith, in the Eastern district of Michigan Court in Detroit, federal court, agreed with us that this was wrong, that there was no such thing in America as a warrantless Wired Tiff.

[01:05:42.620] - Speaker 1
They had to be revised by the Constitution to get a warrant. So they appealed the judge's ruling, the government did. Very, very extraordinary action to take. But they appealed it. And we went up to the Supreme Court, and we to nothing in the Supreme Court. Wow. The ninth vote was Judge Rehnquist, who had been appointed to the Supreme Court. He had to recuse himself because he had developed this unconstitutional policy. Wow.

[01:06:14.060] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:06:16.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, they talk about the Supreme Court today, but they met William Rehnquist, Chief Justice. He was one of the biggest crooks of all time. He was Nixon Satchet man.

[01:06:27.610] - Speaker 2
You've had the most incredible life, I I mean, you've really experienced a lot of crazy stuff.

[01:06:33.680] - Speaker 1
As you know, that's the way we do this shit. Absolutely. We always wanted to do things different, and then we do it. Yeah. So you did. I've followed you since the beginning, so I'm a big fan.

[01:06:48.690] - Speaker 2
I followed your lead. That's how we do it.

[01:06:53.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I know. That's what I like about it. Here are one of the few examples of the good things that come with this. If you'll allow me to say so.

[01:07:02.950] - Speaker 2
I appreciate it. Thank you. What wisdom can you share from your life's experience that would be helpful for me to hear?

[01:07:12.870] - Speaker 1
You're almost Bob Dylan. You just do what you want to do. You don't do anything you don't want to do, and you do exactly what you want to do. I admire Bob Dylan more than anybody in public life because he's made of... He's my age. He's 82 years old. He just does what he wants. He's still out there torn because that's what he wants to do. He don't want to sit home and roll around in his barrels of money. He doesn't care about the money. He's got enough money where he doesn't ever have to worry about a penny ever again. So that's what important to me. Whether you got money or not, it doesn't matter. You got to do what you want to do. If you're going to the arts like I did, you got to understand that I did for me, Jack Kerouac, that you weren't going to get paid, that it was going to be a struggle, that the police were going to be after you. All these things were clear, but still I wanted to do this shit, and I did it.

[01:08:16.780] - Speaker 2
So you got what you signed up for.

[01:08:19.220] - Speaker 1
Amen.

[01:08:20.100] - Speaker 2
Amen.

[01:08:20.880] - Speaker 1
I never expected to make 65, so I never thought I'd be able to retire like I have. Because the government, $900 I got a month is a lot for me. It was a lot, man. Pays off my credit card.
