[00:00:07.320] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. I was 21 or 22 when I got my second gold record, when you were born in '63.

[00:00:32.610] - Speaker 3
Yeah, the second. What was the first?

[00:00:36.110] - Speaker 2
Did you ever hear, well, if you go back historically, there's probably no history, but it really is. I was in a band. Phil Specter joined the band, and Sandy Nelson was a guy a couple of years ahead of me in high school and out, and he knew I could play, and so I would be in his band.

[00:00:54.560] - Speaker 3
You played piano?

[00:00:55.480] - Speaker 2
Played piano. I, along with a guy named Richie Podler, Richard Podler, who eventually produced Through Dog Night. There was a Cozy Coal record called Topsy that was in the top 10 in the '50s, '59. Sandy, whose name was Sam Nelson, he just got the idea, convinced this disk jockey. Do you know who Art LeBeau was? Mm-hmm. Okay, convinced Art LeBeau who had Original Sound Records. He had had a hit with press snaps doing Bongo Rock, Mike Dacian guitar. Sam, Sandy Elson, talked Art LeBeau into a single, one-off, just not even an album. We wrote this song, in the studio, called Teen Beat, and it went to number 4.

[00:01:40.020] - Speaker 3
How old were you at that time?

[00:01:41.660] - Speaker 2
I was probably 17. Richard Potter and I wrote it. But Richard Potter and I were so young, we didn't know as writers how to really ask for writer's credit. That's high school. What did I know in high school?

[00:01:56.790] - Speaker 3
I want to actually listen to a little bit of it just because it's fun. There's different versions, too. But a Sandy Nelson version is the first?

[00:02:05.400] - Speaker 2
He re-recorded again because remember I said he got a singles deal? Art Lebeau didn't get an album deal, so he went over and got a little money from Imperial Records and recorded it and put an album out, and that's before Let There Be Drums. But this is significant to me because all of a sudden, even though Specter asked me to play piano on To Know Him is to Love Him, do you remember that song? Of course. Teddy Verse? He asked me to I played piano on it, but I had a date, but I had a ride to her house. So I took that option. I do not regret it to this day.

[00:02:37.770] - Speaker 3
So you didn't plan to know him as love?

[00:02:40.790] - Speaker 2
I was supposed to, a gold star, but I didn't go. I went out on this date with the girl, which I thought to this day, it still was a better idea.

[00:02:47.850] - Speaker 3
Describe the world at that time. Describe Los Angeles in what year is this? 1956, '55?

[00:02:54.490] - Speaker 2
The whole '50s. It was Pat Boone's Heaven. It was just Ozzie and Harriet. It was just- Had rock and roll happened on any level yet or not really? Well, I went to this private school called Beller Town & Country. Now it's called John Thomas Die. It's a big jail, and it's too expensive. One of the guys that worked there, he did a lot of jobs. I was up there because I lived down the street. So I walked there on Saturday, and I ran a Talt, what's his name? He had a Chevy with a good speaker in it. He said, You want to listen to some music Bruce because he knew I was in the school music stuff. He says, Listen to this. The station was called KGFJ that he got me to start listening to. We're listening to KGFJ. Then I hear a group called the Robbins. They were in stolen. This affected me and all Beach Boys before I knew. One day while I was eating beans, I spoke Joe's Cafe. By the way, the blah, blah, the guitar, Barney Kessel.

[00:04:05.330] - Speaker 3
Wow. Barney Kessel. Wow.

[00:04:07.350] - Speaker 2
Playing that before he played on the first hit, Liberty Records ever had, and it was Julie London, Crimea River. Here I'm listening a pure rhythm and blues with Barney Kessel. And then the other white guys, Lieber and Solar, writing it. Anyway, that's when I went, Okay, I get it. I got it. It changed my life.

[00:04:27.150] - Speaker 3
Did you like Duwop in general?

[00:04:29.950] - Speaker 2
Some of it was ignorant the wrong way. Some of the white guys didn't know how to do it. Dionne knew how to do it. The Black singers were cooler, to be honest with you. They sang it a lot better. But I love Duwop. Okay, I'll tell you my story. I grew up West Side of LA. My father was a pretty successful guy in business, and I went to private schools. I listened to a lot of music. In my appearance, this is our new book just came out, our first book. Great. The Beach Boys by the Beach Boys. I listened to all kinds of music. My parents played music throughout the house, 70, RPM. Was it really 70, in your home? We had a big house. We had a big house in Santa than a bigger one in Malibu, and that had the 7, 8 RPM. The LPs were just starting to get recorded and released in, but we were still 7, 8. But I was listening to South Pacific. I was listening to all kinds of things. I was always around music, so that got me started. I heard a lot of Sinatra. Then I picked up again on Sinatra and we signed a capital, and Nelson Riddle started doing the arrangement.

[00:05:41.820] - Speaker 2
Uh-oh. I'm slow dancing in the '50s, to eventually Johnny Mathis, but in the still of the night by the Five Satins. That was recorded in their church basement in Connecticut someplace. The Duops stuff is pretty cool. I'm listening to one day on the radio. Now we get up to 59. This made me go in the music business completely because I loved all this stuff. I go to the Hollywood Bowl. I was a seven, eight, nine-year-old guy with a wiped dinner jacket sitting in the box and all that stuff. When I heard the Flamenco's recording of I only have eyes for you, I went, Don't do it. I'm getting in the music business. I'll figure it out. I already had a fingernaail in. That's between listening to Elvis, my two favorite singers are Little Richard and Frank Sinatra. So put everything I'm saying in a blender, and that's what's sitting before you now.

[00:06:41.170] - Speaker 3
Yeah. Both Little Richard and Frank Sinatra are unbelievable.

[00:06:45.690] - Speaker 2
You know what's great with... And Rachel's, too. Sometimes when they get a little intense in the singing, they were always too close to the mic, and it would distort. You hear the distortion. I couldn't wait to hear that. Yeah, the energy of it. So I've been hooked forever. Also, I've been surfing since I lived in Malibu in 1950, 1951. I'd walk five houses up to the pier, and they'd have the paddle boards that you paddle to the race with the Cork in it to Catalina Island. Well, they were also surfing those days. They hadn't gotten into the smaller wood boards before the foam boards. So I surfed out Zoom all the time. Amazing. I'm totally into it. I'm not a prude. I just skipped drugs, alcohol. I just skipped all that stuff. I'm sitting in front of you happily doing 150 to 180 concerts a year, happily going to the beach. I wish I would have worn a hat because I got some cancer in my ears. I had that taken off. I've combined my sport, my music, and everything. I hope people, when they read my story, will realize you can start here as a baby guy and be the me guy and not be retired.

[00:08:03.170] - Speaker 2
Just keep going.

[00:08:05.810] - Speaker 3
Well, you do it because you love it, clearly.

[00:08:07.950] - Speaker 2
Oh, God. I do it for free. You love it, of course. It's not like I ever said, Well, come on down to my house. We'll make this track, we'll pay. I don't care about that. I just wanted to do it.

[00:08:18.680] - Speaker 3
Yeah, it feels so good. It's thrilling.

[00:08:21.290] - Speaker 2
It is thrilling. Here I'm, I'm probably 20 years older than you, 21 years. I'm still hooked. I don't need drugs. It doesn't get old. I just need the music. I don't write a lot, but when I write, home run. After the other 999 songs, go in the waste basket.

[00:08:41.740] - Speaker 3
Tell me about the world of surf music before the Beach Boys.

[00:08:47.330] - Speaker 2
The music for surfing, remember the Wollen Sack little recorder? You got to look it up. Fidelity was great. You could record on it. It was mono.

[00:08:56.760] - Speaker 3
It was like a portable recorder. A portable recorder.

[00:08:59.010] - Speaker 2
It was like the I had a Panpick 601 that Jan Berry used for Jenny Lee. Did you ever hear that? Of course. Jenny Lee and Baby Talk. Okay, but it was- Did you go to school with him? Yeah. I lived down the street from Jan. Jan and Dean. It was Jan and Arnie because Dean went into the six months army and then came out. Jan would come down to my house and play Duwop in the morning at 7:30. My father would always throw him out of the house. Jan, please just stop that racket. So he'd go up to the top of our driveway and we'd wait for the bus and he'd do my algebra homework on the... Going to university high school. So, yeah, we all knew each other and everything. Okay, now back to surf music. The guys that started like Bruce Brown, for instance, those guys, eventually got very successful with surfing films. They would have their Womensack recorder. And this before surfing they make up their own soundtrack, but it was more like Chico Hamilton, West Coast Jazz, and they narrate the film as they play the music. The guys were really young guys.

[00:10:13.370] - Speaker 2
They'd probably never been exposed to jazz, but they dug the surf. And they get high school auditorium at night, on a Friday or Saturday night. So they made their own soundtracks up. But they were Pacific Coast jazz. But somehow, somewhere, some unintentional surf music snuck in. Walk, Don't, Run by the Ventures.. Started leaking into the soundtracks.

[00:10:40.870] - Speaker 3
When you heard Walk, Don't, Run, was there already such a thing as surf music or no?

[00:10:44.970] - Speaker 2
No, it was jazz. It was jazz. It was like a late '50s jazz. Cool jazz. Cool jazz, maybe. But somehow that snuck in, and the audience has just flipped out. All of a sudden, it's something where they could pick up a guitar and play it. People would learn that stuff. All of a sudden, there's 20 surf bands. But it was inspired by the surf movies. Surf movies.

[00:11:12.280] - Speaker 3
That's amazing. I didn't know that. You didn't know that? No.

[00:11:16.360] - Speaker 2
Oh.

[00:11:17.290] - Speaker 3
That's great.

[00:11:18.840] - Speaker 2
I was asked to play in a session with Sandy Nels, and I played on it. And so I was in the band for one night. It turned out to be the first intentional surf recording ever made. Wow. It was called Moon Dog, D-A-W-G. I want to hear it. I feel like I'm tutoring you.

[00:11:40.610] - Speaker 3
You are. That's why we're doing this.

[00:11:43.800] - Speaker 2
Moon Dog by the Gamblers. Okay. Go look it up. The backside was L-S-D. I don't know if that was for the drug or not, but it was released on Pacific… The Gamblers. Pacific Jazz record. I'm playing the high piano and doing the hour. Yeah. Okay, let's listen to it because this is the first commercial record ever made for surfing. He was 17 years old.

[00:12:18.320] - Speaker 3
I could tell you like Eddie Richard as well.

[00:12:21.340] - Speaker 2
He told me he did… I've got vocals here.

[00:12:29.100] - Speaker 3
He did the vocals?

[00:12:31.000] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a couple of good guys. Nick Vanay produced it.

[00:12:41.340] - Speaker 1
What do you think?

[00:12:43.760] - Speaker 3
Amazing.

[00:12:44.450] - Speaker 2
It's pretty good. Who's the first band to have ever covered it? The Beach Boys. The guys don't even know. I never told them I did that.

[00:12:57.870] - Speaker 3
Is that true? Yeah. That's amazing. Mean, but that's the- You made this song. It was the first surf music.

[00:13:06.640] - Speaker 2
I showed up.

[00:13:07.940] - Speaker 3
Yeah, you were part of it.

[00:13:09.120] - Speaker 2
Like Woody Allen in the movie Zellig. Yeah. He'd always show up and he'd be around famous people at the turn of the century. Remember that movie? I love Woody Allen. Okay, so I just showed up and they're making, not my idea, they're making what would become the very first commercial intended surf instrumental with voices. That's it.

[00:13:32.230] - Speaker 3
Amazing.

[00:13:33.280] - Speaker 2
You found it right like that.

[00:13:34.580] - Speaker 3
That's amazing. It's so cool. Yeah, we could listen everything. When did surf music first start having vocals because it was instrumental for a while.

[00:13:48.070] - Speaker 2
How did you just hear it just then?

[00:13:48.920] - Speaker 3
I heard vocals.

[00:13:49.750] - Speaker 2
Thank you.

[00:13:50.400] - Speaker 3
Okay, what about lyrics?

[00:13:52.520] - Speaker 2
Okay.

[00:13:54.440] - Speaker 3
When did the lyrics come?

[00:13:56.700] - Speaker 2
I was taking my surfboard out in my car, and I think I was... You know who Paramahansa Yoganande is, right? Of course. Okay, well, it's his place down where no fear is, down in San Diego. Yeah. So I was surfing there.

[00:14:15.130] - Speaker 3
Self-realization fellowship.

[00:14:17.100] - Speaker 2
Right. Self-realization ship, the one down in San Diego, not the one in Palisades. So I was down there, and I don't know how I got the station on my radio. I was always messing around with radio because I was almost too far away to receive it because it was KFWB. Do you know KFWB? No. Okay. Oh, God. They played all the surf band stuff. It was KFWB, channel 98, Color Radio. Then they had a KEWB and a KDWB, one in Minneapolis and one in San Francisco. This station became the top 40 station in LA, like something would in New York City. And so they played all the hits, but they also played Moon Dog, and it was a hit on KFWB.

[00:15:09.170] - Speaker 3
Now, the only place anyone's making surf music is here. Oh, you're right. We're talking about a tiny underground scene of music, yes?

[00:15:17.380] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.

[00:15:18.570] - Speaker 3
Tiny underground scene of music.

[00:15:20.160] - Speaker 2
Now, we're getting it to the vocals. This is in the more official story. Okay. By the time I was 21, I was working on staff as a producer at Columbia Records.Unbelievable. How did that happen? Terry Melser just said, Hey, I'm getting this job. You want to do it with me? Okay, man.

[00:15:41.120] - Speaker 3
How do you know Terry?

[00:15:42.920] - Speaker 2
I met him because I should have brought pajamas. This is a lot of talking. So I met Terry because Jan and Arnie were signed to Doris Day's record label R. One Records by an English guy named Joe Louvin that claims he wrote, he's probably half right, Toody Fruity. I doubt it, but I see it in print somehow. Maybe he straightened. I think they had to take Toody Fruity's words and straighten them out so they were acceptable in the air. Anyway, so I thought, I should just go down to where R1 Records is. Oh, it's in Beverly Hills. And Terry was probably 15, 16, and working Going to school, going to Beverly Hills High School, but also, like my mom said, you have no character. I need you to just have a job after school. So the A's went to B's and the B's went to C, and I delivered liquor in the Palisades. Terry's the same thing. He's always working on the Chevron gas station two blocks from their office building on Canon Boulevard, with the label happening. So he's always hanging around because people bring him music in. So that's how I met Terry, and we were instant friends.

[00:16:59.390] - Speaker 2
Instant friends.

[00:17:00.900] - Speaker 3
Anyway- He was as into music as he were?

[00:17:03.950] - Speaker 2
When Terry got his job at Columbia Records, they just always, Doris Day, Sunday gave me a job. Really? You mean the guy who produced Turn, Turn, Turn, and Tambourina? Yeah, right. Anyway, Great. We became really good friends, and we didn't have recordings here. We just got together. He was a pretty good piano. Do you know what a fake book is? Yeah. Okay. He was so tight with his mom. His mom. Awesome. He had a fake book, and he'd sit at their piano, and they'd just sing songs together, and he'd play them. He'd play the chords. Amazing. Really cool. Yeah. By the way- Was she cool?

[00:17:44.740] - Speaker 3
Did you meet her?

[00:17:46.120] - Speaker 2
She's so cool. When Thierry and I had our little jobs at Columbia Records, she said, After you guys are off work, will you come over to my house? I want to play something. Okay. Because she still signed the Columbia She might have been 40. I'm not sure. Gorgeous. 59.

[00:18:05.710] - Speaker 3
She was-And a huge movie star at this time.

[00:18:07.680] - Speaker 2
Number one box officer on the world of female. Okay. We go to her house and she said, I want to play some music for you. And she plays us some Motown, especially Hitchhike by Marvin Gay. And she says to us, This is the music that's going to take me out of the music business and off the radio. It's really good, boys. I just want you to know that. Probably when my contract's up, I'm not going to resign.

[00:18:36.880] - Speaker 3
Wow. Isn't that a great story?

[00:18:39.340] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:18:39.750] - Speaker 3
No one knows this stuff. No, it's amazing. She was cool with it, and she sounds like she respected the music.

[00:18:45.940] - Speaker 2
One of the reasons she's so cool with it, you got to remember, she started as a big record star, big band with Les Brown, Sentimental Journey, and all that stuff, and then started making movies with actress like Jack Carson. Anyway, so she flipped over to movies, and all of a sudden, here's your record income, here's your movie. She was so successful, and I think she wasn't so worried about Motown ending her career because she hadn't even done a TV show yet. She was just a great hang. Yeah. A great hang. Great. Okay, now let's get back to the lyrics. Yeah. Here's the story, the way it's been told to me. Back Back in those days, people got married, really. Okay, we're getting married. We're out of color. Dumb idea. Dumb idea. Anyway, so Mike's married, has a little daughter, maybe two by then. Dennis Wilson calls him up. Mike, you got to come over to Brian's. Oh, wow, what's up? Mike says that... Mike is so funny. He said, Those are the years that I was in the energy business, worked at a gas station. So I'm delivering liquor. It doesn't matter whether my family had a lot of dough or not.

[00:20:05.660] - Speaker 2
My parents were smart enough to kick our ass, all of us. So we're all going. Okay, so Dennis calls up Mike, Come over to Brian's. You got to come over to our house. They still live in home. Why? Well, I'm surfing in high school, and I'm hearing instrumentals, surfing instrumentals, and let's write a song, song with words about surfing. Mike goes over there. He comes up with surfing.

[00:20:34.100] - Speaker 3
It was Dennis' idea.

[00:20:35.920] - Speaker 2
Dennis' idea to get Mike and Brian together, cousins together.

[00:20:39.780] - Speaker 3
But to write a song about surfing.

[00:20:42.450] - Speaker 2
Dennis, he's the pre-Edison Okay. Because he heard the instrumental surfing music or with the backup vocals. No, I bet you he probably heard my Gambler's record. I really haven't officially told the band yet that I did that.

[00:20:59.780] - Speaker 3
You You've been in or associated with the band for 50 years?

[00:21:03.990] - Speaker 2
No, longer than that. Okay. Since 1965. I see. As they say in New York- Did they still refer to you as the new guy? Well, not only did they still refer to me as the new guy, Are you Brian? Are you Mike? And I go, Well, if I had a stepstool, I could be. Back to the Lord. So Mike goes over. Now, I'm repeating Beachport history. I'm not a part of this. Mike goes over to the Wilson's house, and they start writing a song. And Brian was just still in love, of course, with the Four Fresh. It's a harmony. Oh, fuck. Anyway, they start writing, Surfing, Bum, Dip, Dip, Dip, Dip, Dip, Surfing, Bum, Dip, Dip, Dip. Somehow in the middle of all that, Dave Marx isn't in the band. He's 12 years old in the neighborhood. But Al Jardine had gone to junior college, was in junior college with that. The Wilsons left enough money for everyone to eat, whatever, the two, the parents, Audrey and Murray, and they go to Mexico City on a vacation. The guys get together and they decide they want to record their song that Mike wrote and Brian.

[00:22:23.140] - Speaker 2
They were running out of money. The guys needed to rent some amps and instruments. So Mrs. Jargene, Carl had a guitar, volunteered. She said, Okay, come over to my house and audition for me. To get the money to go and record surfing on Candix Records. And here's the song that they auditioned with. Talk about starting musically with the most difficult music you could ever do. So Brian taught Carl, L, Mike, Brian, not Dennis. Here's four-part arrangements of the four freshmen singing Harster Full of Spring Acapella.

[00:23:09.480] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:23:10.480] - Speaker 2
I know. I told Mike, I said, after Carl passed away, and I started singing his part, I said, That's probably the hardest vocal part I ever had to learn because it's,. There's a story told of a very gentle boy and the girl who wore his... Okay, the reason I know it so well is I couldn't learn it. So I thought, okay, well, this is years later. Whatever I was playing, I put it on repeat and went to sleep and woke up with it in my head. That's how I knew.

[00:23:45.590] - Speaker 3
Yeah, sleep learning.

[00:23:46.720] - Speaker 2
Carl, he'd learn it in two seconds because he wanted to go play baseball. So I'm like, Okay, Brian. Okay. And then go out and play baseball.

[00:23:54.540] - Speaker 3
What's the first time you were ever in the room with the Beach Boys singing?

[00:23:59.340] - Speaker 2
How about a better question? What's the first time I ever heard the band record? It didn't involve me.

[00:24:05.390] - Speaker 3
Okay.

[00:24:06.390] - Speaker 2
This is around '64. Terry and I are still at Columbia Records.

[00:24:10.610] - Speaker 3
At '64, you've already made a bunch of records.

[00:24:13.540] - Speaker 2
I already had my second gold.

[00:24:16.830] - Speaker 3
By '64.

[00:24:18.050] - Speaker 2
By 64. Remember, we're talking right now about the lyrics. Yes. Just don't lose sight of that.

[00:24:25.450] - Speaker 3
Yes.

[00:24:26.820] - Speaker 2
The first time I ever heard the and record. I walked in with Thierry, and I'm one of those guys, I know we're to be in the right place at the right time. I also know when to leave. I walked in. Mike could have been in his own, Mike, but I recall That's how they record you. This is pretty cool. Now, I'm not the tallest guy in the world. I walked in and let's pretend Mike's on his own mic, but I think he wasn't. So Dennis was even on this song. They're all recording around one mic. Mike was probably on this mic. So Jardine is on a riser.

[00:25:11.260] - Speaker 3
Yeah, to get all their mouths on the same line. Exactly.

[00:25:14.210] - Speaker 2
Now, I'm not singing the band or anything. I'm just sitting there at Columbia Records copying all the surf and the car songs. That was my second gold record was Hey, Little Cobra.

[00:25:25.450] - Speaker 3
Okay. I love that song.

[00:25:27.160] - Speaker 2
Written by the girl and her brother who sang lead in a half hour on the record I was supposed to play the piano on for Phil, To Know Him, to Love Him. Annette Kleinbarth. Wow. Carol Conners, who wrote The Rocky Thing.

[00:25:40.560] - Speaker 3
This is a lot of information.Un Unbelievable. Can you handle it? That's unbelievable. Yeah, I'm good.

[00:25:43.650] - Speaker 2
Here I am, you're me You're over there. Terry and I, we walk in. Brian, on the other hand, he has to lower his height to get equal. I'm looking at this area. Okay. Then I heard, Windy, windy, went right wrong, oh, so wrong, we went together I hear that. I thought, perfect. We stayed maybe half hour, if that.

[00:26:05.630] - Speaker 3
Were you listening in the control room or in the room where they were singing?

[00:26:07.950] - Speaker 2
No, I'm no fool. I walked into the room.

[00:26:12.970] - Speaker 3
You're in the live room and you're hearing them sing.

[00:26:15.440] - Speaker 2
You asked about hearing them live. Well, I'm saying I heard them live. I had heard them live backstage in other earlier times, but not when I was-But you can't hear live always.

[00:26:25.490] - Speaker 3
And I imagine then there were no PAs or anything.

[00:26:28.020] - Speaker 2
No. You had to have an your ear go around to the front of the stage so you could hear what was going on. Okay, so that's the first time. Fantastic song.

[00:26:40.250] - Speaker 3
But the voices, did it blow you away? Like the blend?

[00:26:43.930] - Speaker 2
I was asked by the Eggies to produce them, and I knew them really well. This is like 1972, three, four, around there. I said, I know I could write a hit for you guys, but the wrong guy. What do you mean? You need to get somebody who doesn't write a lot of groovy, syrupy ballets. You guys need to step up your tempo. That's right before all Disco Disco.

[00:27:14.270] - Speaker 3
Yeah, amazing.

[00:27:15.830] - Speaker 2
Okay, so there we are. That's the first time I heard the band sing live while they were recording. The success, lyrically, just locally, of surfing, It just started exploding. Brian and Mike, the surf phase of the Beach Boys was it lasted at least 10 minutes. When Girl Surf, Carl's School, it went girl surf, car school. It went on to all the The activities, people, they were just slightly younger than the band because they were out of high school just about with those recordings. So what are you saying about? What do you know? What do you know? High school. So that all happened. And So because of Dennis, lyrics began to arrive on the radio in the Beach Boys world. And then people covered them and everything. And then they went into the other genres. As I said, girls, surf, car, school.

[00:28:16.680] - Speaker 3
How many years of instrumental surf were there before that?

[00:28:20.500] - Speaker 2
Not many.

[00:28:21.620] - Speaker 3
Three? Two?

[00:28:23.250] - Speaker 2
I'm going to guess maybe three.

[00:28:27.400] - Speaker 3
Okay. At the time, would you assume this is an instrumental form of music?

[00:28:35.910] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. It never occurred to me anybody would write words about surfing.

[00:28:41.190] - Speaker 3
Why would you? Why would you? Because it worked. It was already a popular genre.

[00:28:45.120] - Speaker 2
All those shows all over Southern California were sold out in terms of showing the movie. These guys would four-wallet. They'd have the Wollen Sack recorder, and they'd have a mic, and, Hey, you and everything was sold out every weekend.

[00:29:05.240] - Speaker 3
How many surfers were there at that point in time? Were there millions of surfers?

[00:29:12.230] - Speaker 2
Thousands.

[00:29:12.840] - Speaker 3
Would you know most people? If you went out surfing, you'd know mostly everybody.

[00:29:17.060] - Speaker 2
Oh, I'd know the stars. I was a wannabe that knew I never could, like Jack Benny and his violin. Yeah, but it was fun. We're going back 100 years now with Jack Benny and his violin. But it was It was fun. The girls were cute. If we got cold, we'd just tear the wood off a classic, we didn't know it was classic, 48 Ford Woody and burn it to get warm. One of the great things about my job The job that I had in high school, I didn't like doing it, but I liked the results. The results were that every month, I liberated... What's the cheapest vodka? I liberated it from the liquor store, and I would sell 10 of them. The 11th one, I would use it three or four Saturdays in a row just to sprinkle a little alcohol on the rubber tires that we'd set on fire so we get warm. Then the other bottle was used for dating purposes. I'm not even 18 years old. Amazing.

[00:30:24.100] - Speaker 3
Oh, God. Who were the record companies back then?

[00:30:33.050] - Speaker 2
Deca, RCA, Columbia, Epik, and California-wise. There's always a lot of little independent labels might have one-hit wonders. But by the time the record labels figured out surfing, they'd have the astronauts. They'd have everybody that doesn't fit. They ruined it quickly.

[00:30:56.960] - Speaker 3
Was there a Columbia Records office in California?

[00:30:59.990] - Speaker 2
It used to In LA? Yeah. Knx was the radio station, and they had radio studios. And so they got converted into recording studios. And then in the balcony where they used to have audience in Studio A for radio, they stored all the masters until somebody said, We don't need the outtakes or the multi-tract takes, the four-tract takes or the three-tracts, eventually the eight. So they destroy them. Thank you. All Terry did with the birds, they just have the masters. Wow. Yeah. So we have the majors. Everybody couldn't wait to get to Capitol Records for the next 50 years to use their echo chambers. Well, the echo chambers that they used for Sinatra. The old KHJ radio studio became Capital Records at the gates of Paramount Pictures. Sinatra always had an audience. Probably people didn't know 200 people, all his pals just... And he'd record. They'd use the Echo over there for the albums that relaunched his career.Wow.And not the Echo that they...

[00:32:12.840] - Speaker 3
So in the studio, he always had an audience.

[00:32:14.870] - Speaker 2
Well, in the early days, I've got you in my skin. We small hours of the morning, great stuff. Yeah. Yeah, he's drinking, but he's hanging out. He was down to being $200,000 in back taxes, and he couldn't get anybody to sign And so Sam Weisboard, who was one of Al Jolson's agents when he was a kid, eventually became chairman of William Morris. And so no one would sign him. Somehow, they called Capital Records. They said, Frank Sinatra, are you serious? How soon can you be here? He got a one-album deal. And eventually, he inherited Nelson Riddle from Nat King Cole.

[00:33:05.520] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:33:06.380] - Speaker 2
Then they started just recording at Capitol in the old KHAJ building, the radio studio building. Wow, I didn't know that. The act of that echo chamber thing. Everybody's in when hiring the echo chamber for 50 or 60 years, and none of the magic magic was ever recorded there.

[00:33:27.400] - Speaker 3
At the Capitol Building, it's not there. That wasn't there. I had no idea. Amazing. Tell me the story of the Rift Courts.

[00:33:33.890] - Speaker 2
Rift Courts. Really cool story. Terry couldn't get anybody to sign with him at Columbia because, Oh, Doris Day, what does he know? Managers would take something play sales. So he went to one of the guys that worked for his mom and had the record label, not Joe Lubin. He signs these two guys and calls them the Riffcourts. He produces a song called Here I Here I stand in a lonely room. It charts. Terry says, Hey, Bruce, you know that thing I record? Yeah. They want to follow up. Do you want to work on it with me? I said, Okay. We co-produced a song that got to 40 called Gone by the ripcords. Then Terry said, I'll call David Kaeperlik, who eventually managed Sly, Family Stones. I'll just get you my job so we have it together at Columbia Records. We always would time our session so we could get to the Luau in Beverly Hills, that restaurant, the Luau, and in time to order dinner, 8:30. Anyways, one day, I said, We're going to the night? He said, Yeah, but we're going to meet Annette Steinbard, who was the lead singer in high school, on the recording of To No One Was To Love Him.

[00:34:52.080] - Speaker 2
She was there. She's still around. She's out of her mind in the best possible. She's so cool. Anyway, as I said, she wrote the rocky theme. She's there with her brother, and they bring Hey, Little Cobra, a lead sheet. We made a lot of edits. We didn't rewrite the song. I mean, it was their song. We start recording it. Eventually, a guy named Irving Townsend, who was VP of Columbia Rectors on the West Coast, all these guys are New York guys, and they're wonderful guys. He just said, Fellas, You spent too much money. You have to finish this by midnight tonight. It's like 2:00 in the afternoon. We are copying Beach Boys stuff. That was our current job. We just said, You guys, we're doing in a style we know you don't know to do. We're going to put a couple of voices on it for you. We wound up singing without cell sync on three tracks. We did no cell sync. We did about 10 and we do Hey, Little Cobra. Wow. Terry sings the lead. Let's listen to it. Ripchord's Hey, Little Cobra. That's just two voices, Terry and Bruce. Terry singing the lead.

[00:36:13.380] - Speaker 1
Hey, Little Cobra, don't I know you're going to shut them down. I took my cobra down on the track, pitch to the back of my Cadillac. Everyone was there just to wait for me. There were plenty of sting rays and XKs. Shut them down. Spring Little Cobra getting ready to Start. Spring Little Cobra with all your might.

[00:36:38.790] - Speaker 2
Shut them down.

[00:36:40.120] - Speaker 1
Spring Little Cobra getting ready to Start.

[00:36:41.760] - Speaker 2
Shut them down.

[00:36:42.640] - Speaker 1
Spring Little Cobra with all your Look at this.

[00:36:50.190] - Speaker 2
What do you think? It's fantastic. That's just us. It's fantastic. Free trip, free trip, free trip, free trip, free trip, free trip. Then I said, Terry, I got a great idea. We always dressed pretty good, actually, going to Columbia Records, you know. Slack, sometimes serious. So I had my coat off. Now, this studio, you could eat off the floor, and it was huge. And a guy named Chappie. He was the head engineer of Columbia Records, and the East Coast, he came out. He was an unbelievable engineer. So I said, I want to add something. Okay. I have the guy set the mic up, and I a trash can this tall, rubber made. I put it over me with the microphone here.

[00:37:38.680] - Speaker 3
Like a giant hat.

[00:37:39.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but down my shoulders. I went, Shut them down. Shut them down. Shut them down.

[00:37:47.460] - Speaker 3
It's like echo.

[00:37:48.320] - Speaker 2
I like Peewee Herman trying to sing bass. No, it just reverb. Like if someone sings in your ear, you hear it, he freaks out. I said, Wow, this is perfect. I'm going to shut them down. Spring lit. We're getting ready to shut them down. While I'm doing it, some of the coffee that's turned syrupy is dripping on my shoulder. I'm going, Oh, shit. Anyway, so those are the stories that probably aren't interesting, but that's fantastic. All right. So they send the record out, immediately starts getting plays, immediately. And so I said, Terry, those guys didn't send the record. Maybe we should put our names on it. Oh, no, I don't want to do that. He wound up, on my behalf, giving away any artist royalty on it, and it sold over a million copies. Amazing. Now, that's the first production that I have a gold record for officially.

[00:38:53.160] - Speaker 3
So cool. It's funny to ask you about the Beach Boys as if it's outside of you, but I'm going to- That's perfect.

[00:38:58.780] - Speaker 2
It's okay? I'm the perfect guy to talk to. Because I can be... I'm in both places. Okay.

[00:39:03.760] - Speaker 3
Were the Beach Boys a great live band?

[00:39:06.820] - Speaker 2
You should hear it now, even without Carl and Al. It's like Doc Severn said, Was he a great live band. Yes. All the arrangements, every note that we sing is written down. We could send it to schools.

[00:39:26.550] - Speaker 3
Yeah. Shows were short then, yes, in the early days?

[00:39:29.520] - Speaker 2
Shows were short. The songs were short. But as far as the parts changing, no, the parts didn't change.

[00:39:36.680] - Speaker 3
How did it work out that you were chosen to go to London to play Pet Sounds for the Beatles?

[00:39:43.720] - Speaker 2
Well, there was this friend of mine, Zellig. I'm not shy. I know where to place myself. We're talking about now May of 1966. Pet Sounds is released in America in mono. But unfortunately for Sinatra and the Beach Boys and other acting cool, they invented something called Duophonic, which just delayed one of the sides so they could sell it compatible with stereo recordings.

[00:40:17.970] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:40:19.210] - Speaker 2
Anything duophonic, just treat it like it's radioactive.

[00:40:23.830] - Speaker 3
That's unbelievable. It's so awful. I didn't know about that. Duophonic.

[00:40:27.910] - Speaker 2
I was so I'm interested in everything. I had to know everything, so I followed everything. I had heard that people like Keith Moon, who wanted to be in Jan and Dean or the Beach Boys, people in England were following us. The first year I was in the band, I made three albums and toured. Now, that's probably a lot, but not when you're 21, 22 years old. That's nothing. Okay, sure. And Chase Girls. Perfect. God, what a great job to have.

[00:41:00.920] - Speaker 3
Three albums in the first year. First year.

[00:41:03.600] - Speaker 2
I didn't start recording until those albums until May of '65. Brian had already recorded the tracks for Summer Days, Summer Nights, that had California Girls in it.Un Unbelievable.Okay? And then somehow, Capitol wanted something, so we slid in a... It's an accidental, unplugged album called The Party Album. And in that album- That was Barbara Ann. Barbara Ann by accident. I love that album. Al Kory was like running the Branch. Eventually, he was President of RSO, Beeches. He was running the Branch of Capital in Boston, New England area.

[00:41:45.520] - Speaker 3
I knew Al Kory.

[00:41:46.380] - Speaker 2
And Al was- What a character. What a wonderful guy.

[00:41:49.230] - Speaker 3
Amazing character.

[00:41:49.960] - Speaker 2
And just for the hell of it, he just sent out some acetates. You know an acetate is, right? Yeah. It's a radio station. They started playing Barbara Ann. So they did an edit, and that Barbara Ann has probably bought Fred Fassett, who wrote the words of music. Four white guys called the Regents from New Jersey probably bought in many houses. Wow.

[00:42:13.700] - Speaker 3
How did you guys hear Barbara Ann?

[00:42:15.790] - Speaker 2
Because it was a hit by the Regents before there was a Beach Boys.

[00:42:19.370] - Speaker 3
Okay.

[00:42:19.940] - Speaker 2
It was a pretty good record.

[00:42:21.420] - Speaker 3
I only know the Beach Boys version.

[00:42:23.110] - Speaker 2
Oh, you'd love it. Let's play it.

[00:42:25.210] - Speaker 3
I love it. Anything you want to listen to, I'm down.

[00:42:27.550] - Speaker 2
All right. You got me That's enough. So we sound just like them? Yeah. Let's see it. Isn't that cool?

[00:42:55.870] - Speaker 3
Beach Boys.

[00:42:57.950] - Speaker 2
That's You're singing the lead? Brian Wilson and Dean Torrance.

[00:43:10.710] - Speaker 3
Really? That's Brian and Dean. Yeah.

[00:43:14.410] - Speaker 2
Sing in the lead together. Fawcettos, dueling falsettos. The whole song. You'll hear it right now. So I thought I think our record's better.

[00:43:43.070] - Speaker 3
I love that record.

[00:43:44.020] - Speaker 2
Isn't that good?

[00:43:44.200] - Speaker 3
I love that record.

[00:43:47.130] - Speaker 2
Okay, so we had two weeks off. It's not that I wasn't one of the Beach Boys. I just wasn't. But I was in the band recording. Why would any the band think, Well, Brian will be on the road soon? Right. So I was just there.

[00:44:03.880] - Speaker 3
You were sitting in for Brian for the last 50-some-od years.

[00:44:08.470] - Speaker 2
Yeah, since '65. Okay, and that's cool. So Derek Taylor was our publicist. Now, there's a guy people think is wacky and crazy, and he's dead now. Kim Folley. Have you ever heard of him? Of course. He's one of my great friends. I hate it when I read negative stuff. He's so smart. His father was one of those B-Movie 40 guys with the double-breasted suit gangster guy. Then when he got older and a lot of teeth, he was one of like Gabby Hayes guy on Petticoat Junction. How are you? So Kim Folley was living in England, and Derek and I were talking. He said, Capital of Rocks has released Pet Sounds. Now, it was going to be released soon in England.

[00:44:57.500] - Speaker 3
Derek was already the Beatles.

[00:45:00.580] - Speaker 2
Beatles guy, now he was our guy.

[00:45:02.240] - Speaker 3
I see.

[00:45:02.790] - Speaker 2
Eventually, he went back and he was Apple, the Apple guy.

[00:45:08.230] - Speaker 3
So he moved to California, Eric.

[00:45:10.020] - Speaker 2
He moved to California, went crazy. He's a smart guy. He had five kids. Went back to run Applecore in '68 and took one of those big Tahitian, Hawaiian chairs like a throne from the Luau restaurant in Beverly Hills for his office right there. We're talking. I said, Derek, could you give me some ideas of what I could do in England? He writes several pages explaining England and London. He says, You know what you should do? You know, Kim Fowler is over there, said, I know that. He said, I'll pick the hotel. Why don't you go there and spend seven or eight days there and use the weekdays and just do some interviews? There's probably some interest in the beach for us. That's how it came apart. Amazing. I wound up doing about 15 interviews a day.

[00:46:07.350] - Speaker 3
As popular as the Beach Boys were here, they were both popular and seemingly more culturally significant there.

[00:46:15.870] - Speaker 2
Well, yeah, America. America got to get hot water. God, showers in the bathroom, everything. People were really interested, so the album wasn't out. But Capital Records probably pre-release, maybe. I think the international guys were a lot different of what to do than the American guys. I really do. Why do I say that? In the seventh week of the release of Pet Sounds, Capitol, decided to release the best of the Beach Boys album, volume one. That's insane. Seven weeks in.

[00:46:54.850] - Speaker 3
It's insane. It sounds like the Capitol was against you guys.

[00:46:59.890] - Speaker 2
They were getting against us because all they wanted was the girls' surf cars. They just wanted more summer. All they wanted was summer. Instead, they got, I know perfectly well I'm not where I should be. Do you still believe in me, I want to grow. They get that instead of, surf it. We're in the in the black, so they're not losing money, but they don't want to lose any money in the future, so they put the best up. By the way, if you were a bottom-line guy, that was probably a very smart move for a long time because it's almost up to four million albums. As far as our career and growth, Pet Sounds, that was the album. There it was. Week number 7, the very best of the Beach Boys, all promotion off of Pet Sounds. So I'm over there, 15 interviews a day. Keith Moon starts hanging out with me because he wants to be one of the Beach Boys, and this is my generation. He's hanging out with me. Every day, he brings about five uppers over. You're talking to a guy who just doesn't do any of it. Every day, he'd bring the speed over, and I, Oh, thanks, man.

[00:48:23.260] - Speaker 2
Open the door. Every day, Thanks, man. I probably had 30 uppers by the time it was Saturday in my drawer. He was taking them every day. Anyway, so he said, What are you doing? I don't know. I'm finished now. We did 15 interviews. He said, I got a TV show. You want to be on it? Sure. What's it called? He said, It's called Ready, Steady, Go. He takes me over to Ready, Steady, Go. We do a walk on and Benny King's on it. It's so cool. We just hang out every night. So I get back to the hotel Well, on Friday night after dinner with Keith Moon, and Kim's there, he said, he's in the lobby. He said, Oh, man, I'm glad you're back. Why? John and Paul are waiting for you in your suite, they want to hear Pet Sounds. I had a record player. They listened to it two times. They couldn't have been any cooler. They were dressed in Edwardian suits, and one came in a roles. I remember Paul gave me his number, and it started with the prefix Escher. And they were playing Black Jack with two fans, two girl fans.

[00:49:35.170] - Speaker 2
They'd gotten off after work and found out I was there. It was really cool. So innocent, I would say. God, except for the fact that Marion Rafeel got rolled up in a rug when there was a raid on the house, and they took her out. They took her out of it. Wow. She was... Okay, so anyway, here's how the Beatles Save the Beach was. They didn't know it, first of all. They freaking out. All they could talk about was Pets house and God only knows. Emi totally got with it all over Europe, and they released it, bang. Stupe John B, two days after I left, that was number 8. It was next week that I left, it was number 5. So the Beatles inadvertently really saved the day. When you go bowling and it bowls down the gutter and you get the bowl again, you got a spare. They gave us a spare on Pet Sounds. Otherwise, that probably would have been gone as an album.

[00:50:33.770] - Speaker 3
Were you there for the recording of God Only Knows?

[00:50:42.700] - Speaker 2
I was dating this girl, and I called Terry up, and I called her. There's a girl, Terry, and I said, Do you mind on the way to dinner if we stop in Hollywood? What do you want to do? I just got back from Japan, and Carl said, You got to come these sessions, Brian, the tracks he's making. This is before it was called Pet Sounds. I walked in with Terry on our way to go to Beverly Hills to go to the Loual for dinner. I walk in, and Brian's recording God only knows. I'm listening. Uh-oh. Wait a minute. This is really cool because Brian starts the first verse with the five on the bottom. So there's a do, do, do, do, do. Usually goes da, but he's I may not always love you. Okay, the bass note starts with the five. I went, What? And there's a few string players over in the corner. In those days, Rick, we had this wonderful thing called leakage. Now we were up to four track, by the way. But we had leakage. Hal Blaine would be the guy who'd run all the sessions. Terry and I stayed for about an hour, and I got it, and I thought, Always know when it's time to leave.

[00:51:59.310] - Speaker 2
Carl was in the booth with Brian. Brian's best friend was Carl. So I went to dinner. Okay, this is before Pet Sounds release, recording this stuff. So Brian just assigned us note after note, part after part after part. We just Sometimes, it just wasn't made for these times. We had everybody, including me. We had Dennis. We had six vocal parts. If you listened to it, it just wasn't made for these times. Part of it's in Spanish. In Spanish in the chorus. We make this beautiful album. Brian and I had a sing-off, though. I don't know if you'd remember on Sleep John B, which wasn't its destiny at that point to go on Pet Sounds. It should have gone on the California Girls album called Summer Days and Summer Nights. It was just sitting there, capital, that we don't hear any hits, we don't think. Wouldn't it be nice, God only knows? Okay, sure. Nice. They talk Brian in the Pudding, Sloop, John B, which has nothing to do with Pet Sounds. It's a beautiful recording. Everybody treasures it and loves it. During the recording of that, I talked Brian into writing a higher vocal note, and he couldn't reach it.

[00:53:18.930] - Speaker 2
I'm like, Brian, here. This should be… He said, I can't sing that high. Why don't you do it? Me? Yeah. That's the only time I interfered. But But it's just a technicality because it wasn't destined to be, as I later found out I was wrong on Pet Sounds. It wasn't done in the spirit of Pet Sounds.

[00:53:40.390] - Speaker 3
Tell me the story of the studio session for Barbara Ann.

[00:53:45.530] - Speaker 2
Well, the Barbara Ann Studio was just a Barbara Ann Studio. One night, we had all the girlfriends' wives would have come over and make it sound like a party, and we had potato chips, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, had made an unplugged album. I even played bass on a lot of it. Lucky me. The day I officially got in the music business, for real, was my first demo. I saved off enough money to hire what would be in the future the Barberian Studio, using the engineer that became Brian's engineer, Chuck Britz. When I made this demo, I was in love with my voice, and it so sucked. The song was terrible. And I sidebar to the sidebar. And I took the demo to Specialty Records because I love Little Richard. And I played it for their A&R guy there, and he had pocket pen protector or whatever it is, and source these shirt. He listened to it and he said, This is not what we're looking for right now, but Bruce, if you really get excited about something, could Would you come back and play it for us? Who was the A&R man? Sunny Bono.

[00:55:05.820] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:55:07.930] - Speaker 2
That's unbelievable. Is that not a cool story? So cool. Okay, so back to the first day in the Bar studio, in the music business. I was playing in high school.

[00:55:18.640] - Speaker 3
And was this pre Sunny and Share?

[00:55:20.560] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah, this was Sunny, but that was his job. He was an A&R guy. He wasn't down at Cosmo Studio where he should have been in New Orleans with Earl on drums playing a ghost foot pedal, and Richard sing a. It was owned by Art Wood, and it was up on just beyond where the crescendo was towards Hollywood, about four or five doors, especially where record's office, then studio. But they didn't cut any hits there. They cut him in New Orleans at Cosmos. It's still there. Okay, so the first day, I'm making my demo of this horrible song. There's a guy, Black guy, dressed pretty cool, actually. I saw him drive in in a four-door 1956, like a Coupes de Ville four-door. No such thing. I don't know what they call it. It's some a fleetwood. It was great. Had a diamond, pinky ring, a white tie, and a white shirt. He owned this thing that we all listen to. We listen to Huggy Boy on the radio here from the widest guy ever down in the middle of Watts, broadcasting from Dolphins of Hollywood. You can look him on a John Dolphin. He had record labels.

[00:56:38.040] - Speaker 2
He had everything. I had the Chancellor's daughter of UCLA, my friend girl from high school, Barbara Allen. Remember that? He said, Here's my card. Why don't you bring your acetate down when you finish? We went down there and the door was locked and there was a black guy, Percy Anderson-Ivie. He was muttering and pissed off. He was No, he's in here. Just all the Southern dialect white guys never heard before. I went, Who? He said, John, you owe me money. It's like watching a video of Stanger Lee. And he goes, No, I don't. And so the next thing I see in here is that guy shoots him five times in front of me when I'm 17. Schutes dolphin. Kills him. Kills it. And he falls on the heater and turns the heater on. It smells like crap in there. One of the guys in my band who is now first chair flutist with the LA Philharmonic, he's in high school with me, played tenor saxon. He gets grazed by a bullet. Everyone else runs out except me. So I stay there and I see dolphins foaming in the mouth dead. 17 years old. Wait a minute.

[00:57:55.790] - Speaker 2
No, I'm 15 years old. Excuse me. Wow. I'm 15. This February first, 1958. I'm still 15 years old. Okay.

[00:58:06.610] - Speaker 3
You just watched the guy get murdered in front of you?

[00:58:09.800] - Speaker 2
No.

[00:58:10.330] - Speaker 3
On your first day in the music business.

[00:58:12.000] - Speaker 2
First day in the music business. Because of Barbara Ann's Chancellor, Raymond Allen of UCLA, we kept about 99% of it out of the paper and we put it on over there in the ocean.

[00:58:28.440] - Speaker 3
So the story didn't come out.

[00:58:29.410] - Speaker 2
It was just wholly buried. That was my very first day in the music business.

[00:58:36.400] - Speaker 3
That day you knew, this is for me.

[00:58:40.010] - Speaker 2
No, it took two more years. In that time period, I was in Sandy Nelson's little band, and Specter was in it, and I listened to his chor, so I went, Oh, my God.

[00:58:51.700] - Speaker 3
What was he like? Same age? You were the same age?

[00:58:56.480] - Speaker 2
No, he's probably a year, two years older than me. He's very eccentric.

[00:58:59.720] - Speaker 3
Same A different school or a different school?

[00:59:01.870] - Speaker 2
Herbie, Herb Alpert and those guys, they went to Annette Kleinbard. They went to Fairfax. He was just eccentric. The title of his song, To Know Him, to Love Him, That's the epitaph on his father's gravestone. That's how he got that. Okay, so that's how I got my start. Then I am working up to Beach Boys. Our band that we put together took the place of the House Band for Art Lebeau because they had shows at Long Beach Municipal Auditorium. They had shows at Passing the Civic and El Monte Legion Stadium.

[00:59:38.350] - Speaker 3
You had to tell me about Art LeBeau, too.

[00:59:41.020] - Speaker 2
Well, Art Lebeau, he was just a great promoter. He promoted himself right into being one of the writers of the song I wrote.

[00:59:50.740] - Speaker 3
As was what was happening in those days. Of course. That's not an unusual story.

[00:59:55.910] - Speaker 2
I know. So Larry Nectle was a keyboard player, and Mike Birbani was a drummer, and they got hired to join Dwayne Eddy's band. So Larry, who became one of the members of Bread, and also got a Grammy for arranging with Jimmy Haskel, Bridge Over Troubled Water. That's him playing the piano. Amazing. The Steph with Art. Everybody does something. If you're hanging around long enough, something groovy happens. We get in this band. Specter's gone. He actually has moved to New York for a few months and under the wing of Lieber and Stoler. Who are LA guys that went to LA City College. They're the guys who wrote Smoky Joe's Cafe long before the two Robbins went to New York and became the coasters.

[01:00:42.400] - Speaker 3
They wrote for Elvis as well.

[01:00:43.780] - Speaker 2
They wrote Loving You. I I will spend my whole life through. They also wrote for Big Mama Thornton. Wow. They recorded this with Johnny Otis, like a 52, 51. You're nothing but a hound dog That was her original recording. When she met these two white Jewish guys, Lever and Stoler, with the song, she almost beat him up. She's about 6 feet out. You get out. Give me that. Johnny Oates is, Now, Mama, Mama. You got to listen to this. Mama, you could settle down. All that stuff is going on. Johnny Oates is on TV, by the way, local TV for two years. So I see James Brown in '57, '58 on his TV show. A first round of hits, Please, please, please.

[01:01:32.880] - Speaker 3
Was that another mind-blowing? Like, James Brown must have been insane the first time you saw him.

[01:01:37.470] - Speaker 2
Well, the first time I saw him live was '61 at the Paramount Theater with an 18-piece big band, and he would play organ in it and do all kinds of things, and his steps, and he had his ballet, and he'd throw it off and run back out. Three high school girls called the Bluebells were his background troupe, Patty Bell and the Blue Bells. Wow.

[01:02:02.120] - Speaker 3
I saw them. Unbelievable.

[01:02:03.750] - Speaker 2
I had the curiosity you had as a young guy for what was going on. I was everywhere. I was in Watts. I was, again, wider than Pat Boon. But it was safe then. No one gave me any crap. So all this stuff's going on around me, and somehow I'm learning how to surf, and I'm going to the surf movies, and I'm listening to Richard, I'm listening to Sinatra. All this cool stuff's happening, just influencing me. I would say, I only have eyes for you. As I said earlier, the verse are in du-op, and the choruses are, But I only have you. If I was for you, do, do, do, do, I'll have to listen to it.

[01:03:02.590] - Speaker 1
My love will be a blind love. I can't see anyone but you. Here comes the major stuff.

[01:03:53.580] - Speaker 2
This falsetto in this record, by the way. That's the Du-up slow dancing.

[01:04:06.200] - Speaker 1
The Moon made, behind. But I can't see a thing in the sky. I only have eyes for you.Fawcettle like Brian.

[01:04:36.570] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:04:40.280] - Speaker 1
I don't know if We're in a garden.

[01:04:51.660] - Speaker 2
Recorded track and everything in three hours and voices in New York.

[01:04:56.690] - Speaker 1
You are here. And so am I. Maybe millions of people go by, but they can't disappear.

[01:05:33.340] - Speaker 2
Check the falsetto, come on.

[01:05:36.250] - Speaker 1
Now. ( ♪ And I only have heart for you ( ♪ ( ♪ ( ♪ ( ♪ ( Isn't that a piece of work?

[01:06:09.700] - Speaker 3
It's unbelievable.

[01:06:10.780] - Speaker 2
It's like a symphony to me. Yeah, fantastic.

[01:06:14.220] - Speaker 3
What do you think that the Shoo Bop, Shoo Bop vocals? Do you think that that was because they didn't have horns? So it was like doing a horn part?

[01:06:23.140] - Speaker 2
No. What do you think it was? It almost sounds like Do What You Want or Shoo Bop, Shoo Bop. It's just what they did. Terry Johnson, who's still around, if you ever see a picture of the coasters, he's the guy with the Les Paul guitar. He did that whole arrangement, and they just went in and recorded it. Three hours, front the back and the mix. But that's very elegant. I could have you play part of a song that kept me in the music business. Just play a little piece of I'm not in Love by 10 Cee Cee. Okay. Everybody recorded every note they could record on a separate track, and all the voices are mixed this way. Great song, too. You know the song? Just listen to it. Recorded at Orange Studios in Manchester.

[01:07:27.230] - Speaker 1
Thank I'm not in love, so don't forget it. It's just a silly face I'm going through.

[01:07:47.070] - Speaker 2
So there's a song there being Son, besides all that stuff.

[01:07:51.550] - Speaker 1
I call you up.

[01:07:54.280] - Speaker 2
Just a little more.

[01:07:56.230] - Speaker 1
Don't get me wrong, don't think you got it made.

[01:08:01.140] - Speaker 2
Written by Graham Goulba.

[01:08:03.910] - Speaker 1
I'm not a love, no, no. It's become The whole thing's great.

[01:08:23.120] - Speaker 2
You know, I'd listen to the whole thing. I just wanted you to see what I did. Amazing. That kept me going.

[01:08:30.090] - Speaker 3
Yeah. I write the songs.

[01:08:33.920] - Speaker 2
I'm on the freeway in my Porsche because I could afford it. I'm listening to the radio. I hear, Joy to the World, joy to the... Okay, cute song. And then I hear, I believe in music, Mekdew. And then I hear, Oh, Girl, Lobo. I want you to want me. I'm thinking to myself, I can't spell it, but I think it's happening, Epiphany. I go, I should write a song about where music comes from.

[01:09:11.850] - Speaker 3
Great.

[01:09:13.000] - Speaker 2
I always like startling words It's like I've done a lot of Elton John's recording. I always like working with Elton because Bernie's lyrics are just so whacked out and wonderful. I always think, well, you got to have a really interesting first line. I went intro, I've been alive forever, and I wrote the very first song. Now, if you can't catch him with that, you might as well not finish the song.

[01:09:43.850] - Speaker 3
It's a good It's a good opening line.

[01:09:46.810] - Speaker 2
It's like, pretend I'm interviewing God.

[01:09:50.200] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[01:09:51.040] - Speaker 2
I go, God, tell me about yourself. Well, okay.

[01:09:56.390] - Speaker 3
I've been alive forever.

[01:09:57.170] - Speaker 2
I've been alive forever. I wrote the very first song. I put the words and the melodies together. Music and I write the songs. Hey. Yeah.

[01:10:03.870] - Speaker 3
It's ultimately a devotional song.

[01:10:06.100] - Speaker 2
Kind of.

[01:10:07.990] - Speaker 3
It is. You just told me the story, and I'm telling you, you might not know it. It's a devotional song.

[01:10:13.830] - Speaker 2
It is, but I never told Barry what it was really about. I said, Well, it's just about the spirit of music, Barry, because I know he would have loved it. Finally, after he waited a year before he called Clive back, when I was at Columbia Records, Clive was one of guys I worked with in the business department. When he called Clive back, he says, Okay, even though I think people are going to think I'm considered, I get it, I hear it. He put about 85 key changes, and he put every trick he knew, and it actually worked. Then three years ago, he called me up and said, I want you to listen to my live version. He had a live version with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, some venue that 18,000 people in England. It would shock you if you think the record was good. It's just all over. It's all over. It's called Live in London.

[01:11:09.740] - Speaker 3
Let's listen to it. Okay. Let's listen to it.

[01:11:17.040] - Speaker 2
That's it. We can hear them sing it. They are going to sing it.

[01:11:25.070] - Speaker 1
Then I'll tell you the arrangement story. I've been alive forever, and I wrote the very first song. I put the words and the melodies together. I am music, and I write the songs. I I write the songs that make the whole world sing. I write the songs of love and special things. I write the songs that make the young girls cry. I write the songs, I write the songs. My My home lies deep within you, and I've got my own place in your soul. Now, when I look out through your eyes, I'm young again, even though I'm very... Come on, sing this one with us. Come on, are you ready? I write songs that make for hope.

[01:12:57.740] - Speaker 2
Eighteen thousand people live.

[01:13:03.000] - Speaker 1
Nice. I write songs that make me young. I write songs... Great. Great. Oh, my music bakes a dance and gives you spirit to take a chance. And I wrote some rock and roll so you can move. Music fills your heart. Well, that's a real fine place to start. It's for me, it's for you, it's for you, it's for me. It's a worldwide symphony. I write the songs that make the whole world sing. I write the song of love, it's a special thing. I write the songs that make the younger girls cry. I write the songs, I write the songs. I write the songs that make the whole world I write the songs, the love is fascin' me. I write the songs that make the young girls cry. I write the songs, I write the songs. Listen to the music. I am music, and I write the song. I write the song. And I write the song. And I write the song.

[01:14:58.150] - Speaker 2
He's listening.

[01:15:28.690] - Speaker 1
You're cool, huh? Very cool.

[01:15:52.480] - Speaker 2
When I called Barry back, I said, Barry, where did you get that arrangement? He said, Are you kidding? Really, Bruce? It's your arrangement. I said, How could it be my arrangement? He said, You know the recording you made with I Write the Songs with David Cassidy? It was top 10, top 11, something in England. He said, I just copied that arrangement. Oh, because I did the arrangement. I said, Okay, cool.

[01:16:23.390] - Speaker 3
No wonder it sounded good. Tell me about the intro to the song.

[01:16:26.990] - Speaker 2
Intro?

[01:16:27.560] - Speaker 3
The cords before it goes into the ballad.

[01:16:29.510] - Speaker 2
I call that the doorbell.

[01:16:34.250] - Speaker 3
It's the signature of the song.

[01:16:37.960] - Speaker 2
No, it just gets you... Lets you know we're here. Pay attention to my song on the radio. That's why that's there. Then after that intro, then there's the engaging lyrics, I've been alive forever. Here, I'll turn your piano and I'll play you something I just wrote for Barry. Not a new song. I wrote him a new intro.Okay.Are you ready?

[01:17:01.200] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[01:17:02.780] - Speaker 2
You might like this. So it goes, Another melody is the chorus is...

[01:17:21.260] - Speaker 3
Right?

[01:17:22.750] - Speaker 1
So I put it in the intro.Beautiful..

[01:17:44.940] - Speaker 3
Isn't that cool? So beautiful. I'm going to name some names. Tell me stories about the people. Tony Asher.

[01:17:52.050] - Speaker 2
He's the sweetest, nicest guy. He was a copywriter at an advertising agency. Somehow, he met Brian, and they were talking about writing. And we, these boys, were in Japan for two or three weeks. And so, Tony and Brian started writing Pet Sounds. Is Mike capable? Mike Loeb, capable of writing Pet Sounds? Absolutely. Did you ever hear Mike's song called The Warmth of the Sun?

[01:18:27.030] - Speaker 3
Yeah, that's Mike Saul.

[01:18:28.570] - Speaker 2
He wrote the words.

[01:18:29.540] - Speaker 3
I I love that song. Thank you. That's one of my favorite Beach Boys songs.

[01:18:32.280] - Speaker 2
That's my favorite Beach Boys song ever written. Yeah.

[01:18:35.630] - Speaker 3
Well, that's where... We got to listen to Warmness of the Sun. Oh, man. Got to. Come on.

[01:18:40.810] - Speaker 2
That's the best recording and the best song they ever wrote together. That's why I knew he was right for Beth Sounds. He's very hurt by that, by the way.

[01:18:59.920] - Speaker 1
What good is the dawn that grows in today? The sunset at night, or living this way. For I am the warmth of the warmth of the sun. Within me at night. Within me at The love of my life, she left me one day. I cried when she said, I don't feel the same way. Still, I am the warmth of the sun. The warmth of the sun. Within me too now. Within me too now. I'll dream of her arms and who they're not really. Just like she still there, the way that I feel. My love's like the home of the sun. It won't ever die. It won't ever die.

[01:21:36.160] - Speaker 2
Iunbelievable.unbelievable.that's it for me.Breathtaking. Somehow, Brian would talk to Carl every night in Japan and tell him what he was doing, but he was doing what he usually did with Mike, but with Tony, and he was just working with Tony. What do I think of Tony? Yeah. Who do I think it should have been? Because I'm loyal to Leonard McCartney or Rogers and Hammond State. Mike and Brian.

[01:22:11.230] - Speaker 3
What are the inner band politics like and how have they changed over the years?

[01:22:17.190] - Speaker 2
That's just like these leaves blowing. They just change. They just happen. Nobody does anything mean-spirited. I just think Mike, never knowing that that was on the horizon, Brian should have offered it to his cousin first. Just of the strength of warmth of the sun. Everything's perfect.

[01:22:42.100] - Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you know Gary Usher?

[01:22:45.900] - Speaker 2
Very well. He was like a threat to Murray Wilson in terms of his writing and everything. He was a real ambitious guy, as ambition as the was, so that got in the way. What do I think of him as a great guy. How could I not like someone who wrote In My Room? What a great song between Brian and Gary. Great song. He was an A&R guy. He was there. He worked on staff at Capital. He did everything. He was a good survivor, and he died way too young.

[01:23:22.040] - Speaker 3
Jack Nietzsche.

[01:23:23.950] - Speaker 2
Jack was fantastic. Fantastic arrangement. Every place, everything he did.

[01:23:30.040] - Speaker 3
Do you ever get to work with him?

[01:23:31.950] - Speaker 2
Not really. I spent a lot of time with him, more because of his wife. She's a singer. She's so cool. She said, Terry Bruce, you've got to come here tonight. You're Laurel Canyon, I'm simply. She said, You've got to listen to this guy's songs. Freewheel an album, Bob Dylan. Wow. Gratia was… She said, This guy is going to change the way people write songs. She was so Yeah, amazing. That was Jack Nish's wife. Probably nobody knows she did that.

[01:24:03.670] - Speaker 3
Amazing. To a lot of us. Van Dyke Parks.

[01:24:09.560] - Speaker 2
He's not someone to dislike. He's too sweet. He's like, Kirk Betry. He's too nice But I know that he admitted to Mike Love with some of his lyrics. He didn't know what they mean, but they sound great.

[01:24:24.110] - Speaker 3
Okay.

[01:24:24.620] - Speaker 2
What can I say? He's a very clever guy, but I really think he took Brian off the path myself.

[01:24:33.930] - Speaker 3
Sagittarius, My World Fell Down.

[01:24:35.880] - Speaker 2
Well, I actually walked out of the session. Gary Usher produced it. We did it at Columbia Records. Glenn Campbell sang on it. Some of the people singing on it with me were singing flat, and I couldn't get them to sing really on key to my standard. So I sang it and just left. People love it, and I listened to it and something just says, This is wrong.Wow.The pitch.Yeah, yeah, yeah.The pitch.

[01:25:01.890] - Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:25:02.320] - Speaker 2
The pitch.

[01:25:03.120] - Speaker 3
You have perfect pitch?

[01:25:04.660] - Speaker 2
Luckily, I don't. You don't want perfect pitch.

[01:25:07.080] - Speaker 3
But you can hear what it's up to.

[01:25:09.290] - Speaker 2
I can hear pitch. Perfect pitch is something for people who listen to radio stations that sped their records up so they could get them over faster to sell more time. Yeah. And so you'd hear stuff and you'd go, Oh. Yeah.

[01:25:24.510] - Speaker 3
Lou Adler?

[01:25:25.800] - Speaker 2
Lou. I think Lou was born cool. Cool. As he got older and older and older, he got above the 100% mark for being cool without trying. He's great. Now he's 90 years old. I saw a picture of him someplace with Herbie. Herb Albert and Lou were partners, and they managed Jan and Dean. When they broke up, Lou took the management. Right thing to do, what do you think Herb took? The AmpEx 601 601- The tape machine? Yeah, the tape machine. And went down, I'm told, to Mexico, where they had the bull fights and recorded the olé's. Then he had a studio in his garage and started and recorded Lonely Bull.

[01:26:15.880] - Speaker 3
Worked out okay.

[01:26:17.050] - Speaker 2
When I was at Columbia Records, Cherry Moss in '63, used to come to my office working for a publisher and play me songs.

[01:26:25.800] - Speaker 3
Amazing.

[01:26:26.830] - Speaker 2
Herbie and I, it's not that I didn't have any It doesn't matter when you're young. Is there money? What? Girls, hey. I used to do a few sessions with him, and we got $10 a song. I'd play keyboard, he'd play trumpet in Sunset that sound or one of those studios. It's great.

[01:26:47.810] - Speaker 3
Amazing. Who were the Sleepwalkers?

[01:26:52.250] - Speaker 2
It might have been me. I don't know. I think Kim Folley named whatever I was doing as the Sleepwalkers. That's all I know.

[01:26:59.610] - Speaker 3
Was there a before that, The Barons?

[01:27:01.750] - Speaker 2
Oh, that was Jan Barry and Dean Torrance's High Y, like YMCA, High Y Club name of their Rough and Tough Guys Club at University High School called The Barons. Jackets, everything. The tears was Girls Club, Nancy Sinatra's Club. Wow. Cool.

[01:27:25.930] - Speaker 3
Mike Kerb.

[01:27:27.380] - Speaker 2
Fantastic guy. Just a real straight Presbyterian businessman. Loved music, but had to put a lot of stuff together. And now he still has the biggest in America independent label in Curb Records in tons of hits in Nashville. Great guy.

[01:27:52.330] - Speaker 3
Are the Beach Boys the longest existing band in history?

[01:27:58.570] - Speaker 2
Maybe still a living-ish. Yeah.

[01:28:01.410] - Speaker 3
I mean, Stones were after.

[01:28:03.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's good. Most people don't realize that Stones were after.

[01:28:07.090] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[01:28:08.340] - Speaker 2
Okay, I want to read you something. A friend of mine was one of the biggest stations in America was WMMS in Cleveland. Bruce Springsteen would be at the Colossian. The Beach Boys would be at Blossom. Laura Branican would be at... We'd all be sold out in the same night, promoted by the same station. That's how big they were. Walter Taberksky sends me this. He says, Thanks, Bruce. I'll always be grateful to you for your long-time support, encouragement, and guidance during my hazy-grazy radio days, Walter is a programmer, program director. I wrote Walter a letter. I think I was writing myself. I went, Walter, we all grow in our careers as we age, and my personal focus is to continue reaching out to humanity via songs I write to share how I view life, and hopefully my messages will resonate with other agreeable souls. I am always a positive person, and I hope my songs reflect that. Walter, no retirement for me, even if I'm on my back. I'll use sign language, if that's what it takes to deliver my message of hope, love, romance, loyalty, keeping the world's environmental issues center stage if corrections are needed.

[01:29:37.730] - Speaker 2
I'm one of the founders. I use the Surfrider Foundation to deal with all the ocean pollution problems plaguing the planet and a gillion other thoughts I have about living. Just saying, Bruce.

[01:29:48.820] - Speaker 3
Beautiful.

[01:29:49.670] - Speaker 2
I just sent that to him out of the blue.

[01:29:51.500] - Speaker 3
Beautiful. Tell me the story of surf riders.

[01:29:54.760] - Speaker 2
It's really cool. There's a lot of guys that got famous in surfing in those days. I know all these guys, and they said, We're working on what? We want to call this thing the Surfwriter Foundation. Let me be part of it. Sure you're in. In '84, we wound up having The Surfrider Foundation or surfrider. Org. You go to the beach and a little kid's there and he's looking at a Coke can and we say, Well, if you don't dispose of this properly, and we'll show you how to do it, it'll be there 350 years. We go through the place, we do that. We had us, we were the members. Anyway, guess how many members nonprofit we have? We have 200 chapters and a million members. Wow. Surfrider. Org.

[01:30:45.730] - Speaker 3
Wow. I heard a story that when Richard Branson started his new label, V2, there was a rumor that he was going to sign the Beach Boys, and there was an idea get back to the creative.

[01:31:03.750] - Speaker 2
Okay, so we had the most amazing deal with Branson.

[01:31:10.270] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[01:31:11.250] - Speaker 2
And we would be the first artist. Yeah. Long time. So everyone was for it except Brian's wife. And he said, Great idea. We should do it. But first, Brian has to have a solo album or we're not signing. Deal's gone. Wow. Not that everybody needed money, but there's plenty of advance and budget.

[01:31:39.030] - Speaker 3
Yeah. But it also seemed like a creative breath of new life from someone who wanted something great from the Beach Boys instead of what your experience with capital.

[01:31:50.290] - Speaker 2
You were exactly right. But I don't want to... She just passed away in the last two or three months. But she just said, Oh, Great idea, but first, Brian has to have his own album. And he said, Okay, of course, we'll make a... Here's the budget for Brian's album. But first, we have to do the Beach Boys. She said, No, it has to be Brian. Goodbye. Bang. Gone.

[01:32:19.830] - Speaker 3
Tell me about Brian. Would you say you know him well?

[01:32:24.280] - Speaker 2
I don't think so. I observed him well. That's all I can tell you. When you read our book, you'll learn more about the band as I learn more about the band. I read all the rough draughts and everything. It's totally written from Beach Boys. It's not Ghostwriters or anything. Things unfiled at Carl because he's not alive. Brian got captured by a lot of people, probably thinking, How I'm working with them. This is really great. I remember later in the Pet Sound sessions, people say after 8:30, we start bringing pills and things. With the sales thing on Brian Hey, this is going to really give you more depth of your creativity. It, to be just all the wrong people brought all the wrong stuff.

[01:33:21.730] - Speaker 3
I see.

[01:33:23.610] - Speaker 2
So did I know Brian? I knew Brian more like the sun coming out in Great Britain because it's so cloudy. You get glimpses of the sun. One fun glimpse, though. We did the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary, and we were at one of those TV shows that just sell clothing, sell TV, sell everything. I think we sold, like that night, we sold 30,000 albums just by going out and playing a song. That's pretty good. While Brian was sitting around, we were just talking with him. He was just being okay. He said, I had a couple of top five records that year. What year? In '64 and into '65. I also had a number one record here. He started going over all his hits just talking to us. I thought, Is this guy waking up, being healthy? He was just talking about it. It was so cool. Yeah. That's probably the last time he was really Brian. I don't know what his demons were or are. I don't know how much his medication helped him or preserved him or harmed him.

[01:34:47.040] - Speaker 3
As a songwriter, looking at Brian's songs, how would you say his songwriting changed from the earliest days along the way?

[01:34:55.380] - Speaker 2
I think the Beast Boys ended on that level with Brian maybe stepped out, but stepping back in with the recording of Till I Die. Have you ever heard that? Mm-hmm. Okay, play it right now. Okay. I think that's the last Brian Wilson Brilliant thing. He happened to write the lyrics. The last time he wrote the lyrics was Surf For A Girl, and then Mike wrote everything else, Till I Die on the Surfs Up album. Great. It's so revealing. It's fantastic. Listen to his harmony. We're in harmony.

[01:35:32.980] - Speaker 1
I'm a cork on the ocean, floating over the rage and sea. How deep is the ocean? How deep is the ocean?

[01:35:55.260] - Speaker 2
I lost my way.

[01:35:58.940] - Speaker 1
Hey, I'm a rock in a landslip, rolling over the mountainside. How deep is the valley? How deep is the valley? Oh, It kills my soul. Hey, hey, hey. I'm a leaf on a windy day. Pretty soon I'll be blown away. How long will the wind blow? How long will the wind What do you think?

[01:37:48.150] - Speaker 3
Heavy.

[01:37:49.840] - Speaker 2
That's the last time I heard Brian be a real Brian.

[01:37:55.210] - Speaker 3
He wrote the words, too? Wow. All the words. Heavy. You know?

[01:38:00.060] - Speaker 2
Heavy song. I wanted to give him some a psychological PhD for that one. That's just put us insides on the table and just sang about them. Yeah. It's inside thoughts. Very That's just me, Todd. Anything is me. I don't speak for the band. Yeah, no, of course. I'm the inside outside USA.
