[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. I had spent my whole life living in New York, making my record, being in clubs in New York.

[00:00:27.580] - Speaker 2
You make a record here, you want people in New York to bump your shit. You want people to be into your shit in the place that you live. It didn't do that much in New York, and it suddenly started to do a lot in England. So obviously, it was nice to have a place where they were digging the record. Then also, it made me think like, Okay, the fact that I spent the first eight years of my life in this country surely influenced my taste or did something more than I maybe absorbed before. Then by going back to England and just being around there and DJing in clubs there, I met Lily Allen, and then I met someone who introduced me to Amy. There was this feeling like, okay, sure, you like to go where people like your shit. But there was also more like, I was just creatively inspired there. After a couple of years, I went back to England. Then eight years to England, I was suddenly flying to LA all the time to make records. I was like, I'm going to just try and go to LA for a little bit. I lived in LA for four years, came back to New York.

[00:01:34.720] - Speaker 1
What motivated the move to New York from LA?

[00:01:38.580] - Speaker 2
There was this thing, and it's a slightly cliched New York versus LA thing that I just was like, I'm not going to fall into all those mental traps. It wasn't that. It was actually, I would just come back to New York for a weekend, and I would just realize how much I missed it. I felt like I'd almost been on a 15-year journey to somehow come back to New York. I felt like I went to London for 10 years, LA for five years. I knew when I left LA, I was like, I'm not going to be in the fucking thick of it. I'm not going to be where every writer and every musician, every pop star is five minutes away. In essence, I'm leaving work on the table, but I'm going to go back where I feel the most native. That's it. I'm here.

[00:02:24.440] - Speaker 1
Cool. How would you say New York has changed in your 15-year absence What was it like when you left? What's it like now?

[00:02:34.300] - Speaker 2
When I left, I probably left in 2008, 2009. The people that I was making music with in my studio, I think of even the rappers like Jay Cole and Wale and people early in their career. There was still very much the sense that LA was starting to take over, but New York was still a place for current, relevant music, whatever the fuck you want to call it, hip hop, pop, everything. And then it did feel like there was this six or seven-year thing where it was a little bit like tumbleweeds in a ghost town. I'm sure there were cool pockets of scenes going on in places I don't know about. Ridgewood. Shit was moving further out to Queens and Brooklyn. And then I've noticed over the past three or four years, it's really coming back. I think there's always going to be that cyclical thing. I think that there's very cool shit going on here. I think there's Electric Lady, which for a while, it was like that studio compass point in the Bahamas. If you're rich and you got a lot of money, you could go make a record in New York, almost like a vacation destination.

[00:03:43.740] - Speaker 2
Now it's come back. That has a lot to do with the culture of Electric Lady and Jack Antonoff bringing records in and big pop stars. Now there's just cool shit going on. I definitely noticed a little bit of a swing right now.

[00:03:59.140] - Speaker 1
Have you worked at Electric Lady?

[00:04:00.800] - Speaker 2
I have, yeah. I've worked there a lot. The very first record I ever made, first major record I worked on was this girl, Nika Costa, and we did that at Electric Lady. That was when Electric Lady had fallen a little bit into disrepair. D'angelo was just bringing it back. It was this place that was once great. It's fallen off a little. We went in there and it was mythical. I mean, A, this is my first time in the studio. I only knew how to use an MPC. All this analog gear and all this shit. I was like, because we were on... I don't know if you remember Dominic Chenere, who had that label, He Managed the Angelo, Dom? I do. Yeah. So he had his label with Nika Costa on it. Yeah. So we had Quest Love and Pino Paladino and James Poiz and these amazing musicians on this first record. I was 23 years old, so it was pretty crazy. But yeah, I've worked there, and I've worked there a lot since. But now that I have my own spot, I just try to stay here.

[00:05:08.600] - Speaker 1
How did Dominic hire you to produce Nika if you hadn't produced anything significant before that?

[00:05:15.880] - Speaker 2
Well, I had come up as a DJ. I played in bands in high school. And this is what the book is about. It's just the '90s. So it's really just... The very beginning is me playing in my high school band and then discovering Pete Rock and CL Smooth and just being like, holy shit, this is what I want to do from now on. I listened to Stretch Arm, Sean and Barbito, and that was like that I had a very nominal knowledge of hip hop and DJing, and I didn't know any DJs. I got turntables, started DJing in clubs in New York, just the hole in the walls, bars. I got lucky. I got a lucky break and got a gig at this club, Club USA. But over For the course of three or four years, I got good at it. After a while of playing just hip hop, I started to think to myself like, I wonder if I could sneak back in Black into my set because I would go to these other bars where they played rock and roll, and the DJs were not technically very good. They were just like, they were getting fucked up in the booth.

[00:06:26.020] - Speaker 2
They would play a song, there'd be a minute of silence, they'd throw on the next song. But people were just going batshets and like fucking dancing on sofas and going crazy. I had grown up loving AC/DC, but I was so buried in hip hop. I hadn't thought about that music for years. I just started to think. There was this big night at Cheetah, this hip hop club called Cheetah on a Monday night. And like, Missy and Janet Jackson and Alia and everybody went. I remember just thinking, I wonder if I could play AC/DC at Cheetah. It could be an absolute suicide mission, but fuck it, let me try. I was like, What's my foolproof way to sneak it in? This chosen horse. At the minute the song The Benjamin's was out, it was the biggest song of the moment. There was a rock and roll remix of it, which wasn't very good. It was a little probably trying to cash in on a rap metal trend that was going on, but Groal was playing drums on it. That was the saving Grace. I was like, All right, if I play the Benjamins, I'll get the whole club, and then I can switch into the rock remix on Biggie's verse, and no one's going to stop dancing because it's Biggie, right?

[00:07:45.150] - Speaker 2
Then right on the one, as he come out of Biggie verse, I'm going to drop AC/DC Back in Black. And tried it, and it fucking worked, and nobody could believe it. There was 500 people in Cheetah dancing to AC/DC Back in Black at first, being like, Are we fucking there? Oh, shit. We're fucking dancing to this. And so there was a little bit of a turning point in my career. Up to then, I'd been copying all the DJs I loved and people before me. Stretch, Clark Kent, whoever. And then I just started playing rock and roll and fucking everything, and Jane's Addiction, and Zeppelin, and AC/DC, and whatever. So I started to become known for that. And I would DJ at clubs like Life. And I remember seeing you there one time. I think Chris Rock brought you down because that was a very big deal. I was like, Holy shit, Rick Rubin, because you weren't somebody that people saw out in clubs a lot. And yeah, in this VIP room at this Club Life on a Friday night, it would be crazy because my DJ booth was this shitty setup. It was literally like a mobile bar mitzvah DJ setup, just like a coffin shoved in the corner.

[00:08:52.250] - Speaker 2
But I would see everybody come down the stairs, and it would be this parade of you, Chris Rock, Mariah Prince, Jay-Z, whoever. I would play that shit. I would play Rufus and Shaka Khan and AC/DC. And so Dom came up to me one night, and he had this amazing, very scratchy voice, and he was like, Yo, I got this girl, shouting over the music. I got this white chick, and I don't know what she's supposed to sound like, the album, but I wanted to sound like one of your DJ sets. Epmd, Biggie, AC/DC, Rufus & Shaka Khan. I was like, Okay. So that was literally how I got it. I I got most of my early stuff, like a little De la Soul remix here or whatever, because I was the DJ in the cool clubs, and maybe an A&R guy wanted to get on the list or whatever. So he would be like, Hey, I'll give you this De La Soul remix. But in Dom's case, I got the Nika Costa gig because of the way that I DJ.

[00:09:52.400] - Speaker 1
Tell me about going to Electric Lady for the first time working on Nika's album. You're not familiar with the equipment. Tell me about the experience. What was going on in your head? How long did it take to feel comfortable? High points and low points.

[00:10:08.420] - Speaker 2
I really remember really, really vividly coming down the stairs for the first time. It might be still the same legendary purple carpet that's there, but it hadn't been vacuumed in a while. There was a really famous studio manager, Mary, who had been there since the '80s, and I came down, and I remember this coming down off eighth Street, coming down these stairs, the cat, fucking Black cat, runs right in front of you. I hear this lady go, Oh, don't worry. That's Jimmy. Hi, I'm Mary. Nice to meet you. I'm like, I'm Mark. Yeah, I'm here at Studio A or something. She leads me into the room. I just remember, it's fucking double doors open and all that analog gear and everything. When there's that much equipment in a room, too, there's a hum. You go in and you can feel the hum and the warmth of it. I'd been in studios like that, probably a bunch with my stepdad, when I was 9 or 10, he was in Foreigner making records when he was in there. I remember feeling very both excited and native. I keep using that word. I've never used it before, but very at home in a place like that.

[00:11:28.940] - Speaker 2
Yes, you're right. I I was very overwhelmed. Luckily, I co-produced Nika's album with her husband, Justin, who was older than me, and he was a pretty well-established producer from Australia where he was from, so he knew all the analog gear. But I also remember feeling intimidated. I remember he was running around adjusting microphones over snares and all this shit and mic prees. We had made all the demos up to then on my Maki track where I'm the Lord of this domain. I at least know how everything works. All of a sudden, I felt… They didn't sideline me, but I felt sidelined. I was like, Okay, I don't really know how to do anything here. I was in there recording Quest Love, James Poey, all these people. I remember thinking, I feel a little like the triangle player in an orchestra. Somehow, I'm here, but I don't know how mandatory I am. There's something about it like, yeah, I would chime in when there was a great take and that was it. One thing I really remember and I wrote about in the book because the book ends with the Nika record pretty much. But Questlove went out on a Tuesday because that's when albums used to come out.

[00:12:48.440] - Speaker 2
He went to Disco-rama on eighth Street, and he came back with a bunch of CDs, and he had the new Fiona Apple album, When the Pawn, and he put it in. The first shit just blew us away in that crazy production at John Bryant with chamberlains, and the drums were so heavy and her vocals were incredible. We were just stunned into silence. Here we are in the fucking second day. We haven't even recorded a fucking kick drum yet. We were just left so depressed. We just all had to file out the room and couldn't come back to work for an hour. But then it started to go. They were taking the demos and the stuff that we had worked on and bringing it to But at the same time, I was a bit like, Oh, I love the fucked-upness of the loops and the stuff. Here we are replacing loops with incredible live drumming, but suddenly quite organic sounding. Then we found that middle ground anyway. But it was definitely both exciting and fucking intimidating.

[00:13:55.640] - Speaker 1
How different were the demos in terms of, were they all looped sampled? Were they no players?

[00:14:03.280] - Speaker 2
The demos, all the drums were loops and samples because that's all I knew. I collected breaks and I had my MPC, and then we played instruments on top of it. But then we had Quest Love who obviously knows how to play a break. It's incredible. It was to bring it to life in the fills, but it was at the time, Lauryn Hill, Miseducation was out, and it was just this benchmark of how to bring loops and these things together. That's what I was aiming for. At first, I didn't know. You're just hearing this, you're like, It's so live. What are we going to do? It was my first time at the rodeo. I didn't think like, Okay, well, afterwards, we can fucking layer it with the loops or whatever.

[00:14:49.040] - Speaker 1
Was it the first time you worked with really great musicians?

[00:14:52.320] - Speaker 2
Yes, I think so.

[00:14:54.320] - Speaker 1
What was that feeling of first time you got to be in the studio and watch Quest Love play?

[00:15:01.680] - Speaker 2
It was incredible. I was intimidated as fuck by him because back then, I was really the first time. I was a fan of the roots. When the first time you meet him as well, he uses his words sparingly. I think he had his special drum booth that was erected to make a really tight sound, this really closed-in thing. It was almost like, This is my force. Just don't fucking bother me. It was almost like him and Pino from working on D'Angelo's Voodoo, they had a psychic... They would go to field changes. At one point, we had this slow mid-tempo Rocky Ballet, and they just went to this double-time drum and bass thing. As soon as Questlove started to do it, Pino followed him, and I was like, This is incredible. But at the same time, it made me feel less important or needed because my whole thing was like, Oh, I just know how to run an MPC. That's my job.

[00:16:06.140] - Speaker 1
When you were in bands before becoming a DJ, what were the New York bands that were going on at the time? Who would have been the people that you would have gone out to see and maybe hoped to go on tour with?

[00:16:18.660] - Speaker 2
We loved... Because the band was a mixture of Black and White kids, and we loved 247 Spies, Living Color, Follow For Now, all that Black Coalition stuff. So we loved those bands. We played at wetlands quite a bit. So we dug the jam bands too, like Spin Doctors and Blues Traveler and some of those other bands because they had very tight rhythm sections. And then we loved the roots. That came a little later, actually. And I think it was the goats as well because we would bring rappers on stage. We were just trying to figure it all out. The Black Crowes, Lenny, because that had this 70 swagger to it. That first Black Crowes record was a big influence on a lot of the band. Then our drummer, Listen to Morrissey. I was starting to love all this The brand new heavies and Jamiracoy and all this English acid jazz funk stuff because it was very similar to the stuff that hip hop sampled. There were these live bands playing old funk and soul. Morris Bernstein, who's this guy who started Giant Step. I used to sneak into the parties. I was 15 or 16, and I ran up on him at one of his parties, and I was like, Hey, you should let my band play.

[00:17:42.780] - Speaker 2
My band had the worst name. They were called the Whole Earth Mommas. I ran up to Maurice. His name's Maurice, but English people, of course, have to pronounce everything differently. Maurice. I said, You should let us play. He's like, What's your band again? Mother Earth, Garden Bistro or something. I was like, Hold it, Mom. I was like, You should put us on the bill. And he was like, Sorry, the bill's full. They had like Edo G and Pal Joey and Arrested Development, all these incredible bands. And I was like, What if I get my friend Sean to play? And I didn't even know where it came from. I was so fucking... I was almost blown away by my own fucking guile. And he said, Sean who? And I said, Sean Lennon, because Sean was my best and I basically sold him out. I had an idea. I was like, Maybe he'll help us get the gig in here. Maurice was like, All right, if you get him, I'll let you on the bill. Then I had to go to Sean, fucking tell him. Obviously, it's not, I sold you out to get this gig. I was like, Hey, my band got this great gig.

[00:18:50.280] - Speaker 2
You want to come jam with us? I think he knew something was off and whatever, but we got the gig. I think Maurice used the thing to get MTV down, MTV News to come down. Sean hadn't made his records yet. He was still John Lennon's son, everybody wanted to cover everything that he did. So that was probably our biggest gig. And then we were so not ready for that. Stage that it just was our last gig, too. So watch what you lag yourself into.

[00:19:22.420] - Speaker 1
How did the idea for the book come?

[00:19:26.200] - Speaker 2
A couple of things had it percolating in my mind, but there was really one catalyst. One of my best friends and DJ partners of the past 20 or 25 years passed away four years ago. His name was Blue Gems. They were throwing a party at this club in New York called La Ban, where he used to DJ all the time. He was basically the mascot spirit of the place. Even though he had already passed, they wanted to throw a party on his birthday. They asked me to DJ. It was just as COVID as any people were starting to party again. It felt It felt like it was just going to be a lovely thing. I was sitting in my little library where I have all my records at home, just looking around at all these records because I hadn't DJed with vinyl in 20 years, but I still kept my favorites. I'm just thinking about all these records, looking at them, and I see one spine. It's just a Kelly Green spine on a 12-inch. And just instantly, I'm like, Oh, yeah, I remember. That's Trends of Culture. I bought it at Rock and Soul in 1994.

[00:20:28.500] - Speaker 2
Just how visceral all the memories that came from just even looking at these objects. I don't want to make it sound like this book is some altruistic thing to remember all these fallen heroes because it's a lot of things. But a lot of people were dying, and I just started to think, Man, I want to get some of these stories down about some of these people that I love in this time before they go out of my brain. God knows I drank enough and partied and did drugs and my brain's cloudy enough. These kids kept coming up to me, too. A young kid would be like, Yo, you were in New York in the '90s. That must have been crazy. I had fun in the '90s, but we were thinking about the '80s. We were thinking about the Roxy and Dan Satiria. Every era has the era before it. It romanticizes. But enough kids had come up that I was like, Yeah, there was something great about it. New York was this incredible spot as far as what was being made here. It was Biggie, it was Wu-Tang, it was Jay, it was LL, it was Tribe, and they were in the clubs as well.

[00:21:34.760] - Speaker 2
Then you had Timberland, and Missy, and Alia, and Pharrell, and Chad, and even the most exciting people of everywhere were coming to New York to make records, and I would see them in the club all the time. I was DJing for them. I started to think that far more famous DJs than me have written books, but no one's really written the book that just talks about what it's like to be a gigging DJ, not a superstar DJ, but that shit when you're just going to work four or five nights a week, playing in bars and clubs and dealing with regular people. I don't want to over-dramatize it, the emotional highs and lows. But there are these things that are baked into it. You're the most solitary figure in the most action-packed surroundings. I wanted to talk about all that shit. I decided to put this book in the '90s because I just like the idea of having a very finite window. I'm sure there are some people who are just like, Wait, what? You wrote a book and there's no Amy. What sense does that make? I picked a period before I was really actually known or known outside of a very small scene in New York, but I wanted to keep it in that.

[00:22:51.510] - Speaker 2
And so it starts with clubbing in New York, going to raves as a kid, seeing a DJ for the first time live, and it ends with me walking around Soho with my daughter, strapped me in a baby beyond seeing all these clubs, buildings that are no longer.

[00:23:06.000] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like the book documents your experience in the '90s, or is it the experience of clubs in the '90s?

[00:23:16.420] - Speaker 2
That's a very good and the key question. I think that it is a memoir. It is a mini memoir. It's very much my experience emotionally, but at the same time, I love a great oral history, and Lizzy Goodman's Meet Me in the Bathroom and Can't Stop, Won't Stop, all these great hip hop oral histories. I knew I wasn't doing that, but I did interview, I think I lost count, 150, maybe 200 people because I wanted to paint as much of the scene if you're reading this book that you still could get a sense of the '90s. One night that I I always remember was this party called Sweet Thing on a Tuesday that I did. The first night Biggie came, it was obviously a fucking seismic event. Even the way that the club was shaped, this weird angle in corners, I barely saw him. I could feel the energy like, Holy shit, Biggie said, and the crowd, ripple. You knew that something was going on. But I remember at the end of the night, Big Frank, whose party it was, was security, a promoter, all of it, telling me, Biggie rolling up with 50 dudes from Brooklyn.

[00:24:39.660] - Speaker 2
Some of them had guns, swords, sending them all back to the car and Frank telling Biggie like, Yo, you know I can't let 50 dudes in right now. And Biggie just being like, Don't worry, I'll stand here until each one gets in. You just let them in how you can. You balance them with the girls, and then I'll come in when it's all done. Just standing there, just hands over a knot of cash, a wad this thick, and just giving a bill each time someone comes in. Those stories were like, I wanted to make sure because it's not a memory that I remember viscerally. I feel like it's probably not going to translate that great on the page, but there were also amazing stories and anecdotes that I wanted to share and have in the book. It's very much a snapshot of a very particular scene. It doesn't speak for much north of 14th Street either. It's this little downtown hip hop scene, this thing that was Stretcher Armstrong and very much came out of the ethos of what you built. It had this downtown thing, and what was cool about it. It had that mixture of hip hop heads, fans, dancers, skateboard kids, artists, models, whatever.

[00:25:55.800] - Speaker 2
It was just that weird downtown cocktail of what that would have made the Roxy great or something.

[00:26:03.020] - Speaker 1
What do you think makes a club great?

[00:26:07.040] - Speaker 2
The best one, some of them were just a fucking corridor with two speakers. The crowd is what makes the club great. I think the crowd and the DJ. But of course, there were incredible places like Tunnel and Lime Light and Roxy and these places that were made to be these wild fun houses. But for me, my favorite places were always... 50% of them were basements. I tried to get into that in the book. I'm like, Why was it the basement? Is there something like going underground where you're getting a little closer to Satan's real estate. Are you just aware we're going down here being summoned for a Dianaiian rite? And it's also that thing, we're down here now, where We've all come to this place. We might as well be down here because it's going to take a little longer to get out. I don't know what the fuck it is.

[00:27:07.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah. There is something about basements feeling like you could get trapped really easily.

[00:27:12.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah. You could get exactly You could get trapped. There was this one club. I don't know if you ever went. David Lynch has this club. I don't know if it's still there. I had this club that he designed called Silencio. It was in Paris. You had to go so far down to get into this club, you just couldn't help but think like, Jesus, what if there's a fucking fire or something? It felt like you were descending four floors underground. But once you were down there, it got naughty in there because it was just like, Wow, we're down here.

[00:27:44.820] - Speaker 1
How does the energy of a club change over the course of the night?

[00:27:50.800] - Speaker 2
I wouldn't say, I don't know if it's what I miss, but what made me good back then, you would play six hours. You would really play 10: 00 to 4: 00, maybe 11: 00 to 4, and you were there to build the whole night. There was this New York regimen back in the day. It's certainly different now, but you would play classic some funk and soul, and then that would move into some more up-tempo disco and maybe some break beats if there were break dances out on the floor. Then you would go to old-school hip hop, Slick Rick, EPMD. Somehow at 12: 31, you would really try and save the new hip hop as long as you can, keeping them at the gate. See how long you could really tease the crowd before you suddenly dropped Biggie, DMXJ, whatever it was. Then you would play one to two new hip hop, then dance hall, then some new hip hop, some old school, and then maybe a little bit of house or some classic old school dance shit till the end. It was amazing to I get to architect that. Part of what happened later when you, whether you become a big DJ or whatever it is, you're just going on these festivals at this peak hour and you're going to play an hour set.

[00:29:13.000] - Speaker 2
So I missed all that feeling of building the night. There's a great DJ in New York who's from my era, but I talk about him in the book a little. His name is Elie Escobar because he was a bit of an unsung hero for the first 25 years of his career. And then suddenly in the last 5, 10 years, has just become this New York nightlife icon. But he'll still play that six-hour set because he loves that thing of playing the whole night. Actually, a friend of mine who read the book was like, Hey, man. Yeah, no, I dig the book. It just really sounds like you just miss playing vinyl again. That was his takeaway from the book. He's somebody who's always come to me with a good creative idea and just said it like it's gospel. I think you need to just play vinyl now till the end of the year. I remember thinking like, That sounds like such a pain in the ass, but also maybe incredible. So that's what I've been doing. I've just been playing vinyl again. And it's certainly about 2007. After 2007, the selections get a little slim, but I just love it.

[00:30:26.400] - Speaker 2
And I'm going back and I'm playing five, six hour sets again. Amazing. There's all this '90s and 2000s hip hop that when I'm playing off my computer drive or USBs, even though I'm playing with turntables, they become almost not meaningless because they're still great songs, but it's one of 20,000 songs on a hard drive, three megabytes. It's click and drag, and it's there.

[00:30:57.920] - Speaker 1
If you know you're only going to be playing vinyl, would you go to the extreme of having vinyl pressed for things you want to play that vinyl doesn't exist for?

[00:31:10.080] - Speaker 2
I think I would, actually. I think that you can press 45s. There's this DJ, this Japanese DJ, who I watch on Instagram because he just has these incredible things where he's just cutting 45s, and it's just so exciting. His body language is so swinging and just so… I always wish I had that body language as a DJ, gregarious and inviting. I've always just been a bit just sweating, going through it, throwing records every which way. But he has all this new shit. I know watching him, I'm like, Oh, there must be a way. I think that there's an affordable 45 pressing machine that you can have in your crib, maybe. But yeah, there would certainly be things. I remember the first time I ever made a record that I pressed up on acetate was the Nika Costa record, Like a Feather, because it was the first time I had ever made anything that I deemed worthy to play in the club. I was like, Wow, let's see. I remember going to Sterling and just watching the lath for the first time come down. Obviously, technically, it's just making microscopic wiggles that amplitudes and volumes and whatever.

[00:32:26.960] - Speaker 2
But I was like, this shit is scoping accepting music. This is incredible. I remember playing it for the first time, and then obviously, acetates, you can only play them five or six times. They wear down. You can't really back cue them a lot because you'll wear out the groove. I remember one of the main promotion guys from Badboy Records, his name was Hen Rock. I remember him one time coming also to that same Tuesday night party that Biggie came to and bringing me an acetate of Biggie hypnotized and saying, I got the new Biggie joint. I can't give it to you. I got to take it to flex, but you could play it right now. I just remember being like, Holy shit. I don't even know if I had heard it yet. It was so crazy. I think there was this era where the first time you would ever hear a song was in the club amongst because a DJ had it or whatever. I remember putting it on and just handling it like a mingvas or some shit and throwing it on. And just release on beat whatever song I was playing it out of.

[00:33:34.620] - Speaker 2
Just because that song just came in so heavy, too, that with the kick drum and Biggie's fucking wheeze. The whole club, it was just one of those moments. I remember there's five or six songs from that era. I remember dropping for the first time or dropping in a certain way and feeling molecules shift in the club. There's something molecular heat energy energy that would just change. So yeah, those acetates were very special. I also remember walking past a Brownstone in Chelsea one time, and somebody had left all these original pressing, first pressing acetate outside that they must have not wanted anymore. It was all from the first brand Nubian album. I remember meeting Dante Ross one time, much later, and was like, Did you ever live on 21st Street? I just had an inkling they were his that he left out in the street. He was like, Yeah. But I like the way that playing vinyl only, it's just been a nice hard reset. I miss some of the creativity of what you can do with Serata, the way you can just make an acapella with a click of the thing and do mixes and use the bass line from a Jackson 5 song over a drum beat from whatever.

[00:34:52.800] - Speaker 2
But I just needed this hard reset at this moment, and it's been a lot of fun.

[00:34:58.560] - Speaker 1
Would you say it makes your DJ Is that very different?

[00:35:03.100] - Speaker 2
Yes. I noticed that younger kids are just watching because I'm not doing some DJ scratch crazy routine, but just cutting records, bringing them in on beat, taking them off, and maybe speed mixing, eight bars of this record into this one. They're just dumb struck. They just haven't seen it before. This is one of the things I think has gotten crazy about DJing, with DJs being huge headliners Like, DJs are not essentially performers, like pushing a series of buttons. Listen, Steve Aoki, there's people that are really good at it and it will bring this showmanship. But most of us, that's why there's 200 grand of LED lights and whatever the fuck else on stage and confetti canons. But there is something with vinyl that's like at least a little something to watch. The hands are doing something. There's a grace and a performance in it. Then the other thing was, I have to think so much before the gig about what I can bring tonight because I can't just show up with a laptop with the entire history of recorded music. Maybe 300 records if I really want to fucking do my back in that night.

[00:36:16.300] - Speaker 2
I'm carrying all these crates, so I have to think about what the crowd's going to be and what do I want this record and going through a record. I was psychically bonded with this crowd before they've even got there. It might be a totally different crowd that shows up than I'm imagined in my head. But I have a little bit of an idea and I'm picturing that dance for and seeing what that might be. I'm already in some flow. I've already thought about the record. Listen, doing that the past six months, it's so fucking crazy. All our schedules are full enough as it is. I'm like, not only do I have the DJ gig now, but I have to fucking carve out an hour and a half before the gig to get my records together. But it does make a difference, and there's something about it. It's like the warm up. Also, to be honest, that was the time I was probably the best DJ. I have more knowledge of music now. In the '90s, when I was playing five nights a week, I knew my crowds. There's probably something for me that's a little bit...

[00:37:23.480] - Speaker 2
I'm performing and playing the record and doing it in the same way when I was at my best. So I feel a little invincible, right?

[00:37:34.380] - Speaker 1
How different is the audience today than it was in the '90s?

[00:37:38.860] - Speaker 2
The crowds are pretty much completely different. I'm playing for 93% different crowd. There's some old heads that come out, and occasionally I'll play a party where it's a little bit of an old-school crowd like that. But when I haven't played in a while, I have a few younger DJs that are dope that I text like, Hey, what's popping? What's the new shit? And these kids are I was just like, Man, we're just playing Year and AM's 2000 set. I have that going on a little bit in my production right now because I noticed that music is going back to this thing and kids are falling in love with those same drum sounds that we were doing in the 2000s, the old-school '60s breakbeat sound and all that. Maybe it never went away, but I noticed it's really back and kids are like, Yeah, no, do that shit. It's not that I'm Tom York or Square Push where I'm so entirely progressive that I will never repeat myself. But in my head, I'm like, Really? But I did that. I remember once doing a record with Duran Duran, who I really loved. They were one of my first favorite groups as a kid and still made great records.

[00:38:48.220] - Speaker 2
But I remember going in the studio with them, maybe it was 15 years ago, and I was like, Can we get some of that? The Rio, the magic of Rio, the sequences, They did it, 16th notes, disco hats, tough drums, nasty guitars, and just great songs, funky bass lines, that thing. They were like, But we did that. I remember thinking, Yes, but it was this moment that the killers had just broken and Franz Ferdinand, and all these English bands, the Kaiser Sheets. I was like, But all the coolest shit is just taking a lot of what you did. This is the cool shit right now. But I do remember them because they like to stay moving I'm bored. Now when I'm in the studio with younger artists, you're like, No, that shit was dope. How you did that back then. It's still this push and pull. I'm not wanting to repeat myself. I guess the other thing is it's interesting to me when a 23-year-old reinvents it or takes some of the thing or some of those same concepts or ideals of what we were doing back then and puts it through their lens. When it's strictly through my lens, that's when it just becomes recycling.

[00:40:05.620] - Speaker 2
With the DJing, when the kids are like, No, we're just playing the 2000s set that you're doing. I'm like, Oh, it's nice to hear because I love that music and it's fun to play. But it's super cool when I watch a young 23-year-old DJ playing Nory or whatever else it is. When I'm doing it, do I just look like that old guy who's just falling back on this same shit?

[00:40:30.000] - Speaker 1
Do you record all of your DJ sets?

[00:40:32.820] - Speaker 2
I actually never record any of them. Because I'm not on the mic, the mic is like when you hear those great old DJ set recordings and someone's on the mic and you can hear the crowd because the bleed from the mic. It seems to me it's so ephemeral. There's something so in the moment about it. I played a set for A track recently, and he recorded it. Also, the other thing is when you're fucking playing in the crowd, I try to be as precise as possible, but you're in the moment and it's with the crowd and you might be dropping a record not offbeat, but maybe not in the most… The mix wouldn't be as exact as if you were just sitting in the studio making a fucking blend tape. It's almost like, I don't want to hear it back. But he did record it because it was for the fool's gold, his label's anniversary, and I heard it back and I was like, Oh, that's actually pretty good. I don't really ever need to hear them again.

[00:41:35.540] - Speaker 1
How long did it take you to put the book together?

[00:41:38.560] - Speaker 2
It took me probably... From start to finish, it was about three years. I had to stop. There were music projects here and there, and we did the score and the music for the Barbie film, which probably took over nine months, maybe a year of my life. But I read Stephen King on writing. I never studied writing in school, so I read Stephen King's on writing and Mary Carr's The Art of Memoir. I just love Stephen King's, how austere his rules were, like lock yourself in a fucking basement and no windows and five hours a day and these things. For the first year, I was in the basement of my place in New York until I realized, Wait, this is actually a health hazard. Maybe I should just seal the windows off somewhere else because it's just a damp fucking New York basement with water damage everywhere. But I would try and write 8: 00 to 1: 00 or 8: 00 to 2: 00 and then take a break and then do whatever music stuff that I was working on. But it really did take over. There was a time, certainly in the second year of it, where I was so turning down studio work and working on records to really focus on this.

[00:43:00.460] - Speaker 2
I was aware that something was pulling me to this, and there was a reason I needed to do it. But at the same time, I was like, I had no idea if it was good, terrible. What the fuck? I'm like, Now I'm in year two. Is this now I'm in year two? Is this a total waste? I was doing it at that point. I was so deep into it. Then at the very end, I handed in the book to my editor, January of this year. He was like, Great. That my editor at the publishing house Colin, who was a great editor and really helped me out a lot along the way. I think in some ways, he had seen the writing go from maybe being a four to a seven and a half, was just so happy we were out the woods. But there was something that I just knew it wasn't done. I just was like, I don't feel like breaking out the champagne, this doesn't feel done to me. That was already almost three years in. I showed it to my wife's cousin, He was a really incredible writer named Abe Streep. He wrote a book about a Native American basketball team from Montana.

[00:44:06.860] - Speaker 2
It's just an incredible book and writes for the New Yorker, all this shit anyway. He's around my age. He loves that era of hip hop, and he said that he would read it. I was like, Thanks so much. He was like, I called him up and the first thing he said was, So there's a permanence to books. I was like, Oh, God, here we go. He was trying to tell me, This thing's going to be around forever. I think you could spend a little time and make it better. So he came on and really helped me as an editor for a little while. And then he passed me to his editor, The New Yorker. In the last three months of the book, I just spent 18-hour a day, self-imposed writing boot camp. And what was cool about having her is she made me put the stuff that you would expect from a New Yorker angle. Don't just say, All Peter Gation's clubs closed. Tell me how Giuliani's fucking policies and his war on club land, how did that thing? We can't just be suddenly at Friday Nights at Life and it's bottle service. Let me know why the climates of New York clubs changed and why it went from this pretty cool, egalitarian place where everyone's hanging, there's no VIP rooms.

[00:45:19.990] - Speaker 2
And suddenly we're at this thing where it's this total exclusive hierarchy of where people sit has become the most important thing. So I'm really grateful that that last couple months brought the thing to the book. Listen, the book's not perfect. It's something that I need to get out for whatever reason, and I wanted to tell a story of this time. But where it got to because of that last intense three months, I can't imagine if the old book came out.

[00:45:50.440] - Speaker 1
How has your relationship to that time period changed from working on the book?

[00:45:58.300] - Speaker 2
I don't know if it's If it's my midlife crisis, but it's funny. Carrying these 100-pound crates of gig bags, one in each hand to these gigs, lumbering upstairs again from basement clubs. Actually, two of my good friends from that era have been helping carry the records. There's definitely something about it. It's just like we're literally just repeating 30 years. You could take a snapshot. We look a little older, but this looks like what we were doing 30 years ago, and there's something about it that's both sweet and like, okay, are we just trying to relive some glory part of our youth? But I've been working on a record at the same time to go with this book. The record, I don't want to be retro. I don't want it to sound like '90s stuff. But it has touches and some samples and some flips of things from that era. Honestly, some Most of the things that I'm flipping, most kids today will have never heard anyway. It is, hopefully, something fresh. I think the club and the DJing is informing the music in a nice way that's just like, I want the music to at least have the energy, the way it moves.

[00:47:19.980] - Speaker 2
I don't want to fall back on any of my go-to easy drum patterns that I know work or what I've been doing the last 20 years. I want this shit to move in the way the music of that time that I loved it. My ears are fucking battered. Holy shit. I forgot. I think you just regenerate so much better, your cells and all that stuff when you're that age. So now the pounding of those booth monitors for three, four hours is no joke. I've had to start wearing molds, but even that only really takes 10, 20 debes off. It's your skull that's part of what the tinnitus is. It's crazy. The past 20 years, I've been rocking up to a place and playing my little fucking hour set. I'm the headliner, but this is back to four or five hours of this pounding thing. And it's like, yeah, I've had to be really careful. That's also been a wake-up call, turning the monitors down, wearing the ear plugs, because my livelihood is now studio, so I I can't really just...

[00:48:31.820] - Speaker 1
It sounds like these five-hour sets are putting you closer in touch with the spirit of music than the connection you've had over the last, I don't know, 15 years.

[00:48:46.820] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:48:47.420] - Speaker 1
Has to.

[00:48:48.820] - Speaker 2
It does. There's all these other records. If I'm DJing somewhere, I play my '90s segment of the set or 2000s. It's this speed mix of 20 songs, Snoop, Dre, DMX, whatever, fucking 20 minutes. When I'm looking at 200 of those records, 200 records of the '90s and the 2000s, suddenly it's like, Oh, how the hell did I forget about Got It Twisted by Mob Deep and Fucking Soul's of Mischief, 93 till Infinity. It's like all these records that I've forgotten. The other The night I played at this roadside bar, Fried Chicken Restaurant Upstate in Upstate, New York, where I have a place. A friend of mine who threw Soul Kitchen with Franky, he lives Upstate, and he opened this cool fried chicken restaurant in this Twin Peaks-y-looking diner. So I was up there, and he just has two turntables, and they have disco nights there. So I was like, Yeah, let me play. So I went, and my opening song was, I think was Papa Don't Take No Mess by James Brown, into Golden Years by Bowie. And just that feeling of golden years, I think I had on a '45 because I just found it that day.

[00:50:10.560] - Speaker 2
And holding so delicately onto this '45, it's like spinning with the middle and the slip mat spinning underneath it and you're just cuing it exactly so you can drop it on beat because we all know 45s are a little harder to handle. It's just much more exciting. Like you said, the spirit of music, the breadth of music is much wider of what I'm playing. I'm playing music that, honestly, I like a lot more than probably some of the shit I've been playing for a little while. Then what's also funny is to see every generation of clubgoers has its own recurrent throwbacks. A song that wasn't even big to us when we were DJing the '90s and 2000s is now cool unironically for this generation's throwback. There's things that, no offense, I'm not going to play Return of the Mac. It's just not something I'm going to play. But the Ramones Blitz Kriegpop is a huge record for a hip hop party going downtown crowd. I'm Still Standing by Elton John, which is that. That's an interesting one to me because also the beat is like… It's not something… It's like an awkward way to dance.

[00:51:30.000] - Speaker 2
It's like, yeah, what else is big? Everybody wants to rule the world. I feel like these are like Stranger Things records, almost. Like Loveful by the Cardigans. So it's like fun tracking these ones down on vinyl, occasionally playing them, trying them out, and sometimes just be like, No, that's okay.

[00:51:49.780] - Speaker 1
How does disco fit into the picture?

[00:51:53.260] - Speaker 2
Disco was Michael Jackson, early prints, like disco prints, Sheryl Linn, Got to be real. These were all some of the cooler records and South Soul Orchestra. Those were all parts of the New York canon when I started DJing. Everybody knew it. But it's funny to think when I started DJing in '92, '93, Michael Jackson's Don't Stop To Get Enough was, what, 15 years old? There are Drake records that are older than 15 years old now to play. It's wild that that was really throwbacky to play a Michael Jackson song. Also, the thing about New York clubs is, especially in the hip hop clubs, it was a little more, not snooty, but there was an attitude. You're not going to hear September by Earth, Wind & Fire. You might hear a Brazilian rhyme song. You're not going to hear Michael Jackson, Don't Stop till You Get Enough. These songs are wedding songs or whatever you want to call them. Now I noticed, especially with the DJ Elie Escobar that I was talking, kids actually really want to go out and hear songs they've never heard before, which is like that blows my mind. Also, I find incredibly scary because I'm like, well, wait, what does that mean?

[00:53:09.680] - Speaker 2
Does that mean not to play any of the shit they used to play? Is it gauche or corny to play? I'm not talking about wedding tunes, but even a disco song. When I played the chicken restaurant, for lack of a better word, Upstate, I think it was maybe fit 300 people, and there were like of people partying outside because they were piping the music outside. The age was 18 to 60. That's another thing. Now I have people who like my music that are their 40s and 50s, and they might be bringing their kids. You're trying to find this balance. The thing that I talk about in the book, too, is that as a DJ, the other thing that's definitely changed for how I play is people come out and they expect to hear records that I made. Of course they do. They're going to see Mark Ronson. They're like, Okay, we're going to hear Valerie. We're going to hear Uptown Funk. We're going to hear whatever it is. But for me, that almost feels like cheating or something. If I'm playing and I don't have them enough, I know I could throw on one of my records.

[00:54:20.330] - Speaker 2
And those records are 10, 15 years old. I talk about this in the book. It's like when I play Uptown Funk, the crowd goes crazy. Bruno Mars is not standing next to me in the booth performing the song. I think it's amazing. It's like there's something psychological that happens in our brain. Why do people get more excited? Well, we know why. They're excited because they're dancing in front of the person who made it and they're showing their appreciation. I'm beyond grateful for all of it. I'm not paying lip service. I'm so lucky that anybody gives a shit is coming. But it always fascinates me that the the next DJ could literally get on and play Uptown Funk once I've left, and everyone will clear the dance floor. It's like there's all these bizarre things that happen in this psychic bond between the DJ and the crowd.

[00:55:13.260] - Speaker 1
Is the New York club seeing the same as it's always been?

[00:55:17.560] - Speaker 2
No. And it's changed so much that I could probably answer about 25% of this question. There's some shit in Manhattan, but really all the fun shit is in Brooklyn, for sure. The clubs. Then There's the knockdown center, which is out in Queens. There's places to party. The New York shit is... New York is always going to have its little spots, and it's going to have a vibe. But it's like, once a lot of cool people and artists, so many people were priced out of New York. Of course, the cool parties were as well. And there's no huge super clubs, really, to draw people in here. Most of that shit is in Brooklyn. So it's been getting back out. There's also It's been about hooking into the right scenes and making sure. I played a club in New York last week, and it was corny because it was just like, that's who goes out in New York. It was like, oh, man, I played the same set last week in Brooklyn, and it was incredible. So it's also been about finding the right people to make sure I'm hopping on the right gigs.

[00:56:24.400] - Speaker 1
Is the scene in Brooklyn as good as the scene in New in the '90s, or are they still different?

[00:56:32.940] - Speaker 2
I think it's good. I think it feels very vibrant and alive. I think there will always be something special about The '80s is incredible because the '80s was when it was very first happening. It was literally the Roxy and Uptown and downtown meeting each other for the first time. I mean, you were an architect of so much of why that was going on. Then the '90s was the last era before bottle service, VIP booths, and camera phones. I think that a lot of it had to do with people were just parting. People were parting with the absence of surveillance. It was this feeling. Then also people wanted to stay in rooms because you weren't getting FOMO because you could see another party happening down the street or just text your friend, Come over here. Then Even though, listen, smoking is bad for you. We all know that. But the smoking ban even changed something, too, because you have people keep going out to have a cigarette. Or there was something a little cool about the clubs, just this layer of smoke. I remember going to the first live shows after the smoking ban, too, to see bands.

[00:57:49.640] - Speaker 2
It was weird not having that protective gauze of weird fucking chip between you and the state. You could just see right through to the band. It was just different.

[00:58:01.980] - Speaker 1
What's your favorite club in the world?

[00:58:06.000] - Speaker 2
There was a club night in London at this club called the Notting Hill Arts Club, another basement, very special. These two English DJs, Seb Chew and Leo Greens laid through it. And early in the night, they would have a little showcase for a new band or whoever was launching. And then 11: 00 PM, it would turn into the club. Because they just became known as the spot to play when you first came to London, it was like, Lupe Fiasco, Lily Allen, Kanye, Bruno, Leroux. The list is just like It was endless. Everybody played their first UK showcase there because everyone knew that was the spot. Then the party was just insane. I remember going and playing there my first time. Actually, I remember someone saying, Oh, you got to come down here. The DJ Seb is like, he's like the London Mark Ronson. So of course, I'm like, I'll go down, I'll show them. As much as I ever get into that mode. And I go down and I play my New York set at the time that I just had clockwork and quick mixes and clever fucking blends and wordplay and all this shit.

[00:59:18.880] - Speaker 2
And the crowd was like, oh. And then Seb just got on. And the first thing he played was some UK garage or drum and bass record that just like, they were banging the fucking wall. He didn't do it to show me up either. It was just like, cool. That was a great set. You played all the hip hop, so let me just play some UK shit. It was such an eye opener. There are entire other genres of essentially Black music that will bring a fucking house down that I know nothing about. I loved playing there. I started to go back there and play a lot when my first record came out. The song Uwe with Ghostface and Nate Dogg did well in England and didn't do much here, but it kept my buzz. I was going over there to play parties, and I just loved it. Actually, it inspired me to come back because that was at the time where, 2003, New York had I was just so turned off New York and the bottle service and everything that it had become. I came back and I told Q-Tip, I was like, Yo, Tip, the party I just played in London, you're playing shit that they love and you're playing like, OC, Times Up and underground records, and people are just going off like, Let's just do that shit here and just see.

[01:00:35.260] - Speaker 2
Of course, you're doing something with Q-Tip. People are going to come down and be excited about it. But we found a basement, this basement club called Table 50 on Blicer Street. Actually, my friend Blue Gems, who the book is dedicated to, who passed, he found it. And he was always the person dragging me to some fucking basement being like, Yo, we got to do a party here. It's going to be the best shit ever. And he was usually right. We go into a basement, a dingy basement at 4: 00 in the afternoon, and he would just have some vision. And it was. And it was this amazing party that did breathe some life back into both my love for DJing and down town at that moment. And Busta, Most Def, and people would just come and grab the mic and shit and get on over it while me and Tip were DJing. So that party, back to your question, though, in London, Notting Hill Arts Club, was a really special place. And it ended, I think, after about 10 years because a lot of hip hop parties, there was some violence in there. But I remember for the 10th anniversary party, I surprised them.

[01:01:40.560] - Speaker 2
Nas was in town, and I was like, I want to give these guys the best, and this crowd, the best birthday present I can think of. So I managed to work it through and then Nas came and did a surprise set. And one of my favorite Nas songs ever is Made You Look. It's just such a hard fucking record. And I was Nas's DJ for one night. And there's just this moment on YouTube, and I used to spend many a late night fucking high watching that one, six seconds over and over. And Nas just goes, Yo, Mark, hit him with that murder. And I just dropped made you look. And the whole fucking place came down. And it was just like, yeah, I never stopped being a fan of the artist that I love. And I'm nearly 50 fucking years old. And being on stage, getting to play public service announcement with Jay or Nas. It will just send me right down to my 18-year-old, whatever it is.

[01:02:41.700] - Speaker 1
How would you say your taste in music has changed over the course of your life?

[01:02:47.440] - Speaker 2
I think COVID was a big thing of spending a lot of time at home. I started to listen to records at home, maybe for the fucking first time, except when I'm at home. I'm to records to quickly look for breaks or listen to what I'm going to spend that night. But actually to listen as a passive listener. I found a lot of '50s jazz, '40s, '50s, '60s jazz, Coltrane and Jerry Mulligan. Then I know it's so fucking... It's the cliché rom-com soundtrack, but Chet Baker. Just beauty, music with beauty and simplicity. Country music, a lot of classic '50s, '60s, '70s country music. My wife loved Willy Nelson, discovering just the beauty in those things. Then I feel like as I've gotten older, and I remember, now it makes sense. I saw it with all my favorite artists. I want to challenge myself tonally, quarterly, not because I want to be up my own ass and make complicated music. That's not my thing, but you're just looking to try new things harmonically. In that jazz and that playing of Bill Evans and those people, there's something in there. I noticed as I'm making music now, I'm trying to imbue the music that I'm making with that.

[01:04:16.540] - Speaker 2
But I also know that I'm aware you get to this thing that you complicate your music a lot and you're just, you're off. You're on that next phase of your career. I think there's something about me. I don't know if it's my fucking ego or my ambition. I'm like, okay, I'm not ready to go riding off into my prog fusion sunset yet. How do I do this and still do it with the records that I love? It's interesting. It's interesting how, we know this, all When you're a kid, you just see your favorite artist and you just go, Oh, they went weird. They started to make fucking grown up music or something like that. Now I understand it. Your taste kept evolving and you were trying out new shit. Yeah, no.

[01:04:59.580] - Speaker 1
He You said your early works were not well received in New York, but they were well received in the UK. What do you think it was about those records that worked in the UK?

[01:05:14.080] - Speaker 2
Well, the biggest one was this record with Ghostface and Nate Dogg, Uwe. And weirdly, that really rang off on the West Coast, Toronto, Hawaii. I don't know of what... Because I was about to say maybe it's sunny places, but obviously Toronto isn't. But I made a record with Wutang, with Ghostface. But it wasn't a hard record. It wasn't like a Wutang record. It had this bubbly, slightly disco with the Dennis coffee breakbeat thing to it. What was I really making? I was like, in my mind, if I'd really thought about the time, there wasn't an obvious Hot '97 record. I was just making some shit that appealed to the DJ side that wanted some hard drums, but still some fast shit that made people move. I also do think that growing up in England, where you would hear a song, an old-school reggae song like Uptown Top Ranking by Althia and Donna next to Duran Duran, next to Bill Withers, Lovely Day, next to maybe like a De La Soul record, there was much less separation of what would be played on the radio because Radio One and BBC, in England, just a little more eclectic.

[01:06:26.800] - Speaker 2
I always think about how Amy Winehouse and Adele, and they're essentially soul singers. But if they hadn't grown up in England with that slightly more English sensibility, you just mix a bunch of shit together because you love it, which seems very inherently what you should do everywhere, but it's not quite R&B, and things are a little bit more regimened here. I think that there's definitely something about the way I grew up in the UK that I hadn't acknowledged so much until Oh, that's why these people all like my shit over there.

[01:07:03.680] - Speaker 1
Can you think of a song that you loved when you were young that you still love? And can you think of a song that you loved when you were young? And now if you listen to it, you can't believe you ever liked it.

[01:07:15.620] - Speaker 2
My dad had really great taste. My stepdad was the one in Foreign, and my dad was just loved funk, soul, Grand Central Station, Parliament, Funkadelic, all this shit. So he loved early hip hop. So Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, The Message. He used to play that all the time. Me and my sisters would go to visit him in England once or twice a year because my parents split. My mom moved to New York, and we would dance, jumping down, up on his bed listening to the message. So obviously, that's a song that I still think is incredible to this day. I listened to a lot of hair metal when I was a kid because I played guitar in bands, and that was trendy. I went to a guitar camp to try and learn to be a shredder, and I fucking hated it, and I was not very good, not good enough to be a shredder. So there was a lot of bands like Slaughter, L. A. Guns, Enough's Enough. They had some good songs. I don't want to rip into any of them, but there was some stuff from that that probably if I had to, it's probably something I wouldn't listen to much today.

[01:08:31.400] - Speaker 2
And then what's so amazing is when you hear a song that you completely forgot about. There was that band King's X. They were like a three-piece, had a little bit of a rush, proggy thing. And I just heard a King's X song from that era. I think it was called Summerland. I was like, This is a gorgeous fucking song. Yeah, just how those songs give you this jolt. If they can get me for three three minutes through my fucking morning run. I'm so grateful for that. Three minutes where I've just forgot that I hate doing this and I'm fucking panting and about to fall over. I find like that happens more often with songs that I've forgotten about.

[01:09:15.820] - Speaker 1
Tell me about your listening habits. General listening, not related to work.

[01:09:21.820] - Speaker 2
General listening is now with my two and a half daughter. Most of my passive listening is what she's listening to. Our Our mutual friend, Richard Russell, gave me this great radio that's this little radio for kids. It's environmentally friendly. It's wooden and has these buttons and you can just program all her favorite songs into it. She's just there She loves her radio, and I got her one of those old... Here I am just putting all of my fucking baggage and shit on her. But this '80s Fisher Price turntable, the one that maybe has the Sesame Street big bird as the arm and her 45s. She has her own 45s she can put on. Yesterday, I try and get her... I'm not trying to give her my taste. I'm not even trying to make this look more attractive. I don't want her to become a DJ, any of this stuff, or if she finds it great. But it's more just like she seems to be drawn to it. She has her 45s and a bunch of Disney, Robin hood, whatever the fuck. But yesterday, she was just the Pretender's Brass in pocket, I'm special, because I must have put that in her pile, and she was just listening to it over and over again.

[01:10:38.030] - Speaker 2
It's just so cool that that's a record that she's picked out, that she's drawn to. Then she loves when we go to my record player and put something on, she knows that there's an extra... That's a level up of ceremony or whatever. She's like, Dada, go listen to Chitia Changes, Bowie. Go listen to Chit Chit Chit Changes by the fireplace, which is where my record player is. But just letting her find her own music. She happens to love Scenario by Tribe Call Quest and Shake It Off by Taylor Swift and Casey Musgrave, Slow Burn, and whatever she loves. She has her little records, and that's most of my passive listening right now is whatever she has on.

[01:11:25.300] - Speaker 1
Tell me the difference between curating music and having music curated for you?

[01:11:31.740] - Speaker 2
I know that part of what made me a better DJ, let's just say it, in the '90s was that I was going out every night to hear other DJs. I was playing four nights a week, and two, three of the other nights, I was going out to hear other DJs play, or they were DJs playing before me, and I was checking out their sets or the DJs after me. You have to go see other people play, I feel like. There's so many records, especially now, maybe even, that if you've heard them or maybe you listen to it on Apple or Spotify, you wouldn't even think. You might not think that much of it. You see it in a club with 300 people fucking going off and pounding the walls and shit. It's a totally different experience. Then there's also this other side of it. There's something, and I touch on in the book because it was such a thing back then in the '90s. There was a certain circle of DJs who were all in each other's sphere. It was Stretch, Mighty My, Riz, Max Glazer, Goldfinger. We all went to each other's sets on our nights off.

[01:12:35.100] - Speaker 2
Then we'd all hang in the booth because we really just all wanted to be asked to fucking get on. We didn't know how to really just fully be in a club and enjoy ourselves. The idea of being in this place and not having something to do with this fucking vibe was drove us crazy. We would just wait in the booth like record vultures until the other DJ had to take a piss and just be like, Yo, can you want to get on for a second? So the dichotomy of like, When I go to these other sets, but then only so much because then you're like, Fuck, well, now I want to get on. I want some of this glory or some of this energy.

[01:13:15.440] - Speaker 1
You talked about having the acetate for Biggie's new record brought to you and playing it for the first time and the feeling in the room. We think of hip hop as so much of a poetic, lyrical style. And in a club, the lyrics are not always so detectable, especially on a complicated rap record. So if something's not known and you're playing it for the first time, it's hard to even know.

[01:13:47.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I think this has even maybe been to my detriment as someone who makes music. I think because drums were my first instrument, and I always came from groove first, the beat has always been the first thing that I react to. I think it wasn't even until I really got into Bob Dylan was the first time I really appreciate it. I was like, Who cares what the cords are doing? The Story is the thing that's important. I feel like it's fairly obvious from your work that point of view and story is always the driver, and then there's always great music under it.

[01:14:26.000] - Speaker 1
For me, it's really the beat. It's always been the beat as well. Oh, is it?

[01:14:29.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah, Yeah. Really? Okay. Yeah. I mean, of course, for the early records, the beats were crazy, too. I feel like as a DJ, and I think that was something we used to talk about when they started to use the thing, Hot Record all the time. Hot Records, yes, but is it a good record Hot, right? Hot record makes you think the beat comes on, it's hot. It reminds you of something you heard before. Hot, hot. The difference between hot and good started to drive me a little bit crazy. But yes, for a song like Biggie Hypnotize, I think because rappers like Biggie, where the timbre of his voice was almost like as exciting, it was like the aphrodisiac in the club and that unmistakable wheeze, that with the beat, the way it dropped, boom, boom, oh, just came in. I think it was just like a meteor hitting the club. It was something... Biggie had so many hits at that moment. It was just before he passed. He was the king of New It was like there were this moment that you could hear Biggie's voice on anything, and it would probably have worked in the club, but that was especially special.

[01:15:39.320] - Speaker 2
It was like that era of that production. It was, for lack of a better word, jiggy. It had all those triangles and shakers. Some of it has aged better than others, but that beat just was heavy.

[01:15:55.360] - Speaker 1
How do you decide what to listen to on your morning run?

[01:15:59.120] - Speaker 2
It's so Different because I only started running recently. I always hated running. I had to run in high school because I was so bad at all the other sports because I came here from England when I was eight. I didn't know. Like, baseball, football, that shit had already been going on. I was bad at soccer, which everyone assumed that I would be good at soccer, at least. So I had to run cross country because I just didn't want to do PE. Running, It's in stamina, endurance, anybody could get through running. I hate it for most of my life. Then I really fucked up my knee four years ago. I went on a run for the first time in five years, fucked up my knee, and did something where I couldn't basically use it for a year or two. I thought that I was probably done with it. I didn't really care either because I wasn't a runner. Then when it came back after a good trainer got it back, I was almost so I was so thrilled to be able to use this thing that I hadn't cared about. I just suddenly like, I want to run now.

[01:17:06.940] - Speaker 2
It was just an interesting thing. Running, for me, is either Furious Guitars. A lot of that, for me, is like '90s and 2000s, like alt, indie guitar, just heavy shit because that has tempo. Sometimes it's quickly making a playlist of songs, the songs that we were talking about that you forgot about, that you're like, Oh, yeah, I used to love that song because those are nice distractions. Then I found podcasts actually, it does take your mind out of anything that's going on. Certain podcasts, I can't listen to current events. I don't want to hear fucking how shitty the in the world is blowing up while I'm doing this. I just want to hear intelligent or funny people take my mind off shit.

[01:17:57.340] - Speaker 1
Tell me about fatherhood.

[01:18:00.900] - Speaker 2
That's the best one. I don't know. It's so, again, cliché, but I didn't have my first kid till I was 47. I have two daughters. I'm so glad I didn't do it, even though I thought of myself as being a good dad. I was like, I can't wait to give myself to something. But to be honest, the way that I worked and the way that I traveled for work and studio and DJing and all that shit, I wouldn't have been around. If I had kids back then, I'm sure I would have worked it out and I would have changed my life. But I'm also really grateful for so many reasons it happened when it did. Also because that's when I met my wife. It's amazing. Lucky enough to be working, mostly in New York, I ride my bike, I'm five minutes from home, I can go for bath time. If it's important, come back to the studio. This is the first record I've ever worked on since I've become a dad. It is a little tough realigning that old part of me that was just like, If you're not in the studio 14 hours, who are you?

[01:19:10.960] - Speaker 2
Or if you're not doing that work ethic or There are certain things that are true. I think you leave the studio for an hour and a half. You are maybe offsetting maybe some zone or some flow state that you might have been in. But that all It just sounds a bit like what ifs and excuses to me because I want to be there. I want to be present for my kids. But yes, as I'm working on this record, there is this slight push and pull between like, But no, but I used to be the guy. I would drop everything and fly to LA the next day for the chance of working with X person. It's not that anymore. I know that, of course, a certain aspect of the music going to pay the price for that.

[01:20:02.280] - Speaker 1
Tell me about your experience composing for movies. That's a relatively new thing for you, yes?

[01:20:07.920] - Speaker 2
Yes. That I love. Right now, it's working on a film at the same time as I'm working on my own record. When I'm working on my own record, I'm picturing dance floors. I'm picturing who's listening to this. I'm picturing this. There's certain constraints and things that go on my mind. When I'm writing for the movie, I'm just going off of pure emotion from what I'm getting out of the script. I know that we'll shift it and whatever will happen when we start to put it to picture, there are these things. There's a director above me, and they're going to be telling me what they want, sure. But there's something without some of those rules of pop music, I find a little bit freer and say what you want about it, the I'm just Ken song from the Barbie film, I had never really written lyrics for a song before. I never really sat down at the piano and done the whole thing. I always work with such great lyricsists and people with such a strong viewpoint. But I was so inspired by the script and reading it. I just sat down on the piano and came out with that chorus.

[01:21:19.820] - Speaker 2
If I was thinking in any way, shape, or form that Barbie was going to be some blockbuster movie or that anyone was ever going to hear this song. I think it goes a little bit back to what we were talking about before, stretching out a little harmonically and genre-wise and getting more experimental and weird, which is what some of my favorite people do when they make pop music anyway. But for some reason in my head, I've decided that when I make pop music, it's this, and when I make film music, it's free. I should be fucking bringing some of my film energy into my own music, and that would be a good thing to do.

[01:21:56.720] - Speaker 1
Maybe it'll happen eventually. Maybe you'll tuck yourself into it.

[01:22:00.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I wonder how Trent Rezner, who I don't know personally, but Nine Inch Nails is one of my favorite fucking bands as a kid, their first album. He manages to do great Nine Inch Nails records and do really weird score shit.

[01:22:17.080] - Speaker 1
Is the club all about dancing, or is there more to it?

[01:22:22.780] - Speaker 2
No, there's definitely more to it. That's why I called the book Night People, because part of it, outside side of just the DJing and that side, that emotional side of it, and the '90s. This isn't what I set out to do when I started, but what started to unravel was like, Oh, yeah, we were all out at night. I say this in one of the chapters. It's a difference. There's people who enjoy a night out, and then there's night people. Night people is like, you live for the night. You're like, maybe you're a little broken, a little damaged. I mean, everybody is, right? But there's something in the day that makes life just a little bit tough. And night gives you this coat of armor or maybe this extra sense of confidence or swagger and also God knows, it's like if you took drugs, it's probably most likely you're doing that at night. There's something that we're running from, running to, I'm not sure. But there was a community of us. And there are also people who are night people because they really just love to dance and they love music or they love the sense of commune.

[01:23:35.940] - Speaker 2
There's people that loved it because they wanted to fucking go and get laid. People want to get fucked up. But I wanted to look at that. There's no set definition to this. It's a term I made up. I'm not a psychologist. I'm not getting to the bottom of everybody's thing of why they're out. But I just noticed in my community there was that. I know for me, I liked it because I love DJing because I grew up in a broken home and it wasn't the most pleasant place to be. I like the idea of this booth. It was this thing that I could shut out the world, essentially. I am the command of this thing, and every fucking fader and dial bends this fucking place the way I want. There was a little bit of that. I took drugs, and I'm sure I was running. I presented as so together and functioning. But then a couple of nights a week when the gig was over, I would go and obliterate my mind. So nightlife is, yeah, it's certainly more than just about a club.
