[00:00:07.720] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. I grew up on a dairy when I was a child for a few years, and I milk cows when I was 12 and 13 years old. But my dad was not a traditional dairyman, and his father was not a traditional dairyman. My grandfather was actually a school teacher, the son of a Presbyterian Minister. Dairying was in my blood a little bit as a child, but it wasn't something that was traditionally a multi-generation thing at all.

[00:00:50.360] - Speaker 2
When did you first come to realize the benefits of raw milk? Did you know that your whole life?

[00:00:55.600] - Speaker 1
No, not at all. You have to get a perspective of my whole pathway of how I got to where we are today to understand why raw milk is so near and dear to me and what's going on with raw milk. I grew up on a farm, and then first thing out of high school, I worked in a mine for the mountains, and I saw this guy that was almost killed. The timber hit him in the head. It's way up in the Sierra and about. It's Teledine Tunction mine. And the helicopter was called to pick him up and take him away. This is like 1980. And I just couldn't get over the rotor wash and the paramet paramedic that jumped out with his orange jumpsuit and the nurse with him, saving his life. I thought, You know what? I got to be that guy. I got to be that paramedic. I went off and I got my premed done. I became a certified paramedic, and I graduated top of my class. I spent 17 years as a certified paramedic and a preceptor and a medical educator. As a medical educator, I taught paramedic medicine. I had 15,000 paramedic calls over that 16, 17 years, and I taught paramedic medicine.

[00:01:58.280] - Speaker 1
I was an operations director, did everything you can imagine, ACLX instructor, everything in paramedic medicine. It all came to a breaching halt in 1996. My grandparents had passed away, and the farmground, we had a thousand acres of land out here near Fresno, California, was available. And my brothers were off doing things in Silicon Valley doing other things off-farm, and they didn't want to farm. And I was over dead bodies and shootings. It was exhausting, 24 hours shifts and the emotion of dealing with children with asthma and the compassion they needed, the wounds in your heart as a paramedic, pretty tough. So I said, chapter over. So we took the family farming operations and I said myself, I want to be consumer connected, not processor connected. I don't want to sell to a processor, I want to sell to people. And that went through various different iterations for about three years to figure it out. And Rick, the most compelling thing that drove me to become a raw milk dairyman was we were producing organic alfalfa, selling it off to be used by organic dairy. I said, Well, why don't I feed my own cows? I did it as a child.

[00:03:06.290] - Speaker 1
I said, Great. So we started our own little organic dairy here selling our milk to be pasteurized. But my brother Adam worked for Apple Computer. He was right down the hallway from Steve Jobs. He said, Let's put up a website. This is like 1999, 2000, which is very early in the internet. He put up a story about what we were doing here at McAfee Farms. Lo and behold, people looked at that and said, We want your milk raw. I said, I'm all ears. I want to hear. What really transformed my soul was I got a call from a guy named James Stuart, and he's in LA with the garage, the Rossum story. He said, How fast can you drive down here with a bunch of ice chest in the back of your car with a bunch of raw milk for us? Because Altadina just went out of business in Los Angeles in May of 1999. We need raw milk. We don't have any. My wife and I, Blaine and I, got in our suburban and put a bunch of ice chest at the back with a bunch of milk we bottled out of our bulk tank.

[00:04:04.810] - Speaker 1
No labels on it or anything, all hand-capped, just very illegal. We drove it down to LA and we drove into this back alley in Venice Beach called the Garage. It was a place that you could buy everything you couldn't get in the store. Amish food, various different things. There were movie stars there. There was all kinds of people there. I don't know how many people. I didn't count, but the entire alleyway was packed with people. I would say 100 people, 80 people. I don't know. But And we drove in and people started to cheer and jump up and down and go crazy because raw milk was there. And they opened up the back of our suburban and started grabbing raw milk out of the back of these ice chest and just throwing 10 and $20 bills into the car saying, Please come back tomorrow. You're out of milk. You're out of milk. These 150 half gallons are gone. And my wife's a nurse. She has her master's degree in nursing, and she delivered babies, labor and delivery for many years. So here you got my wife, who's a nurse, and myself as a paramedic. We see all these people grabbing milk, and this one woman came up and the milk was all gone.

[00:05:08.700] - Speaker 1
And she said, Oh, my God, I have to have some milk. My child has this problem with her brain. She has a seizure disorder, And she has to have the raw fats for her seizure disorder. And Altadita has been out of business for a while, and we haven't been able to get raw milk, and she's having a hard time. Her medication is not working anymore like they should. And my wife went up to this gal who grabbed eight gallons. She took back three or four, and she gave to this woman who was crying, saying for free, she gave him this milk. She said, take this home, you need it. Gave back the money to the woman who had taken eight. And that was very compelling to myself and my wife. And we got in our car and we said, we'll be back. We'll be back with more raw milk. We left, we said to ourselves, What the hell just happened? And it was transforming to me because as a caretaker, as a paramedic, as a nurse, my wife's a nurse, we were bringing people food as medicine. They were passionate about it. They couldn't get it in the pasteurized form.

[00:06:02.500] - Speaker 1
And the stories each of those people were telling us went right to our heart. So on the way home, we got on our cell phone, which is pretty primitive at that time in 1999, but got a hold of my son and said, Let's build a creamery right now, get a hold of the state of California, get a permit for a processor's license to make a bottling and everything happen on the farm. So we got a hold of the state. They said, Yeah, you could do it. It's legal. No problem. Al Zina did it for 50 years. And so we bought a big, huge reefer van. It had a chiller on one end. We put a wall in the middle. We bottled on one end. We stored it on the other end. And James Stuart, the Rossum guy, came by with his truck and picked up our milk twice a week. And we built a million dollar market the first year. So that's the genesis This is the beginning of raw milk. But then I became very good friends with the Stevies, which owned Altadina, and they told me their trade secrets. And I hung out at the farmer's markets and talked to the moms with a heavy accent from Germany and Russia that said, We want our milk back home.

[00:07:00.020] - Speaker 1
We started serving people, and that was very, very transformative.

[00:07:03.740] - Speaker 2
I used to shop at Rossum myself.Oh, boy.It was such a great scene. What do you know about what happened? I've only seen videos of what looked like a SWAT team with machine guns coming in, but it wasn't a drug bus. They just took the milk.

[00:07:19.390] - Speaker 1
I know the story extremely well. I was down there within a few hours after that event happened. James Stewart and I were very close during that period. It was a raid. It was a raid to send a message to those that didn't line up with what conventional thoughts were supposed to be. And James was basically operating outside of normal. And they didn't like that. They didn't like it for lots of reasons. The transactions weren't taxed. They were this, that, and things going on, and they didn't have the proper labeling. And Ramuk was going across state lines from the Amish, all kinds of stuff. And so what better way to send a message and stick a gun in your face, right? And that's exactly what they did. And it scared him to death. He eventually was incarcerated, and I was the one who posted his bail to get him out.

[00:08:08.500] - Speaker 2
It wasn't just one gun. It was a whole fleet of people with machine guns. I've never seen anything like it. It was a raid on a small town guy providing a healthy service. You had to join the club to be able to buy anything. You couldn't just walk in off the street. You had to be a member. And he followed all the rules of doing it.

[00:08:29.120] - Speaker 1
Well, What a way to send a message to those that are operating a little bit outside the systems and have 20 guys with AR-15s poking at your head, right? The video surveillance cameras of the Rossum facility captured it all. It really showed the onerous scare tactics at the extreme to control choices we make in food.

[00:08:53.990] - Speaker 2
Everything he was selling was super fresh and super healthy. It was the best of the best.

[00:08:59.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:08:59.740] - Speaker 2
And didn't something recently happen to Amos, the Amish farmer?

[00:09:04.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah. The story is he refused to get a permit to produce raw milk. There are 150 or 160 permits to produce raw milk in Pennsylvania. But he had some issues with his religious convictions about not doing the permit and all that stuff and decided not to do it. And again, government saying, you will comply, you will have a permit, you will be within the confines of our regulatory structure or you're out of business. And And so that's what they did. I've met Amos. I've been on his farm. I know his story well. But what's interesting about our perception, our way of going forward and making tremendous progress is I studied the rules very, very well. And I said, I'm going to comply with every one of those rules perfectly, and I'm not going to fight with anybody. Because fighting with government regulators, they have massively deep pockets, and they've got ARR15s, and lots of guys with bulletproof Fes. So I've always said, They may have the guns and the money, but I got the truth in the moms. And so if you want to really avenge correct, proper, whole food, nutrition, what you do is you teach raw milk.

[00:10:16.210] - Speaker 1
You don't sell it, you teach it. And then you build a hell of a market. And in building a big market, the other side's voices become irrelevant. You've got CHP officers drinking our milk. You got judges drinking our milk. You got school You had the State of California guy, Jerry Brown was drinking our milk. You become so powerful because you are the brand that supplies nutritiously dense foods with all its bioactives intact that gives you that incredible immune system boost. And that is transformative. And you don't need to fight anymore because you've won by building the market.

[00:10:50.590] - Speaker 2
Tell me some of the hurdles that you had to jump over to do it legally.

[00:10:55.600] - Speaker 1
Well, legally, it wasn't that hard to do because there was a permit you went. There's five producers of raw milk in California, but we're probably 95 % of the market share. And certainly on the store shelves, we're probably 95 or 98 %. But here's the thing. You get a permit, you're inspected on a monthly basis. You have to submit for pathogen testing and do all that stuff. And the hurdles are not easy. They're not easy. But what you do is you challenge yourself to be excellent. And you say, That's the challenge I'm going to focus on and always be excellent at it. And the problem is, we didn't get any help. That was the hurdle. We We didn't get help. Everybody wanted us to fail. I shouldn't say everybody, but the regulators went on our side. At least for the first 10 years, they were like, fail, fail, fail. You have to stand up, stand up, stand up. You get hit in the head, stand up again. And you have to learn from whatever you failed on and get better. And that's what I think we did really, really well is always stand up and always own it and always get better, always engaging better science, better technology to test your milk, do this, do that, and learn and get better.

[00:11:58.740] - Speaker 1
Now we've come through that tough valley, that 25 years, and we've earned ourselves deep respect for the CDFA, California Department of Food and Agriculture. They treat us with incredible respect now. We're losing a dairy a week in California because the low milk prices paid for pasteurized milk. They're getting 18 to 20 bucks a hundred weight now. They need 28 to 30 to break even. And we're getting much, much higher than that because of the cost of production. And we also get to set our own prices. And we're serving people, not a processor. We've earned the respect of the regulators because we've stood up, we've respected them, we haven't picked fights with them. We've said, What can we do to be compliant? What can we do to be better? They've helped us a little bit in the last few years, and we actually collaborate now. But we earned that position by standing up repeatedly over 25 years and not being disrespectful by saying, I own it, let's get better, go forward. Now it's interesting to hear the inspectors say, I'm sure I'm glad you're in business because all the other dairies are going out of business.

[00:12:57.680] - Speaker 1
We got a job with you.

[00:13:00.340] - Speaker 2
Walk me through from taking the milk from the cow every step in the process. How does it work?

[00:13:08.430] - Speaker 1
We call that grass to glass. I teach that. We've taught thousands of farmers around the world, including 175 farmers in Great Britain a few years back.

[00:13:18.840] - Speaker 2
That's amazing.

[00:13:19.810] - Speaker 1
The Raw Milk Institute was founded in 2011 to teach farmers how to produce raw milk for human consumption, not raw milk for the processor, which is filled with pathogens. It's It's literally an excuse for filth is what it is. But we teach how to produce very clean, safe raw milk. And the process goes something like this. The right conditions, so the cows are laying down in the right environments. They're not laying down in a bunch of mud. If they're laying down on manure, it's dry manure that's been cultivated and it's a dry pack or pasture or other bed pack where the cows are comfortable and they're not in mud. Nutrition of the cow. Make sure they have a little micromineral. Nutrition is very important.

[00:13:58.270] - Speaker 2
Are the cows all outside?

[00:14:00.430] - Speaker 1
They're outside, but they also have shade. Right now, we're at 110 degrees today in California, and they don't do well in the heat. You want to protect them in the winter from the rain and the summer from the sun. But seasonally in the fall and spring, they'll be outside. They're out today, but they'll be out only in the morning and the night. During the day, they're going to be protected in the heat because they just don't do well at 110 degrees. But the water has to be clean. Make sure the water isn't filled with pathogens like in the 1800s when it did. So the nutrition of the cow is excellent to make sure they have the micro elements and micromineral to make sure that they are really healthy cows. And then you go on further to where you milk the cows to make sure the udders are impeccably clean. So you're getting milk only, not manure and milk. And then make sure that the milking machines are well maintained, that the milk pathway to the bulk tank is very, very clean. They don't have biofilms in it. You can easily have biofilms in the milk and actually contaminate your milk easily.

[00:14:53.320] - Speaker 1
All you want is that clean, delicious milk coming out of the udder to a place we call a rapid chiller or a plate chiller. And that milk from 99 degrees, body temperature of the cow, down to about 35, 36 degrees, just 3 degrees above freezing in literally two minutes. And then it goes to a bulk tank where we send samples off to be tested to make sure there's no bad bacteria in it. And then we take that milk to our creamery where we bottle it, we make butter, cream, cheese, all these products here, wonderful products you see in the stores. Then we rapidly send it off to the stores and it's on the store shelf within a couple of days. It gets a nice 21-day shelf life because it's done clean and it's rapidly chilled. Now, if I was to describe to you, and that milk, by the way, is never commingled with any other dairy. It's our dairy. We take whole responsibility for it. If I was to compare that grass to glass ideology of what we do, that principles of axis with what pasteurized milk is, it's a whole different world. Describe it.

[00:15:49.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's not even the same solar system. It's just that milk is produced rapidly on a conventional dairy that goes to pasteurization, where the concern for the health of the cow is not that high because everything gets in the milk tank, gets pasteurized, who cares? So the milk can come from 50 different dairies and come mingled all together. You pay the guy a minimum wage to throw a machine on the cow that may or may not have a clean udder. So the milk filter is just covered in manure sometimes. And by the way, if you spend a lot of money to have super clean milk, you're actually a fool because it gets combined with everybody else's milk, which is dirty. So where's the incentive to do a great job of cleaning milk? The pride The mind is lost of having excellent milk because it's all combined. The milk is then collected into a bulk tank. And guess what? You don't have to chill the milk immediately. Per the pasteurized milk ordinance, the FDA rule, up to 2 hours to get below 50 degrees. Milk doubles its bacteria count every 20 minutes of body temperature. You're going to get yourself some really high bacteria count, not tasting very good, short shelf life.

[00:16:53.680] - Speaker 1
Milk that's got all kinds of problems because you don't care about the cow's health. So they never test for pathogens, ever. We test for pathogens every day in our milk. So that milk goes to a big creamery where it is then back to food gated. It is pasteurized, it's homogenized. It's then made into milk, butter, cream, cheese, all this stuff. But there are no bioactives left at all. The bioactives are the lactoferrin, the alkline phocetace, all the enzymes, the peptidasis, proteasis, lipaces, all day long, there's thousands of bioactives put there by nature to build an immune system as the first food of life for babies. That's all gone. And it's actually rendered, if you look at the FDA, to be the most allergenic food in America, pasteurized milk, number one. And it doesn't taste very good because it's been pasteurized to death, literally, I mean that, and to render it safe, but also makes it very hard to digest. It's sent out under a generic brand to shelves where it's in decline at 2% to 10% per year because people can't drink it because of allergenicity and the digestive problems. And they're going to everything but milk, almond milk, soy milk, macadamium milk, almond milk, you name it, everything but milk.

[00:18:04.670] - Speaker 1
But now with what we're doing at Raw Milk Institute, what we're doing as raw milk producers, we can get back to the real stuff, the milk that's co-evolved with mankind for 15,000 years. I've been said, Oh, raw milk is such a fad. It's such a fad. I'm sorry, 15,000 years is not a fad. Let's recharacterize this. It's pasteurized milk, which is the excuse for filth from the 1800s. Yeah, it may have saved some by killing the stuff was killing people in the 1800s in certain dairies. But pasteurization has probably met its doom because of a quote from Dr. Bruce German at UC Davis, who's the international milk genomics expert on lactation. He said, Pasturization is an 18th century solution to an 18th century problem we could do a hell of a lot better. Well, that's exactly what we're doing. Clean raw milk with testing and conditions. It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal, and people love it. And so raw milk is absolutely back, and it's back better than it's ever been.

[00:19:06.640] - Speaker 2
If I was traveling and I wanted to find raw milk, how would I go about finding raw milk wherever I am?

[00:19:12.570] - Speaker 1
This is breaking news, my friend. Breaking news. Amazon has raw milk now.

[00:19:18.190] - Speaker 2
No, really?

[00:19:19.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, as of about a month ago.

[00:19:21.620] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:19:22.490] - Speaker 1
And you know what? It's interesting. We didn't have a whole lot to do with that. They recognized the growth trends and all the things we were doing all around everywhere, and they just grabbed it, the data on how popular raw milk is. When you look at the SPINS data and you look at the analysis, how we're growing at 35 to 40% per year, year over year. They said, Well, why should we carry that as a key product for us?

[00:19:43.870] - Speaker 2
Is it difficult to find clean, healthy cows?

[00:19:48.500] - Speaker 1
We have to actually have them ourselves. We have to create them ourselves. We buy the best cows, not the worst. We never go to an auction to buy our cows. We always buy the very best cows. And then we quarantine them for a month, month and a half. We do all kinds of testing on them to make sure that their milk is perfectly fine before they're ever going to a bulk tank. So there's a lot of investment in making sure that our herd is really sharp. And you know what? If they're not, they make fantastic ground beef.

[00:20:17.920] - Speaker 2
You only create milk from your own cows. You don't take milk from other farmers.

[00:20:24.640] - Speaker 1
Never. Never. That's like religion. If you were to do that, you'd bring on on a wave of problems in terms of the pathogens are known to be there. Listeria, E. Coli, 157H7, campylobacter, salmonella, even tuberculosis and brucellosis issues could be a problem there. Those are generally relegated. We've already taken care of those problems. But you want to make sure you know what you got. You can only know what you got in your own herd.

[00:20:53.920] - Speaker 2
If that's the case, does it limit how much you can ever make, or is it something that you can scale with your systems?

[00:21:01.110] - Speaker 1
We are building a brand new creamery. If you've done any research on us, we lost our creamery two and a half years ago from arson. Somebody burned it.

[00:21:09.810] - Speaker 2
On purpose, someone burned it.

[00:21:11.630] - Speaker 1
We don't know who it was because they never found them. But all Every investigator said it was arson for sure. It wasn't you guys, but somebody burned your creamery, and they were never able to find them. So we lost our creamery. We're building a brand new one, a 28,000-square-foot mega beautiful thing that has a lot of agro-tourism, where you can observe all the products being made with school busses coming in, with school kids and everything. An educational site, a mecca of raw milk, with all the best food safety stuff we've ever been able to put together that we've learned over the years.

[00:21:42.730] - Speaker 2
Has anything ever happened like this with Arson of a creamery? Yes.

[00:21:47.040] - Speaker 1
In the last couple of years, three or four years, there's been three or four arson. There was one in McMindle, Oregon. There was one in Reno, Nevada, of creameries that were burned. Very suspicious, don't know why, a thing. Azure Standard had a big fire. So we don't know, and I'm not going to point fingers. We just go forward. But I'm saying on the scaling question you made, Rick, we started dairy number two already, and we took some cows out of dairy number one, bought some additional cows, quarantined them, put them in a dairy. It's in Kings County, and that dairy is also inspected. It comes back to our creamery. Again, we actually rented a creamery immediately after our fire because we had to have a place. And within seven days, it was a miracle. We worked our butts off. 44 hours a day, probably made 25 hours a day. We were up and running within seven days bottling milk, and we did not miss a beat in our markets. But we found a creamery that had been vacated for a couple of years, an old cheese plant. We moved in and we just started scrubbing and cleaning and painting and investigating and doing all the things we need to do to change and brought in the bottle fillers and plastics and labels and everything.

[00:22:51.760] - Speaker 1
We made it our own immediately in seven days, and we're able to get up and get going. So yes, we can scale what we're doing But it must be under operations we control, operating as our standards with incredible ethics, responsibility, testing to make sure that's high quality going to our cranery so you control that. If you let it go out to any old person, you get all kinds of problems. Now, I will say that in the future, that may change a little bit, but that's in the future. You have to incentivize the dairyman. They have to be fully committed, and they have to be set on a benchmark of perfection. They have to have for not achieving that. We're not there yet. That's possible maybe someday, but not now.

[00:23:35.650] - Speaker 2
You have no problem selling the milk you produce. There's demand for what you're making, correct?

[00:23:41.160] - Speaker 1
We're producing about 85,000 gallons of milk a week, and we're short. We're short. We're just meeting demand right now, but I know with our interstate commerce of raw pet food products, I have a feeling we'll be short. So growth has been phenomenal. I would say that one of the greatest things that happened, two things, is influencers like Dr. Paul Saladino. And the fact that COVID was a wake up clarion call, a clarion call that you are on your own to create your own immune system in your gut. That 80 % or more of your immune system is the diversity of bacteria and the ecosystem, the biome in your intestines, the gut. And so when you've got Paul Saladino, a distinguished doctor who's all about nutrition as an example and speaking the truth to people, and other influencers doing the same thing, too, not just Paul. But then you've also got the FDA and the White House and everybody on the COVID thing in March of 2020 saying, I'm sorry, we can't help you. Don't come to the hospital because if you're immunocompromised, you might die. People say, Okay, quick Google, how do you build an immune system?

[00:24:52.870] - Speaker 1
Well, let's talk about the bridge of peace here. Let's talk about the detente of a little bit of negotiated agreements treatment. Breast milk is raw milk, guys, and there's no contest anywhere. The FDA, CDC, NIH, World Health Organization, every physician's organization all say breastfeeding is fantastic for babies because it's got all these bioactives that do these fantastic things to build your immune system. Decreases asthma, colds, ear infections. The studies out of Europe are phenomenal on this whole thing. Well, guess what? Dr. David Dallas at Oregon State University at the International Milk Genomics Consortium in Cork, Ireland, said last year, and we know this, but he said it. He said, Quantitative, various elements found in raw milk between breast milk and cow's milk quantitatively are different. That means you have more fat or less fat or more proteins. But qualitatively, it's practically a lenticle. So that's why we can consume raw milk for the last 15,000 years. And when mom finished breastfeeding, the baby got raw milk from the cow, goat, sheep, horse, camel, rainier. And so we are literally looking at Mother Nature's blueprints here. The blueprints of life. When a baby is born, comes out of the birth canal, what's the first thing it does?

[00:26:06.370] - Speaker 1
It suckles on mom's breast, and it gets colostrum for the first few hours, and then it gets raw milk to build an immune system that did not exist before birth. A perfect food to start off, including a biodiversity of bacteria, the food to feed that bacteria, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. It does three things. It nourishes, it directs, and protects. Three things. So when people post-COVID saw that, and people aren't stupid anymore, they can read PubMed, right? And if not, they can listen to Paul Zaldino, who does read Pubmed, and you find out that raw milk is the most powerful immune system built on planet Earth on purpose for mammals because it protects babies from dying You saw a wave of interest. We've grown 35 to 40 % per year every year since COVID, three years in a row, because people want to have a strong immune system to deal with the future threats. That little flu vaccination dealt with about 25 % of last year's problem. Not a future threat. If you want an adaptive and resilient immune system, you better work on your gut. And raw milk and a wholefood diet will help you earn that wonderful.

[00:27:09.480] - Speaker 1
And I say earn because you got to work at it. Build a fantastic immune system and be adaptive and resilient to the future threat.

[00:27:14.980] - Speaker 2
Tell me about how you built your distribution network.

[00:27:19.540] - Speaker 1
That's a team effort. I can't claim it as my own, that's for sure. It started out with Rossum 25 years ago. You were right there at Rossum. They were the first to sell our milk, but then it branched out into the Whole Foods, and then branched out on the Sprouts, and then it went to Farmer's markets. It grew and it grew, and with more and more interest, people talking to one another saying, You got to get on this stuff. It's delicious. My God, my kids don't have allergies anymore, and their asthma has got better. When that happens, you got this person to person, mom to mom, dad to dad talking about this, and kids love it. How do you build your distribution system? Well, you get the call. People say, Hey, the store wants this product. So Kehe, HEB, they say, We got to serve people because they're barking up the tree saying, We want raw milk. So then you get those relationships. And Josh has worked really hard. My son-in-law, married to my daughter, worked really hard working with those distributors, getting that milk cold, fresh, and fast, two stores across where it needs to be.

[00:28:14.720] - Speaker 1
And we're 500 stores in California and 1,000 stores or more nationally, and it's a top seller. The data is very clear. With pasteurized milk in decline, we're growing like crazy. And so the truth is self-evident. And the market is driving this because consumers are having a very, very good experience with raw milk. It's delicious. And the way we're producing it, it's very, very low risk. You check the news every day. The top line is some new recall being, whether it's onions or pasteurized ice cream, just this last week, a massive recall on that. A cantaloupe is killing people. I mean, if you were to eat by recall, you better just stop eating. Just stop eating altogether. There's been water that's been recalled. So bottom line is, when you're looking at that world of food that has a threat or could, the most scary, most unsafe thing to do is to have a compromised immune system yourself. So in this world, we must take responsibility for our own ecosystem, our own internal microbiome, and build an immune system. What better way to do that by leading off with raw milk and wholefoods? Wholefoods. That means the foods that don't have a long ingredient list with sodium, benzoate, and every other color preservative and crap in there with lots of sugar.

[00:29:27.620] - Speaker 1
No, no, no. We're talking about the ingredient list three or four things tops, or maybe one or two things, or in case of our raw milk, one thing. Yeah, it's a paradigm shift, and it's happening right now.

[00:29:39.730] - Speaker 2
In the pasteurized milk, do they also put preservatives in it?

[00:29:44.550] - Speaker 1
Not that I'm aware of. Now, I'm not talking about all pasteurized milk. There may be some that do. But I do know that pasteurized milk is highly processed. If I was going to drink a pasteurized milk, I would not ever go above just the minimum pasteurized milk. I would not go to anything ultra-pasteurized. Ultra-pasteurized milk, there's a big study that just came out, it was done internationally, on HAAs. That's the Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines. They're found in ultra-high temperature pasteurized milk. Unfortunately, that's the little box milk that doesn't need to be refrigerated given to kids. That stuff's associated with cancer. So if you're going to give pasteurized to anybody, which I don't recommend, I recommend a strong raw milk, it should be a cultured pasteurized, like a kefir that's cultured because some of the life has been put back into it, or yogurt because it's more bioavailable because it's how the living organisms put back into it, it's not dead. But if you're going to drink a pasteurized milk, have it minimally pasteurized, like low and slow or just HTSD, because when you go above 200 degrees, you start cooking stuff, you start having some serious problems with uncoorded side effects that are not good for your health.

[00:30:52.890] - Speaker 2
What is A2 milk?

[00:30:55.020] - Speaker 1
A2 raw milk is fantastic. Nothing wrong with it. But there's interesting. There's a lot of technology, a lot of science about this whole thing. But I'm not a huge A2 supporter. If you think about A2, the Corporation A2. It started out in Australia, New Zealand, and it was all about ultra pasteurized milk, not raw milk. And yeah, there's a difference in the protein, the amino acid, the 60-sense of the allele is a little different. It doesn't have the casomorphine. I'm the only farmer in the room at the International Milk Genomics Consulting Conferences every year for the last 12 years. I attend, surrounded by PhDs, they're way smarter than me, and I listen to all this stuff. And the studies have not been replicated. They only had a couple of studies done in China that were pretty out there and weird. And remember that if you have A2 raw milk, great, fantastic. There's nothing wrong with it all. But there's also nothing wrong with A1, A2. What might be the problem is the fact that our gut, as a human, a host, is very permeable with today's diets. And when you allow some of these proteins to get in your bloodstream and you've got autism or something, you can really have a problem because the casomorphine could make you loopy in your head.

[00:32:03.540] - Speaker 1
But here's the thing, when you pasteurize even A2 milk, you destroy the proteins and the A2 is irrelevant. You caused a car wreck in the milk. So I'm not a big A2 guy, but if you've got a cow with A2 characteristics and she's healthy and she's great, great. Knock yourself out, wonderful A2 raw milk. But A2 is a pasteurized product, it's a car wreck. And they've been sued multiple times. They've been in bankruptcy. Their claims cannot be validated. Again, there's a reason why A2 actually exists and A1 actually exists. Mother's breast milk has a combination of both. It's not pure A2. Because if you ever had children and you've been married, A1 is a marriage saver because it's called a milk coma. The baby gets nourished and goes to sleep. It makes them feel good, they go to sleep. That's part of nature's blueprint for babies to rest after they've eaten, to go to sleep, and mom and dad can have their time. If the kid is constantly alert and oriented because they have none of that casomorphine that's in the milk, which makes you feel good and relaxes the muscles and calms you. It's the feel good thing in milk.

[00:33:04.820] - Speaker 1
I don't think we want to take that out of milk. We want to let nature's blueprint be normal. And so in our dairy, we're probably 85% A2, but we left the A1 in there because We think it's part of the bigger picture of what's natural and normal.

[00:33:19.150] - Speaker 2
How does raw milk interact with other foods?

[00:33:22.300] - Speaker 1
It is the synergistic. It makes the compost pile work. You take food that is not bio bioactive or not bioavailable, and you put raw milk with it, you now have the biodiversity of bacteria and the bioactive elements in it. They start interacting and start making the vitamin D and C all bioavailable, so you can absorb it. Butyric acid found in the butter fat makes the lower gut properly and rebuilds the mucosa lining, which is where foods get digested. So raw milk makes your diet more bioavailable. It makes it more bioactive. So the foods you may be eating which aren't particularly whole. You'll be able to extract the value from it because you've got activity in raw milk.

[00:34:07.300] - Speaker 2
It's almost like it turns it into a liposomal mixture.

[00:34:11.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, you think about the evolution extraordinary pressures, generation by generation for, let's pick a number. How about a million years to bring it to where it is today? Only the good survive. The pressures are incredible. The bad die off and feed the bacteria and other predators, and only the good survived. Well, raw milk is one of those foods which evolved those pressures and survived so we can thrive in our most vulnerable state, which is being a newborn. And we long ago, as cavemen, figured out that, you know what? I'm starving over here. And you know what? That animal over there is suckling on that teat. I need to go over there and do the same thing and started to domesticate that animal wherever it was, a rainforest, a cow, goat, sheep, horse, camel. And wherever mankind was able to domesticate an animal, guess what? They thrived because they had portable milk. They had portable food supply. And if they got really hungry, they could kill the animal or the soft spring. You see the Maasai in Kenya, thrive on raw milk. World class long distance runners, tall, strong, strong teeth, Maasai, they're black as coal, right?

[00:35:18.500] - Speaker 1
They're black. They come to America and they all have lactose and tolerance. They don't have the problem. They have no problem at all. The problem is in the processing of the milk. The bioactive are gone. You can't digest it anymore. The same with those in Asia. You go out to outer Mongolia, Manchuria, there's more horse milk being consumed that you can shake a stick at. They have no problem with lactase intolerance. They don't have the lactase persistence gene. But if you go into China, they have lactase intolerance like crazy. But it's the problem with the processing, not the milk. So I'm a big proponent that pasteurization is actually very racist because of the fact that it sorts people out saying, You're not good enough. You're not white enough. You're not Northern European enough to drink milk, when raw milk is good for everybody around the world because it brings with it its own bioactive elements for self-digestion and assimilation. So it's the food of the ages.

[00:36:12.800] - Speaker 2
So many people talk about being lactose-intolerant now. Have you had experience with people who have a history of lactose-intolerance, trying raw milk?

[00:36:22.960] - Speaker 1
That's a core concept here. I would expand it to say it's not just lactose-intolerant, people thrive through with raw milk. They have no problem with raw milk. But it's also something we call maldigestion of milk. Maldigestion is those things beyond lactose sugar. It's the proteins. It's the other things found in milk that have In raw milk, the proteins have an accompanying enzyme, the proteases, the peptidaces that are destroyed in pasteurization to extend shelf life so it doesn't break down. When you want milk to break down quick, when it gets warm in the gut, you want it to go now. And that's exactly what raw milk does. We know that for a fact, and there's a study done by Dr. Chris Garner at Stanford University. He went out into the public and he said, Anybody with lactose intolerance that can't digest milk, let me know. We want you to be a part of a study. This happened back in 2015 or '16. He got 400 people plus or minus that responded. I can't remember the exact date. It was about 400 people that responded saying, I have a hell of a time with pasteurized milk. It causes pain, gas, everything else.

[00:37:24.960] - Speaker 1
You know how many people survived to get into the actual analysis of the lactose intolerance test? It was 16 people got into the actual survey, 16, because they were the only ones that actually blew a positive HBT or hydrogen breast test, where clinically diagnosis lactose Intolerant. Whatever happened to the other 400 people or 390 people that couldn't digest milk. They have no problem on raw milk. So I think it's fascinating to know that it's much broader than just lactose intoler. It's maldigestion of a highly processed food that people's gut can't handle, but they can handle. Everybody does great on their mom's milk. No problem at all. But I tell you what, you started doing highly processed milk that doesn't have the accompanying enzymes and bioactives available and probiotic bacteria. By the way, there's not that many people that have lactose intoler with yogurt. There's a reason. Even though it's been pasteurized, it's had some CPR done on it. It's been brought back to life somewhat by the additional bacteria, and it's been cultured. So cultured dairy products do not have the prevalence of as much maldigestion and lactose intoler. Still has some because the bioactives are missing, but it still has some life put back into it.

[00:38:33.650] - Speaker 1
So it's very interesting to say that raw milk has not only all the yogurt bacteria, but also much more than that with the bioactives that are destroyed by pasteurization. So these are the foods that have been accompanying mankind, co-evolved with mankind for 15,000 years at least.

[00:38:47.420] - Speaker 2
Do you know anything about the main ingredients in popular baby formulas today?

[00:38:53.600] - Speaker 1
Maldodextrin? I can't even spell it. It's fake sugar. It's not lactose from mama. It is It's all kinds of weird things. And you look at the ingredient list, they're too long to memorize. And that ingredient list is not something you want to have in a baby's belly. And it wouldn't be something you find in raw milk. And it's interesting, our sales jumped tremendously a few years ago when there was a national baby food shortage. Everybody said, Get on raw milk, get on raw milk. Kids thrived on our raw milk during that period with the baby food shortage. So, yeah, anytime When you try to extract something out of raw milk and make it a pill or a potion or a formula afterwards, it's missing its matrix of hole. It doesn't act the same way when it's extracted and it's treated in some funky, weird way to put into some other food. It's meant to be in its blueprint matrix of the evolutionary solution of food. It's proportionally perfect. Everything's about it. When you put in a baby formula, it's mankind in a lab trying to fake mother nature and don't work very well at all.

[00:40:02.890] - Speaker 2
If you freeze raw milk, does it hurt it?

[00:40:05.850] - Speaker 1
No. We have to remember that frozen eggs and sperm make life. You can create a baby from a frozen sperm and egg. So there's very, very little change. Over time, over five or six months period of time, we know that there's slight changes. Absolutely, some nutritional values change, but the bioactives are still there, the bacteria are still there, enzymes are still there. We know this from all the tests done on breast milk baking. Breast milk baking is all frozen milk, and that's meant to preserve what's coming out of mom's breast for a month or two or three. But we don't suggest six months. We suggest two or three months is not a problem at all. There's no change.

[00:40:40.450] - Speaker 2
Tell me the difference in shelf life between pasteurized milk and raw milk.

[00:40:44.540] - Speaker 1
Raw milk, when done expertly and rapidly chilled, gives you three to four weeks if you keep it cold, or else it becomes another food. It doesn't ever become dangerous. It just co-evolves by souring, fermenting, lactofermenting, to become its own natural form of kefir. It wants to become kefir. So pasteurized milk, 18 to 21 days. It's actually a little shorter than raw milk.

[00:41:07.950] - Speaker 2
That's unbelievable.

[00:41:09.400] - Speaker 1
That's the low temperature pasteurized milk. That's 145 degrees in 30 minutes. That's called low and slow. 21 days. And it doesn't taste very good. But let's go to the higher temperatures. You go to 175 in 15 seconds. You go to 220 in 4 seconds. You go to 282 in 2 seconds. The ultra-high temperature pasteurized with culinary steam injection Now you get 60 to 90 day shelf life or even a year shelf life, but it is completely dead.

[00:41:37.080] - Speaker 2
It's like water. It's white water.

[00:41:40.190] - Speaker 1
It's toxic because remember, it holds HAAs. It's got this aromatic ammium proteins, which are actually oxidated, which causes and triggers and are associated with cancer. So that highly cooked stuff is quite dangerous, really. Although it's been the greatest savior of organic milk because you can send it around all the that want this wonderful milk. But the shelf life completely occludes and shades the gut life. And what are we looking for? Gut life if we want to build an immune system. Remember that the Department of Energy started doing research in 1990s and was actually mature and actually reported to Congress about the human genome. And that whole study revealed that we have to have a biodiversity of bacteria for our genome to work properly. We may get 23,000 genes from mom and dad to make us look like we do. But I tell you what, the way we function is driven by bacteria and viruses and the DNA of the bacterial biome and virome that we are in and on. That has not been a very popular discovery because it really flies in the face of overdoses of using antibiotics all the time and preservatives in food.

[00:42:49.820] - Speaker 1
And so it's a very, to quote Al Gore, a very inconvenient truth to say, yeah, antibiotics are great to save a life, but boy, they destroy the system, and you better not use them very often because if you do, then you have antibiotic resistance and you also destroy your gut microbiome and become compromised in your immune system, and you can get sick from anything. So let's be very, very cautious with modern medicine. It should be used very sparingly. We should be relying much more on nutrition and avoiding all this stuff and only use it as the last-stitch effort. So I am a big believer in synergizing, putting together modern medicine, but having it be 10% of the solution. And 90% of the solution is literally farmers over pharmacies and looking at what they're doing in France and Italy, where they're just pushing farmers markets and getting fresh good food for people, farm direct foods. But the problem with that in America is the processors don't win. The farmers do. The farmers and consumers win. Processors, they have to take a different position because they have to start thinking about nutrition versus profits.

[00:43:54.310] - Speaker 2
Why do you think there's a fear around raw milk when there are other foods like fresh fish? If you buy fresh fish, you know in a few days, it's liable to be a problem.

[00:44:07.690] - Speaker 1
You're right on, Rick. You're right on. I stood in front of Farmer's Market's tables for years of my life in LA, and I heard, I don't know how many thousands of people speak about their story as we were talking back and forth about Ramo. You have this beautiful young lady coming out of the Ukraine, coming to you with this broken Russian accent with gorgeous children and straight teeth, and she's not obese, and she's looking great. She's saying, please, I want four gallons of raw milk like I got back home in her broken. And I say, wonderful. You get this mom that comes up saying, I don't want to have anything to do with raw milk because it's that stuff kill people? Isn't it really dangerous? And she's obese. She's diabetic. Her kids are running around with ADHD, going crazy. Her teeth are falling out of her mouth. And a few times, I was at that farmer's market table. I said, Will you two moms go have chit-chat together? Because you guys got to straighten this out. You look at yourselves. Look at how you're presenting here. So it's very much we've had it driven our brains that raw milk is absolutely dangerous.

[00:45:10.400] - Speaker 1
It's a marketing campaign by processors. And the FDA, the processors are one and the same. And the reason that's the way that is, I've been there, I know. The NCIMS, the National Conference of Interstate Milk Shippers, is the party, it's the group of processors. They get together with the FDA every year and they talk about the science of processing. And they talk about the pasteurized milk ordinance. They talk about what they should do, they shouldn't do. One time in 2007, the raw milk guy, I was there and I did a presentation in front of that group of people. And I tell you what, the quote afterwards was, you could have heard a pin drop. And it was like saying there is no God at the Vatican. That's what they said my speech sounded like to everybody in the room, because I was saying, we don't need you. We need to go farm to consumer direct because your processing is screwing up the milk and all they were with processors. So this is very much driven by the FDA and a scare tactic, and they do it continuously. They'll find any excuse they can to scare people from raw milk, and they absolutely refuse, refuse to ever meet with me and look at our science and look at the Raw Milk Institute science.

[00:46:20.270] - Speaker 1
There's all kinds of stories I have about that. The bottom line is they are stuck in their paradigm. And if you're trying to make raw milk fit their paradigm, the processors wouldn't It's it. Their paychecks depend on supporting processors. Why they say a hungry mouth cannot freely speak. So if you lose your paycheck, you really don't have a platform to talk anymore. So that's where they're at, right?

[00:46:44.610] - Speaker 2
Tell me the history of raw milk, how it was used, accessed, delivered from earliest times to before it became difficult to get.

[00:46:54.180] - Speaker 1
Sure. 15,000 years ago, the science says that raw milk was collected in gourd or containers From cows, goats, sheep, horses, camels, rain deer, donkeys, water Buffalo. Anybody that's got a teat got milk, right? It got milked into something that was not clean. It held milk from last week. And that milk had cultures in it. Bacterial cultures that were local cultures that were inoculum, the mother culture, the Messiah have it. They literally have the mother culture in their gourd, and they'll milk directly into that, which immediately causes a culture of milk to be created, which is a local kefir, which has a very long shelf life. And then you can take that milk, that clabbered milk, and you can put it through a cheesecloth and create farmer's cheese, add some salt, add some herbs, and you had food that would last months, if not years. It got better with time. That was 15,000 years ago. We were literally starving, and hunter-gatherers said, I see a cow, goat, sheep, all these animals, and I want to get some milk out of that because I'm hungry. And you don't have to farm anymore. You don't have to wait.

[00:47:56.210] - Speaker 1
You don't have to fish. You don't have to hunt. Sometimes the hunted got hunted themselves. The hunters got hunted. So it's much safer to have a domesticated animal. And that happened all over the world. Not everybody had that, but it was a lot of people that thrived had those things. All the ancient cultures, Romans, land of milk and honey. Land of milk and honey wasn't pasteurized, guys. What would Jesus eat? You think about that through history. Coming through to modern times, the first settlers in America, no pilgrims stayed in America before the arrival of the first cows. Jamestown had cows. Everybody had to have a musket and a cow or you died. That's That's the history. So we were founded in America and Canada with cows and goats as part of our, literally, our living environment. We lived by them or our neighbors next to them. So the bacteria they had, we had, and the milk they had, we consumed. So let's look at the very interesting time period of 1860s through 1890s. Well, we were starting to build bigger cities, and people were bringing their cows into the city and out of the environments in the countryside, which was clean, fresh water, the streams, and grass, and sunshine.

[00:48:59.750] - Speaker 1
And that environment, you could actually coexist in a biome that worked. You're okay, you're good to go. You didn't get diseases or problems with the cow. But you take the cow into a downtown area in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Moscow, even Great Britain in England. It happened there, too. And you started feeding those cows what was available, which was the byproduct of brewers, which is distillers' mash, and no more green pastures, and no more clean water, and no way to clean the milking systems because you milk by hand. And it was really cold in the morning, so why not put your feet in milk because it warmed your feet? Freaking disgusting, okay? So that milk was called the milk problem, and there was two solutions that were proposed. Dr. Henry Quoet said, Clean up the milk, go out to the farm and get it, do some testing, and it's great for kids and fantastic. And that milk was going to the Mayo Clinic to heal people. That was in 1893, Dr. Henry Quoet, the American Association of Medical Milk commissions. And by the way, Altadina was the last AAMMC certified dairy in America, and they closed in 1999.

[00:50:00.990] - Speaker 1
The other solution was proposed was Nathan Strauss. Nathan Strauss brought in what's called the power boiler, which was early pasteurization technology for France. He said, Just cook the hell out of it. And what he did, 40% fewer people died because you killed the milk. Yeah, it was a solution for filthy milk. But also during that time, the water quality was very poor. And so water was causing a lot of disease and illness as well. So you had water and cleanliness together caused the problem with this milk problem. And so raw milk, as the AAMMC Dr. Henry Coit and the Nathan Strauss pasteurized Milk, lived in semi-harmony for about 40 years until 1930s and '40s. You enter World War II, we didn't have any money, and DDT was good for your skin, and smoking was good for your lungs, and nuclear bombs solve social problems. So we were not really embracing Mother Nature at all in the 1940s. It was an ugly time. Nutrition was to the back. We had margarine, terribly oxidative, horrible, vegetable oils, baking fake butters. I mean, it was disgusting. That is when pasteurized milk won over raw milk, because raw milk was a processor's dream to get rid of raw milk so they can own it all and they could use their technology to take care of bringing milk in cheap, really cheap from all these dairies and not worry about quality because you're going to cook it.

[00:51:25.310] - Speaker 1
So raw milk died off in the '40s and it petered out to the end with Altadina, with the certified raw milk. We captured on a new phase of raw milk, a whole new world, an evolution, a generation of raw milk, where we embraced the AAMMC in the conditions and the health and nutrition. But we also married in modern technologies, the PCR and other testing, to find and make sure there was no pathogens. Because remember this, in the modern raw milk, we no longer have the immune systems that we had in the 1800s, which is very strong. The biodiversity, eating whole Foods only without modern processing. So we can endure a bug or two without getting sick. Yeah, people die of illness. There's no question they did. But the fact that they could tolerate the environment around them and thrive was something that came from the 1800s. We do not have that anymore. Now we have compromised immune systems because we embrace wholly, terribly processed foods with lots of preservatives, sterilized foods that don't have the biodiversity, and antibiotics. I think one of the most telling things, and I come as a paramedic saying this, one of the most telling things incredibly the inconvenient truth in modern medicine.

[00:52:32.400] - Speaker 1
A person is on their deathbed in the ICU with Clostridium difficile, C-Dif, which kills tens of thousands of people a year when you've exhausted all the antibiotics. What's the therapy that literally saves 92 % of people's lives is fecal transplant. Fecal transplant. Going to a nurse that is eating a West City Price diet and drinking raw milk or whatever, got a fantastic gut microbiome, and taking her faecings, her fecal, having her take a poop in a bag and taking it down to the lab and putting some water with it, making a solution, and flushing the lower gut, saved 92 % of people's lives. What the shit, right? That's the shit. The bottom line is that tells you a whole lot about what's needed in the gut. It's not antibiotics that are needed. It's whole food, nutrition, the bioactives, the bacteria. That's what heals the lower gut. That's extremely telling about modern medicine hitting its dead in terms of in the ICU, doctors are literally excess to heaven. That's it. They're dying. And it saves their lives. When you've run out of modern medicine, you go to fecal transplites. So that's really telling.

[00:53:44.310] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Weston A. Price?

[00:53:47.590] - Speaker 1
Sally Thelen and Weston A. Price and the Price Potterger Foundation before Weston A. Price were all foundation for the core of the educational programs and the studies that Dr. Weston Price did around the world. He studied the nutrient dense foods in the Messiah. He studied those in Switzerland. He studied all over the world and discovered that these nutrient dense foods with raw fats and these raw proteins and these nature's wonderful bounty that comes from the soil and the animals were literally the reason why they had straight teeth and well-formed bones and lived healthy lives and didn't get sick. And so, yeah, they're the core of what we all started. We've gone beyond that in terms of the broad spectrum in the mainstream now, but they were They're the beginning for us, for sure. Absolutely. They always stay in our hearts. They're the core.

[00:54:34.280] - Speaker 2
What were the specifics of the Weston A. Price Diet? What was good and what was bad?

[00:54:38.660] - Speaker 1
It wasn't the same around the world. The Eskimos didn't eat the same things as the Messiah, but they had common things. They all had raw fats. They all really embraced organ meats. They always had nutrient density, which is very high. They also did some other things. They really learned from the ancestry coming forward what their grandparents had done. So they always did multi-generational education nutrition. The water was excellent. The nutrients found in the water was excellent. So that was the common thing around the world, was nutrient density. And from different sources, a raw fish in the Eskimo diet versus raw fats in the raw milk in the Maasai diet. So it's very interesting to see that common, the raw fats in the raw fish and the nutrient density, the biodiversity, the vitamin D, vitamin K, grass feeding, all those things came together, were found as a common theme, although they all eat different foods.

[00:55:28.940] - Speaker 2
Would you say raw milk It's alive.

[00:55:31.780] - Speaker 1
A hundred %. It's absolutely alive. And in fermented form, it's even more alive because you've taken it and allowed it to grow and just prosper and flower and bloom because the bacteria grow like crazy, and they become extremely probiotic, extremely prebiotic, which is the food that feeds bacteria, and also postbiotic. Postbiotic, some people don't know what that word means, but that's the bacterial waste products that are building blocks for other things to grow. So with this metabolism that occurs where prebiotics are being consumed by probiotics, postbiotics are actually creating the building blocks for more life. So raw milk has got it all. It's got to have it all, because without it, babies would die. Nature's footprint says, all you have to have is raw milk for the first six months of life as a baby. No water, even. And you thrive. I know people that literally ate a lactovore diet when all they drank was raw milk. So it's not boring. I said, No, I love I love it. I said, Okay, great. Extreme diets are interesting around the world, but some people just absolutely love raw milk because it's so delicious.

[00:56:37.090] - Speaker 2
What are all of the healthy natural foods downstream of raw milk? What do you make raw milk into?

[00:56:43.640] - Speaker 1
Kefir, number one. Now, raw milk, kefir, low PH, easily digested because it's already predigested. I would say that beyond kefir, you're looking at cream. The reason why cream is so valuable is because raw milk and raw milk kefir You have maybe 4 to 5 % butter fat. 60 %, 6-0, 60 % of the bioactives found in raw milk are carried on the butter fat globule. That says a lot about homogenization. You're destroying the butter fat. You're getting rid of the good things without any real purpose. It's not pasteurization, it's homogenization, crushing butter fat. So cream is very, very bioactive because it's 40 % butter fat versus four. So you got 10 times more bioactives than raw cream. And raw cream Cream is incredibly important in terms of being anti-inflammatory, very good to help the Schwann cells and the nerves be better insulators for your brain. It's just really a superfood, raw cream. Butter has 86 % butter fat, and it hasn't been pasteurized. So the bioactives in it are off the freaking charts, right? You got 4, 40, and 86 % of the carrier, the butter fat, is carrying these bioactives. Cheese is good if it's truly raw cheese.

[00:57:59.960] - Speaker 1
There's a lot of fake raw cheese is running around, and I'm not going to take it away from the guys that are doing the other raw cheese. It's fantastic if it's raw. But there's no real definition of raw cheese. There's a definition of pasteurized cheese. That's you've taken it 145 degrees in 30 minutes. But below that, by two degrees, it's considered raw. Or if you don't have a pasteurizer license, you can take it to whatever temperature you want. Call it raw cheese. This is not regulated. So a lot of fake cheese is masquerading as raw because it's a better market. We make a truly raw cheese that is literally Never taken above body temperature of 100 degrees. Truly raw Cheder cheese. It's delicious. We can't keep it in stock. People buy it like crazy. So it's a nibble food for babies. Kids love it at six months, they just eat it. They eat it like crazy. So butter, cheese, kefir, cream. We have some of those products labeled as for pets.

[00:58:50.410] - Speaker 2
Have you experimented with an ice cream?

[00:58:53.280] - Speaker 1
We make raw ice cream all the time. But the FDA will not allow us to make raw ice because it's a multi-ingredient product and it's not pasteurized. The influence of the eggs or whatever, there's a little bit of value to understanding that it can make somebody sick because you're putting raw things together. But we do it all the time. We use raw eggs and raw cream and honey and all kinds of stuff to make a fantastic raw ice cream. It's very, very popular, but you have to make it yourself, unfortunately.

[00:59:22.410] - Speaker 2
Is mad cow disease still a thing?

[00:59:24.880] - Speaker 1
No. Mad cow disease was over 10 years ago. It was not really ever a problem with raw milk. That was the prions in the brain matter of certain cows that had this disease. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't dangerous. It probably really was. But I'm sorry, we're not cutting up the spinal column of cows and eating it directly. That came out of processing plants where they had mechanical processing of cows and making ground beef that was getting it into the food stream. When you slaughter cows more directly by hand, you actually don't get into the final column at all. But that cow has been dispensed with many, many years ago.

[00:59:59.220] - Speaker 2
Historically, people think of milk as a mucus-producing food. What's been your experience?

[01:00:05.770] - Speaker 1
Well, the interesting thing is mucus is a mucine response. Mucine response is part of the immune system. Well, guess what? When you have the most allergenic food in America that triggers mast cells to release histamines, you get all kinds of mucus. And that's one of the reasons why people are shucking and avoiding pasteurized milk. Raw milk is actually the opposite. The raw whey protein stabilizes mast cells and keeps histamines in check. Raw milk is one of It's the most anti-inflammatory foods on Earth. It keeps the cytokine storms in check. It does all kinds of things. So you don't overreact. You don't over-respond. You do a response and you're back to normal. So it's a very anti-inflammatory food. So our experience with raw milk is it doesn't create mucus at all. In fact, it's contradictory. It keeps your runny nose from running. It keeps your ear infections in check because you don't have the mucus build up or the inflammation. It's a wonderful food that doesn't have anything to do with mucus at all.

[01:00:54.640] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the difference between cow milk, goat milk, sheep milk, and camel milk.

[01:01:00.040] - Speaker 1
Sheep milk Sheep milk has fat globules that are about one-third the size of cow's milk. Their casein proteins are slightly different. Camels milk actually has been researched in Europe, and they say it's fantastic for kids with autism. The elements of the protein found in it, I'm not sure exactly what they are, but I've heard presentations, presentations at the International Milk Genomics Consortium from researchers in Europe to talk about how fantastic camel's milk is for autistic kids. Water Buffalo milk has 10% butter fat, great for making cheese and mozzarella. Every one of these species of animals has their own levels of fat and levels of protein. And mankind has done very well in all of them, as seen by the history of 10,000, 15,000 years. So there are differences, a little bit of flavor difference, a little color difference. Jersey cows have more creamy yellow or milk and butter fat than a Holstein. But all of them, like I said, are qualitatively very similar, but quantitatively different. We are mammals ourselves. We can't forget that. We're mammals ourselves.

[01:01:58.340] - Speaker 2
Tell me about colostrum.

[01:02:01.290] - Speaker 1
Colostrum actually is not milk. Remember that colostrum comes from the arteries, the veins. They're blood constituents, a lot of fats and antibodies that come from the blood of mom that are stored right before delivery of the baby. They're stored in the areas inside of the udder or inside the breast. And that is suckled by the baby as the first food of life to take the antibodies from mom to go into the very permeable gut of the baby that's leaky gut is normal for a baby to absorb those antibodies into the baby's bloodstream. Because remember, the mom and the baby don't share the same blood. The placental barrier separates the two. The baby could have a different blood type than the mom. So the blood is not shared between babies. But the colostrum is a representative of mom's antibodies, the good stuff from mom's antibodies in her bloodstream being shared into the baby's bloodstream through digestive tract and absorbed through the leaky gut. That only lasts for a few hours, maybe a day or two. And then with the ptosine response and the other hormones that are exchanged in the breast and the brain and the pituitary, you start to see a let down of milk and lactating the lactile glands, which lactate, create milk and release milk.

[01:03:13.270] - Speaker 1
And that washes out the remaining colostrum. So you have high levels of colostrum becoming intermediate levels becoming no levels, and then raw milk coming in to wash it. And then raw milk nourishes all of that first initial inoculum that was put into the gut. And then you start putting sugar in there And you're putting Bifidobacteria in there. You take all the bacteria from mom's nipple or the breast or the teeth of that animal being put in the gut, which gives the biodiversity of bacteria in the gut of the child, which is the first experience it has with the outside world. But then you remember the babies put everything in their mouth. What are they doing? They're crawling around on their floor. They're sucking on kitten paws, and they're picking up dog food, and they're putting everything in their face because they're sampling their ecosystem to build that diversity of bacteria, to have an immune system that works in the environment they're in. They're not in a sterile bubble. They're very much wanting to participate and interact with their environments. But raw milk is what feeds them through that process.

[01:04:09.850] - Speaker 2
If you can remember, tell me from that first time that you drove milk down to Rossum, the systems, what were the first things that changed?

[01:04:21.740] - Speaker 1
Well, initially, we didn't do any product testing at all. We just got the milk, and I made a couple of kids sick. I was I was like, Whoa, that was a screw up. What do you mean? I was like, Why? Here I am a paramedic, right? I don't want to make people sick. I don't want to make people healthy. So they didn't die. They recovered fully, and all good. But it's like, Wow, what a learning opportunity for me. So I started testing our milk, and I started using more and more advanced technologies, started learning what practices created what milk. And so it was constant tweaking of those practices to make better and better milk with less and less bacteria that might compromise somebody who's got a compromised immune system. Remember that when I sell milk in a bunch of stores here in California, I don't pick my consumer. They pick me. I don't know who they are exactly. They can reach out and I could talk to them. But It's an unbelievable how many people have compromised immune systems, which could get sick from a bad bug because they want to build a strong immune system.

[01:05:23.330] - Speaker 1
So I've got to be game on for the worst case scenario at all times, which is zero pathogens in milk, but all the biodiversity, all the bioactives to help whoever is consuming our product be as strong as it can be and recover from chemotherapy, right? Recover from antibiotic abuse, recover from a compromised immune system, heal their gut from Crohn's disease and irritable bowel and IBS. So we evolved over 25 years to using very advanced technologies and different kinds of protocols. For instance, we test every subset of 20 cows gets tested separately at our dairy. We're milking 1,800 cows in two dairies, but we treat those cows like they're 20 cow dairies because you can have a bad bug in your milk tank and actually not find it when you can actually find it in the non-diluted samples of 20 cows mixed together. So we treat our dairy like a 20 cow dairy with intensive testing of 20 cows. That's something we learned just the last couple of years. So it's been an evolutionary process of me becoming sharper and sharper and better and better for the last 12 years, hanging out with the International Milk Genomics Consortium, PhDs at UC Davis around the world.

[01:06:29.870] - Speaker 1
I I've been to Arhus, Denmark, twice, Sydney, Australia, Quebec, Canada. I just got back from Cork, Ireland. I'll be going to UC Davis again this year to learn more. They always say, If you're the smartest guy in the room, you're in the wrong room. And so I always try to get myself in a room that I'm always wondering, how do I figure this out? Because I want to learn and be the best I can possibly be as a lifelong learning thing. And why not hang out with really smart people that can't really fully speak because the grants they get come from the FDA, NIH, that are from processors. So I allow their research to become real in our world.

[01:07:04.020] - Speaker 2
Do you teach the practices that you've learned to other dairies and other farmers?

[01:07:09.030] - Speaker 1
Yes, we do. I realized many, many years ago, 15 years ago, that raw milk would not emerge gracefully and with purpose if it was chaotic, if we didn't all understand how to produce raw milk well, if you intended to serve people, not processors. And so the Raw Milk Institute was formed in 2011. We have a board of directors. We have a PhD from Rutgers University on there. Dr. Peckman is fantastic. In the past, we've had Dr. Katerina Berg from Belgium was on our board, a veterinarian epidemiologist in California. She formed us in the first seven years of our lives. So the best brains at the Raw Milk Institute serve on our board. And we have now, we have Sarah Smith, we've got Kelsey Fairfoot, that actually train farmers around the world. And we've exposed farmers, 50 farmers that are actually certified, but we trained 165 farmers in Great Britain alone in 2018, 165 in Great Britain where they have raw milk that's legal on the farm. We've trained and exposed and training thousands of farmers around the world. We have a four and a half hour video series that talks about all the elements from grass to glass that you need to do to have raw milk that's low risk.

[01:08:13.010] - Speaker 1
We've also come up with a pamphlet to send to the Amish that can't have access to online. So we actually put this stuff consolidated down, the old document to give to the Amish. So we've done our very best to penetrate. We've trained farmers across Canada. We've trained farmers in South America, in Argentina. We've trained farmers in New Zealand and Australia. We've trained farmers in India. We've trained farmers all over the world, but they have to reach out to us. We can't reach them. And so farmers that want to learn, it's readily available. And yes, we have absolutely learned that we need to have training for all farmers. In fact, we have two Pubmed articles out now, two that are in the literature by two international researchers. One is Whitehead and the other one is Dr. Berg, from international resources that took our data because we collect data on the testing of the milk for these farmers. And it's so different than what you get from farmers that are pasture pasteurizing or will be pasteurizing. It's filthy milk versus clean milk. And what we've done is we put that in pure view journal, and it's now at the NIH.

[01:09:07.440] - Speaker 1
It's FDA. You can see it at Pubmed, these two articles we have now about how when you do three things, you use very high standards, you train the farmers in those standards and you do routine testing. When you do these three things, you have world-class, very low risk of all milk. And we've done that very effectively for everybody because this is a we project, not a me project. And I'll tell you what, we share our customers. Somebody that's been trained, Rick Anglin down in Arizona. Phenomenal product at Fondoloft serves the customers in Arizona. Guess what? His customers come to California, they get a wonderful product from us. Our customers go to Arizona, they get a wonderful product from him. We're using the same standard. It's not exactly the same, but Very close. So it's a wonderful sharing of people that move around. It's also a great driver of jealousy. When you go to a place that doesn't have raw milk, people say, Why can't I have it? And they get really pissed off. And so it's really driven market to train farmers so that we can share customers. But also when you go to a place that doesn't have raw milk, people ask, Why can't I have it here, too?

[01:10:07.740] - Speaker 2
Are there any places in the US where raw milk is illegal?

[01:10:11.060] - Speaker 1
Yes. Where? Hawaii, Nevada.

[01:10:14.100] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[01:10:15.140] - Speaker 1
There's a lot of places where it's illegal. However, the laws have changed in the last few years to make it legal to buy on farm or buy as part of a cow share, where you buy the cow and therefore the farmer doesn't get paid for the milk, gets paid to care for the cow. I'm very proud that the Raw Milk Institute was very foundational and the change of laws in Delaware. There was a change of law in Delaware. The governor is about to sign it. It hasn't been signed by the governor, but it passed 39 to 2 in favor of raw milk. Because people in Delaware, they've lost so many dairies in Delaware. They're down to 13 now. They used to have hundreds. Thirteen dairies are surviving. They said, We have to have raw milk or we're going to be dying as a dairy. And instead of people driving from Delaware down to Pennsylvania to get their milk and drive back, four hours round trip or more, now they're going to have world-class raw milk with on-farm testing. The Secretary of Agriculture up there, Michael Skuse, said, In my raw milk in Delaware, we're going to have world-class raw milk, the best there is, and we're going to have on-farm labs for every farmer to test their milk every day.

[01:11:16.350] - Speaker 1
It's $2 test, cheap. That's the wonderful leadership we bring to a place that can visualize having the best raw milk instead of saying, no, no, no, no, If you live in the other states where it is legal, can you usually find good quality local raw milk? If you really want to find it, you can. You have to search for it. I was at a National Farmers Union conference a few years back in Hawaii and Maui. There was a mile and a half away. You just have to know where to go get it. You had to know a guy or a girl. So that's what's going on. You have to know somebody or ask. There's a website called realmilk. Com. And realmilk. Com has a search bar. You can find raw milk everywhere in the world. And sometimes it's not called raw milk. Sometimes it's called Beatheopatra's Bath Milk. Sometimes it's called Pet Milk. Sometimes it's a herd share. Sometimes it's something else. But it's raw milk intended for human consumption. And that raw milk finder doesn't really talk about the quality of the milk. It just shows you where you can find the milk around the world.

[01:12:24.960] - Speaker 2
Tell me some of the legal hurdles you've had to jump to do this.

[01:12:30.070] - Speaker 1
Raw milk has always been legal in California, and I have to give credit to Altadina, who stood as a guardian at the gate to make sure the laws didn't change to make it illegal. In areas that did not have good legal raw milk, sometimes the pasteurizers, as a favor to themselves, changed the laws to make raw milk illegal. Some of those laws changed back in 1930s, and that's why it's so hard to get laws changed as they're indoctrinated, literally, in 90 years old law. But as far as legal challenges are concerned, we've been sued by the FDA because We don't fit their model very well. And they bark up a tree all the time. And with the FDA, we say, We want to meet, we want to talk, we want to work together, we want detente, we want you to learn from us, we want to learn from you, we want to have a relationship. They refuse to have that. They go to their friends at the Department of Justice, the DOJ, to have their attorneys talk to us because they don't want to talk to us. Because by talking to us, they admit they must receive information when you communicate.

[01:13:24.020] - Speaker 1
Communication means two ways back and forth. You and I are talking right now. They refuse to talk or communicate with us. They want to be in an arm's length or through an attorney because they don't want to deal with us because we are absolutely upset in the paradigm. They have a set, which is that excuse for Filty Milk from the 1890s.

[01:13:42.930] - Speaker 2
Tell me about milk consumption in other parts of the world.

[01:13:46.730] - Speaker 1
Here in the United States, we made milk a flash point topic. There's a lot of indoctrination about milk and pasteurization and raw and all that stuff. In other parts of the world, raw milk is not a big deal, or it's not It's considered a flash point or a really big divisive or big issue. It's like, Oh, you want raw milk? You want pasteurized milk? Here's a call. No big deal. So it's the culture. It's the indoctrination. It's the role of the processors and also the advertising. The role of the regulators and those that inspect milk in production. Germany has the fortuit milk, very, very early available. In Italy, there's raw milk available. In France, there's raw milk available. You just have to look for it. Sometimes it's more convenient than other places. Almost all those places have really, really good raw milk cheeses and oftentimes have a lot of raw milk kefir, because the kefir is easily made because it can ferment it and then it has a long shelf life. It doesn't require a lot of refrigeration, where raw milk will sour quickly. So I know when I was a child, I was a representative of the United States in Russia.

[01:14:46.050] - Speaker 1
In 1977, I went to Artaq, the international peace camp there, and I represented... I was one of 12 students. I was the only farmer in the group. But they had a raw milk kefir. It was delicious, and we all drank it. I didn't know what it was, but it was delicious, and I drank it every day. So I I think it's culture by culture, place by place, a reflection of the history and processing. I know that right now Europe has really taken a very good, responsible position saying, We want to know the bioavailability of food. We want to know the carbon footprint of the food. We want to know how local your food is. We certainly want people to easily get Whole Foods at a farmer's market, this Farm Direct. I think you see that in the pictures of people and how obese they are walking down the streets in the United States versus in Europe. I think you see that. Unfortunately, it's slipping a little bit some areas which are embracing more of an America diet, which is, please, detour, go back. That's a bad sign. Don't do America. You might want to wear our blue jeans.

[01:15:38.320] - Speaker 1
That's fine. But don't do America. The way we eat sucks.

[01:15:41.700] - Speaker 2
In the US, 50 or 60 years ago, the milkman would deliver a glass bottle and put it in a cooler outside of your door. Was that pasteurized milk?

[01:15:52.920] - Speaker 1
Some of it was raw, some of it was pasteurized. You had to have a certified raw milk dairy. It was certified. It was the A MMC milk. And that milk was very popular. Altadina built a huge market for themselves in LA. Other dairies like in Atlanta, Georgia, there was a dairy there. There was dairies all over America. There was the Gordon Walker, the Walker-Gordon dairy in Virginia. That was extremely popular from 1906 to 1971. Had a thousand cows. They were operated as 100 cow subsets with literally 10 farmers that managed each farm, and they were all milked at the same facility. And that milk went to the Mayo Clinic. It was on the Titanic. It was at the White House. It was presidential food. It was considered excellent, beautiful, delicious food. Rapidly chilled, all that stuff. So raw milk is not as easy to do as pasteurized milk. And so if it's more difficult, it's more expensive. And so it's not as readily available as you're going to see for pasteurized milk, that's for sure, including today.

[01:16:47.180] - Speaker 2
Any feelings about milk in plastic versus glass bottles?

[01:16:52.490] - Speaker 1
We started out for the first three or four years in glass bottles. It was very, very difficult. There's nothing wrong with it. It's wonderful. Except that there's a deposit of $2 for every glass bottle. So you get it to the store, the store gives it to the person that takes it home, consumes it, brings it back to the store. They want their $2 back. Well, if it's got a chip on the top of the glass bottle, the store has If you're not able to get back to $2, the store takes it, the store is stuck with the $2 now, and you get there, you got to take it back and you can't use it. You also have the state testing the glass to make sure it's clean. You have to make sure the milk is clean, and you have to have an extremely sterile bottle. When plastic We source our plastics very specifically to not have any isoestrogens and not have any of those things that are going to leach into the milk. When you kept cold, there's no leaching at all. But if you were to heat the plastic, absolutely it will leach. So you don't want to have any leaching, and heating is what brings that on.

[01:17:44.470] - Speaker 1
We're very cautious of that. But we did glass for the first three or four years. The other thing was that when you put the glass in your truck, the glass weighs a lot. Bringing it back from the marketplace with heavy, heavy trucks that are filthy with all these last bottles was very hard on the as well as the diesel consumption for the trucks with heavy trucks coming back. Or you're not carrying food, you're carrying package for the food. I'm a big supporter of glass, but I tell you what, it's very hard to do.

[01:18:11.340] - Speaker 2
Would there be any benefit in having a glass option that cost more, but for the people who care about that?

[01:18:17.410] - Speaker 1
Maybe, and we might do that. But we always advocate for people, if you want it in glass, pour it immediately into glass and keep your plastic away. That way, it doesn't spend three weeks in the plastic. And some people do that. But we have grown so incredibly ferociously with There's this incredible demand that some of these things we had to put on the back burner because just getting the milk in a plastic bottle to get out to the stores is enough to feed itself when you've got 35, 40 % growth year over year going from COVID forward. It's just having enough milk to get to anybody, anywhere we can to make sure it's safe is the biggest challenge we have at this point. And we're doing better and better and better with it. But at the same time, being glass would be a distraction from that. And it has a different bottle filler, has a different transfer. You have to bring the glass back, you have to wash the bottle. It'll be very tough. We may do it someday, but not right now.

[01:19:03.500] - Speaker 2
How many years do cows produce milk for?

[01:19:06.780] - Speaker 1
That's an indefinite number. They start at two years old, and they go 12, 15, 20 years, depending on how healthy they are and what the environment they're in. Unfortunately, the way the CAFO operations, the confinement animal feeding operations are now, they don't make it beyond four and a half years because it's like a race car. You blow the engine up on a quarter mile sprint, and that's what they're doing, pushing with everything they can to get as much milk as they possibly can, including hormones in some cases, antibiotic use, inflammation, lots of really high, rich foods to get 12, 15 gallons of milk a day. But that cow burns out. That's not our cows. Our cows are usually a moderate diet. We want to have a long, healthy life. We're not looking for a race car effect. We're looking for a really sustainable, moderate production cow that's in peace with herself, that's doing well, that can sustain over the lifetime. Because that's the cow that's going to give you really healthy raw milk. A cow that's a race car, she could have problems, a lot of problems, and many different kinds of problems.

[01:20:05.220] - Speaker 2
Do your cows only eat grass and food on the pasture, or do you give them additional feed?

[01:20:10.980] - Speaker 1
They absolutely need additional feed. They get pasture, yes. And seasonally, more than in the summertime, it's super hot. They don't get that much because at 110 degrees, cows don't do well. But in the spring and fall, yeah, they get a lot of pasture. But we also supplement with all kinds of things.

[01:20:24.030] - Speaker 2
What?

[01:20:25.350] - Speaker 1
Alfalfa. We actually have certified organic alfalfa on our farm that we produce for Our Cows. Our Farm is certified organic. Our end products are not certified organic because we couldn't do local sourcing of cows or additional feeds. We're bringing in organic cows from literally two states away. We're bringing in organic feed from three states away from Colorado with 300 gallons of diesel to get it here. So if you wanted to get organic milk, you go down to the local store, it's ultra high temperature pasteurized. That's not us. So right before COVID, I just come back from a National Milk Genomics Consortium conference in our Houston, Denmark. They were talking about how local is your food, what's your carbon footprint, what's your nutrient density? I was like, Well, that's not very good bringing feed in from four states away. So let's be local. And so we shifted from certified organic on the end product to non-GMO project, which is wonderful, no roundup in pesticides, in our products and be local. So we have a 10-gallon ride from a neighbor that loves us and takes good care of the feed and brings it right here. So we became much more local doing raw with a low carbon footprint, extreme bioavailability of our foods, and more aligned with what they're doing in Europe versus what's being promoted in the United States.

So a lot of things to talk about there.
