[00:00:23.600] - Speaker 1
Today's pool workout was a drill called 15s. The premise is 15 jumps, amoe box, swim their back. So carry the weight, swim and back.

[00:00:37.550] - Speaker 2
The amoe box is still you hold the dumbbell at your chest and swim across the pool.

[00:00:44.210] - Speaker 1
That's right.

[00:00:44.910] - Speaker 2
So you're free. Typically, how heavy is a dumbbell?

[00:00:47.610] - Speaker 1
I mean, I'm doing it. I call it light. Right now, I'm using a 30-pound dumbbell.

[00:00:51.130] - Speaker 2
But if you were to stop swimming, you would sink to the bottom. Immediately.

[00:00:55.950] - Speaker 1
You're sinking if you don't vigorously swim. It's pulling you I call it 15 because there's 15 jumps, and then there's a their-back-ammo box incorporated. And so the first set is 15 jumps, ammo their-back, no breath.

[00:01:12.390] - Speaker 2
And the jump, it will be with like 30.Same.

[00:01:15.080] - Speaker 1
Weight?one.

[00:01:15.760] - Speaker 2
Single 30.Yeah.So it's thenSo you sink to the bottom.

[00:01:19.190] - Speaker 1
The reese, the reese is a single arm. It's like the ammo box swim, but you're doing it vertically. You're jumping with the weight and then swimming with the free arm until you come up and get air, and then you switch hands and you land.

[00:01:33.330] - Speaker 2
Much harder doing it with one weight than two, because when we used to do it with two weights, you could use both arms evenly.

[00:01:40.350] - Speaker 1
When you have free hand, it's pretty nice. That's a lot of power that you get out of your having a free hand.Do.

[00:01:46.840] - Speaker 2
You alternate hands?

[00:01:47.910] - Speaker 1
Every jump, yeah. When you jump, you stroke, and the stroke hand comes down to where the weight is right by your belly button.

[00:01:54.670] - Speaker 2
You hold the weight, you go down 14 feet, you jump. You can only jump maybe eight of those, and then you stroke with the free hand.

[00:02:03.510] - Speaker 1
Usually one big stroke, a big jump and a big stroke gets you there.Gulp.

[00:02:07.620] - Speaker 2
In a air breath, and then you sink again.

[00:02:10.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and exhale before you hit the surface. Right. Letting all the air out before you hit the surface, so all All you're doing is inhaling. Then when you free fall on the way back down, that's when you switch your hand. I see. Then you land, you squat, and you have to jump. If you don't jump hard enough, then you can't make it. Then you end up stroking, struggling, which burns up oxygen, which makes it so you can't do very many reps. That's the basis of the drill, the swim and the jump. Then we break it up. I started the drill with what I thought was six different combinations. The first one is 15 jumps, swim in there, and swim back.

[00:02:48.950] - Speaker 2
After the 15 jumps, you're pretty winded before the first ammo box, which is crazy.

[00:02:56.860] - Speaker 1
And then you breath hole the whole time, no breathing on the You swim there and back, no breathing. But it gets worse because... It starts with 15 jumps, you swim there back with a breath hole. That's the first set. The next set is you swim there There, you do 15 jumps, you swim back. Again, always the swims are always-And you're always carrying the 30. Always carrying the 30.

[00:03:22.560] - Speaker 2
And you're always holding your breath.

[00:03:23.530] - Speaker 1
And you're always holding your breath. The next one is there back, 15 jumps. That's the first three. Then we go into five jumps, swim there, 10 jumps, swim back. Then we do 10 jumps, swim there, five jumps, swim back. Then we do a five jump, swim across, five jump, swim back, five jump. So always 15. I thought the six sets was all there was in that combination. And then my friend said, Well, actually, no, there's two more. I'm like, Well, what two are those? And he goes, Well, Well, there's the swim there, do 10, and then swim back and do five, starting on the other side before you come home. So then you swim over, do the 5 or 10, and then come back and do the five or 10. So that was two more that I didn't know. And then all of a sudden, we discovered two more.What.

[00:04:16.910] - Speaker 2
Were those?

[00:04:17.760] - Speaker 1
Those were... We've gone from six, we thought it was six. Then it went to eight. There can't be any more combinations of five and 10 and a swim back. The other one was do five, swim there back, do 10. Do 10, swim there back and do 5. There ends up being 10. It's a 10 combination. That's why I call it 15s. But it's 10 different variations of 15, which is 15 jumps and a swim back. That's the drill, and that works.

[00:04:50.540] - Speaker 2
It sounds like that doesn't get easier over time.

[00:04:52.600] - Speaker 1
It doesn't. Actually, even when you add weight, unless you add so much weight that you make it almost impossible, but even when If you add weight, it ends up that the weight makes you fall faster, and the lighter weight actually makes you fall slower, so the downtime is longer with the lighter weight. So there's a line there where light isn't really easier because you think, Well, lighter would be easier But because you fall slower, it's not easier because it extends the downtime. Do you ever lose track of count?

[00:05:23.050] - Speaker 2
Completely. You get completely lightheaded doing this stuff.

[00:05:26.460] - Speaker 1
That means it's good. In my opinion, I go, If you lose track, When it's really cold, like this winter, we were swimming in 52-degree water. We were doing breath, hold, swim, their backs, and we would lose count every single time. All we did was 10 laps. All we were doing was 10 laps. You're like, 10 their backs, and no one No matter what, at the end, at seven or eight or nine, you're like, Am I at six? Am I at seven? Did I do eight? Was that nine? And so in a way-And is the rule always you take the lower number? Yeah.

[00:05:57.740] - Speaker 2
You always take the lower number, so you You have to do the extra one.

[00:06:00.840] - Speaker 1
You do because you don't want to fall short. You don't mind going one over.

[00:06:03.860] - Speaker 2
Going extra is okay, but missing one is impossible.

[00:06:06.850] - Speaker 1
That's a no-go. Which you knew that already because you said, Oh, you go for the low one.

[00:06:12.870] - Speaker 2
I can imagine. I know. I've I've seen how you work. I know how you think.

[00:06:19.000] - Speaker 1
You don't want to cut yourself short, but you do. It's almost uncanny. The 15s is more confusing because it's obviously there's 10 different variations. At At one point during 10 variations, you're going to forget either during one of them, like how many... Today, at one point, I was there, I'm like, Was that nine? Or was that 10? Or was that seven? I probably ended up I mean, 16 or 17 or 18 because I just lost track during it or lost track of what one is next. I mean, at a certain point, we're almost writing those things down and checking them because you just can't.

[00:06:58.370] - Speaker 2
You also seem very wide I remember when we used to do the pool workouts, not long after, I would often get the feeling of needing to go to sleep. It wasn't sore. No. It wasn't beat up. You felt good.

[00:07:11.500] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:07:12.600] - Speaker 2
Just like, I need to sleep now.

[00:07:15.480] - Speaker 1
Well, I think it's because the oxygen deprivation. I think when you're low in oxygen, when you're oxygen-deprived, and when you've done enough oxygen deprivation, I think that you just have to recover. I think it's like muscles because you're taking the It's probably pulling oxygen out of your bones. I go, Yeah, any available oxygen when you're going to the wall is getting pulled from everywhere it can in the body. At some point, it's like, Okay, cool. You're done? Go sleep and recover.

[00:07:44.530] - Speaker 2
Tell me the history of pool training from the beginning.

[00:07:47.390] - Speaker 1
The original concept came from the rock running.

[00:07:51.310] - Speaker 2
Something surfers would do.

[00:07:52.640] - Speaker 1
I think rock running originally originated from diving from fishermen. I see. They would take stones out the canoe. When they would go to the bottom to dive, they would just ride a rock down because then you would eliminate all the energy it takes to swim.

[00:08:09.460] - Speaker 2
To swim down.

[00:08:10.040] - Speaker 1
So then your downtime was increased. All of a sudden, you could be down. Then the black coral divers on Maui in the early days of black coral diving, they would ride stones down because they were going so deep. You just couldn't... By the time you swam down there, all of a sudden, you had half the downtime. Then the energy that you burned. So they would ride stones, and then divers and surfers would run with stones in the summertime. So that was like a summertime.

[00:08:40.780] - Speaker 2
To train, to be able to do it. Yeah.

[00:08:42.780] - Speaker 1
To stay down longer. To stay down longer. And be under oxygen deprivation and still work.

[00:08:48.170] - Speaker 2
Do we know the effects of the pressure of being underwater?

[00:08:52.110] - Speaker 1
Well, first of all, if you get the bends, you go into a hyperbaric chamber to make up for the... To put pressure so that you can get the air out. I mean, we know that the pressurization is the ultimate compression wear. At a nice level, it's ultimate compression wear.It's.

[00:09:07.960] - Speaker 2
Protective in a way.Well, circulation.

[00:09:10.540] - Speaker 1
Huge circulation. I think, and I don't know the science, but I've been led to believe that your lymphatic system can get flushed out in an hour of being in water that would normally take you 24 hours because the blood movement is like what compression wear. I think they banned compression in professional cycling becauseIt was such an advantage.

[00:09:34.300] - Speaker 2
Like blood dope.

[00:09:34.840] - Speaker 1
Don't get tired. Guys, don't get tired. Then it ruins the whole idea behind competition. If no one's getting tired, it's like, When does it become interesting? That's why people, when they're hungover, they love to go swim, and you come back and you feel refreshed. I think there's a bunch of benefits. Other than just negative ion absorption and other things, I think the pressurization. Now, when you go really deep, there's some crazy things with the dive tables where you're only allowed to go down. They have these tables talking about how long you can be at certain depths for how long and how often. I knew a Portuguese guy on Maui that blew all of the dive table. The Navy came to meet the guy because he would go every single day for eight hours a day, tank after tank for days and weeks. They said it was technically, they didn't even believe it. They said it was impossible. You couldn't do that. I think one of the side effects that he had was very severe arthritis was one of the negative things. But I think we can endure a lot more of that pressure. But down deep is definitely something that's hard on us.

[00:10:50.740] - Speaker 1
I think once we go below a certain atmosphere, I think there's benefits. It's like hyperbaric chamber. When you go in there, you get all the benefits of that oxygenation. But once you start getting below the third atmosphere, the fourth, and you get down there where stuff starts to get squeezed, I think that can be... I mean, that's why you have to go slow on the way up.

[00:11:08.760] - Speaker 2
One of the things I remember interesting about having weights underwater is you seem to have more control of the weight underwater.

[00:11:16.320] - Speaker 1
Well, it's lighter, too. You lose about 30%, I think, of the load when it's underwater, but you definitely... The stabilization... I mean, that's why your body responds so nicely. When you take somebody, especially if you've hurt and you're coming out of recovery and you got something wrong with your knee or your hip, out of the water, your body doesn't want to go into certain positions. It's protective. When you get in the water, the body feels comfortable because it's stabilized. So that water almost holds you up, which allows you to be more comfortable, which lets the body go into positions that you... That's why it works so well for that, like when you're coming off of a knee or a hip or something.

[00:11:57.150] - Speaker 2
I also remember right in the beginning, having to get When you're past the feeling of holding weights underwater, your brain goes insane. Your brain says, We're drowning. Now, I remember the feeling because I'm holding dumbbells, I'm underwater. I can put the dumbbells down anytime I want. But the mind is saying, you're being held under. You have cement shoes on. Took a while to pass that feeling of DNA level. You don't want weight on pulling you underwater. No.

[00:12:32.730] - Speaker 1
It is interesting that because you watch people go through that, especially when they've never experienced pool training. They come in there, you give them some weights, and they'll have the weights in their hand, and they're literally either trying to swim with weights in their hand or just completely freak out. And then tell them, Hey, all you have to do is just set them down. Even though they hear that and they know that, it's like you've attached it to them and they're stuck with it. It's like they have it in their... You'll see it in their face. They'll have the weight in their hand and they'll look at you like, What am I going to do?

[00:13:08.560] - Speaker 2
You're in the headlights.

[00:13:10.040] - Speaker 1
I cannot let go. I'm being held against my will. And you're like, Well, no, you just set them down on the ground. It's okay. I think that's where a lot of the transformation happens, too, is once you start to be able to override that primal instinct and with conscience Hey, I have time. I can set the weights on the ground. I'll be able to jump to the surface and get air. Once you start to get that part in your head, the word that comes up for me is submission, submitting. I see that throughout other aspects of life in general is just to submit. You gain time, you gain something when you submit, when you're able to justLet go.let go and be, Okay, take me, do what you're going to... That mentality, Do what you're going to do with me. You gain an incredible amount of time, but nothing brings that out like the water does.Ice tub, too.Yeah. I always talk about primal fears that we have that are in our DNA that are affecting the primal part of our brain that has nothing to do. You can say all the things you want, but when you think about animals, you being eaten, falling off of high things, being burned, drowned, frozen.

[00:14:26.990] - Speaker 1
I mean, this is stuff that it seems like your unconscious isn't going to rely on your intelligence to make you make it. It's like, you know what? I don't trust that you can make a good enough decision. I'm going to put you into this mode of freak out so that you get yourself out of the situation, whether it's jump out of the ice or hyperventilate. You see people when they get in the ice. It's interesting. One of the side effects of being really scared is you get cold. We'll be in a warm swimming pool, like a warm swimming pool. People are there, and all of a sudden, see somebody's got the shivers. They're shivering like they've been in an ice tub and you're like, Well, it's not cold. But the fear gets them into that, which, again, I don't know if it just gets them to get out, ultimately. Get out of this environment. It's dangerous.

[00:15:16.760] - Speaker 2
It's probably a protective thing as well. Besides telling you to get out, something good is probably happening in your body.

[00:15:24.590] - Speaker 1
And by the way, it seems like that's always the case. The way it reacts to anything that's... Anytime it's endangered, you get all great hormones, and the body does all these great things whenever it's put in threat. It's like, if I could think of another way to get these benefits, I would. But there really isn't. It's like rosebushes blossom when you prune them. They don't want to be pruned, but the way they flower is when you cut them. It's the same with us, that when we're stressed, whatever that is, whether it's your oxygen or what is working out, working out is stressing the system. What is fasting? Stressing the system. These are all the stresses that we benefit from.

[00:16:05.290] - Speaker 2
We recover stronger after stress. It started with the rocks at the bottom of the pool.

[00:16:11.210] - Speaker 1
It started with the stone carrying. Have you ever done that?

[00:16:15.550] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. What point in your life did you do that?

[00:16:18.380] - Speaker 1
In my teens. I started in my teens. We didn't do it a lot because we didn't have a great environment for it to have clear water like we're on Kauai, where I grew up. The rivers, it's usually murky, hard Hard to see, not fun. It's not a great drill when you can't see. If you're in the Caribbean and it's crystal clear and you can get a stone and run along the bottom.

[00:16:37.400] - Speaker 2
It's typically in places without waves, probably.

[00:16:40.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because that's stirring up the bottom. If there's waves, you're probably riding them. But that was a That was a summertime thing. That was usually summertime, the surfs down. It's a way to prepare your sofa the winter. Again, divers using it to improve breath hold, length of breath hold. That's where it started, pool training, and then weight vest. Then I built a pool thinking, Hey, I'm going to do some breath holds type stuff. And weight vest were another. That was the original concept, which was put a weight vest on and then see how long you can tread. As a way to be better at staying at the surface, that had its own set of problem and fears, because you couldn't take the rate jacket off. Then you'd be right next to the edge, so you could just reach out and grab the side of the pool when you got tired. And if you missed it, it would be Yeah, and you sink down. But the psychology behind it, and the vest put a lot of pressure on your breathing because it was Velcroed on. We still have new versions of that now that are not so restrictive, that have suspenders with these weight things.

[00:17:46.340] - Speaker 2
I tried the weight belt at one point, but I didn't like it as much as the ones that you could put down.

[00:17:51.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you're free with all your limbs because you're not holding them. That was the basis. I built the pool, and then it just was a process of eliminating I think I had an epiphany. One night, I had a vision about when you're a kid because everything we were doing was swimming-based. Everything was on the surface, and I always call it horizontal because everything in the pool when you're swimming is horizontal. So everything's on a flat plane. One night, just something popped in my head, and I thought about when you're a kid, how much you love to go in a shallow pool and jump up and down and come out of the water and get a breath and then go back under and come out. You could do that for hours. That's when I had a little light go off in my head Hey, what if we could jump? Then that's when the weight, the dumbbells came in. Once we got a dumbbell in our hand or in the water, that opened.

[00:18:46.610] - Speaker 2
I remember being around when that happened. Because before that, we were using heavy weights and swimming.

[00:18:52.190] - Speaker 1
That's right.

[00:18:52.880] - Speaker 2
You said, I had a dream. We need lighter weights, heavy enough to pull us down, but light enough where we could jump to the top.

[00:19:00.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and get in there and breathe and get into these rhythms. The horizontal stuff.

[00:19:05.640] - Speaker 2
It became like yoga. One breath per move.

[00:19:09.350] - Speaker 1
That's right. The breath relationship to the movement, that's something that is very controlled by the water because I don't care. You don't have to implement it. The water implements it because you can't breathe under. You can only breathe at the top. You're only breathing when you're getting yourself out of the water.

[00:19:28.290] - Speaker 2
Also, from that lymphatic massage standpoint, going down and coming up, pressurized, depressurized, pressurized over and over. I remember the first time doing it, like trying to get to 10 and then getting to the point where we got to 100. I couldn't believe seeing theseIncremental improvements.

[00:19:46.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, the dumbbell also, too, even before the jumping started, just allowed us... I always just thought, dumbbell is just a rock with a handle. In a way, it's like rocks are so cumbersome, and you had to hold them with both hands and move. Where with the dumbbell, you could just hold it in one hand. That relationship between those two things, when you think about... The best way to describe it is weight lifting meets swimming. It's just a hybrid between the two. You've taken swimming and all the benefits that you have, and then you put them together. But the beginning when we were first doing it, it seemed like every week there was some new exercise or new... I remember, and I think you were there that day, but the one move, the single-armed one that you swim up, I watched my daughter, little Reese, just struggle her way to the top and put the... It was a little weight, but it was like, so she went down and picked it up and jumped and swam. I looked at that and I went, wow, that's a move. That's why we call it the... The Reese.

[00:20:44.550] - Speaker 1
We call it the Reese because it was... But yeah, there was a lot of moves that came out of that. But once we started going vertical and combined vertical and horizontal, the jumping part was the part that really changed a lot of the stuff because the legs use so much more oxygen. So you start jumping. I mean, you look at most swimming, unless it's a sprint, there's no legs involved because legs aren't efficient for swimming, and they burn air. But in our case, We want to burn the air. We're looking for ways to burn air quickly, and you can't beat the leg movement.

[00:21:22.200] - Speaker 2
We don't get to jump as hard as we can in life. We don't. That's not a normal... It feels too dangerous.

[00:21:28.750] - Speaker 1
Well, because landing. It's not the explosiveness going up, it's the landing coming down. And so the water takes away that impact, which has negative... It's good to have that impact for your body, but that allows you that explosiveness and the volume. If you jump-And there's resistance because you're pushing against the water when you're jumping.

[00:21:48.430] - Speaker 2
You're not just jumping your weight, you're jumping your weight against all of the water above you.

[00:21:53.160] - Speaker 1
No, it's true. It's true. Well, that's why the basketball guys go crazy. You think about, if you did 100 jumps on hard ground as hard as you could, the next day, you'd be broken. You'd be hurt, where you can go there and jump 100 times and be like, and the next day not...Feel better than ever.Feel better than ever. I think that increased volume because you're not having the impact, all that lymphatic Even the water running up and down your body is really doing that lymphatic system as well. What do we always say? The proof's in the pudding. It's hard to explain what a feeling you get, and then you add the other... You add the heat and the ice. But in a way, the water is controlled breathing rhythms, controlled breathing patterns in a way that you just can't be that precise. I mean, unless you're just watching a clock, then it's a whole different thing. You're not able to be out of your... I mean, I had today when I was jumping, I was doing... They were saying something about when your eyes are closed, your brain's in a different pattern, like when you close your eyes.

[00:22:59.330] - Speaker 1
I was doing somewhere, when it gets really hard, you close your eyes. That environment, it's a unique thing because it's like somehow you have to submit, but then you have to aggress, but then you have to relax at the same time.

[00:23:15.600] - Speaker 2
It's the weirdest thing. It's like-And you can drown, and it feels like you're back in the womb. It's a very nurturing, peaceful environment in the water. It is.

[00:23:28.080] - Speaker 1
Can't talk. It is. No. I told somebody one day, I remember just what you said brought that to my mind. Outer space is in your backyard. Because when you think about outer space, there's no gravity. There's no air. It has some elements about it where you're in space, whatever. You're in the space of water, but you're in space. You go there. I think that just being in there. I mean, we play music. We have those... That is an amazing thing when you're in it, especially when you're under duress. Then all of a sudden you have this distraction. I call it task distraction. I call some of these drills are really set up to distract you from how difficult. If you had too much time to think about it, you'd be like, Hey, just stop already. Why would I do this? But you're like, Okay, I got to go here. I got to jump there. They got to remember what the count is. Then you have something playing in the background.

[00:24:22.800] - Speaker 2
It feels good. Something about accomplishing a task. Our brains like connecting the dots.

[00:24:30.440] - Speaker 1
I heard a general give a speech to the graduating class, and he was talking about making your bed in the military. They go, Oh, make your bed. And he goes, The reason why we have you make your bed is because it's task completion. You start by completing something that allows you to go to the next thing and complete it. So I think we are set up to be that.

[00:24:54.460] - Speaker 2
I know two big music stars, both of whom, even went in a hotel, make their own bed every night.

[00:25:00.800] - Speaker 1
Guaranteed. It's not because you want the bed. It's just what it means, what it represents or something about it.

[00:25:06.900] - Speaker 2
It's a ritual, too.

[00:25:08.120] - Speaker 1
It's like that's part of brushing your teeth. I have my rituals, like putting the dishes away in the kitchen in the morning, like It's one of the important things that I do every single day. Every morning, take a shower. I always shower before I go to bed. I can shower an hour before, and then right before I go to sleep, I always go shower.

[00:25:22.820] - Speaker 2
It's just like-Cold shower before sleep?

[00:25:24.670] - Speaker 1
No, hot shower. The reason why... I think part of it is a cold shower jacks me up. I see. I get jacked up from the cold. The cold wires me where the hot shower, if I take it in real hot, then I also I'll go into like a... I'll get colder after.

[00:25:39.770] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:25:40.670] - Speaker 1
Then the airs, everything's colder. When you go out, the bed's colder because that's my biggest sleeping thing is overheating.

[00:25:47.050] - Speaker 2
Do you sleep with a cold bed now or no?

[00:25:48.690] - Speaker 1
I have been, but I think I broke them all. I overheat them now, so I got to get a new one. But yeah, I have a cold pad and I had a cold blanket, but the blanket has stopped working Even though I like that weight, I get used to it.A weighted blanket.I do like that weight. A cold weighted blanket. The problem with a weighted blanket, you get too hot. But if you have a cold weighted blanket, but that's the highest luxury I think you can have.

[00:26:12.600] - Speaker 2
Cold weighted blanket to sleep with. What's interesting about that one, that doesn't mimic nature, a weighted blanket.

[00:26:21.050] - Speaker 1
Maybe it really does.

[00:26:22.290] - Speaker 2
Maybe it's more like childhood being what is called swattling.

[00:26:25.930] - Speaker 1
Well, think about big fur, too. Think about big animal stuff on top of you, stuffing yourself under leaves or whatever. I mean, that's probably where we felt the most safe, too. Because you had some armor over you because we didn't have thin sheets. I think there was probably... We were under animal skins and stuff, with some weight. You got some big animal skin on you. There's some load on that. We didn't have nice down back then. If you're in the tropics, then you have the opposite, right? You have the opposite. You have the opposite. Youwant to...Want to be cool. Trying to cool off. Because we've been that way the longest, right? All those things that we...

[00:27:09.210] - Speaker 2
Without modern comforts. We were wild.

[00:27:12.220] - Speaker 1
For the longest period. Like that, You can't expect, because we had for 200 years or one or two generations, we have DNA that holds information for 14 generations, and you're talking about one or two. The dominant part of is all that other stuff.In.

[00:27:34.320] - Speaker 2
Tune with nature.Exactly. Because if you weren't in tune with nature, you would not survive.

[00:27:38.200] - Speaker 1
That forced everybody actually to have a certain relationship with it. It seems like as soon as we get a little bit away, the further away we get, the more issues we have. Then we go back to it and they're like, Oh, you need to be outside. I had a neighbor, nice lady walk by, and she's like, I really want to go to the next level of my health. I just was like, I think we were loading a dumpster with a bunch of trees I've been cutting in my yard. She's like, I really want to go to the next level of my health. I go, Well, how are you sleeping? How's your hydration? What movement you got? Everybody wants to go to the next level. How about just deal with the foundation? Because if you're not sleeping, you're not hydrating, you're not active. You're not doing these basic core things. There's nowhere to go. There's no supplement. There's no new exercise. Really, there's none of that anyway without this.There's no shortcuts.There's.

[00:28:27.580] - Speaker 2
No shortcut. No. Those could be like bonus, but that's all.

[00:28:31.730] - Speaker 1
Maybe enhance the work that you're doing. Hey, you're going to work harder and you're going to enhance it by using some hack or something like that. But even if you think about heat and ice, all we're doing is simulate riding environments that we were normally in.

[00:28:47.480] - Speaker 2
In some ways, now we're turbocharging it, whereas before, you wouldn't get to experience hot and cold on a daily basis. You'd have to go through seasons. It would take longer.We can condense it.That's right. Do you Is there your first memory of riding a wave as a kid?

[00:29:05.120] - Speaker 1
The truth is that my first experience, shoreline, little tiny kid, probably could barely swim If could swim, if could swim. Waves run up the beach on the sand and hit you and knock you and you roll in and you're playing on the edge of land and sea. I could swim early. My mom said that I was literally crawling to the pool and go in swim, which could have been attributed because the way I was born, my mom had that hair dryer over the stomach that made room for me when I was inside of her. They had a reverse hair dryer that was pulling on the abdomen that created space for me to move. I don't know if there's a relationship with that. I swam early, but I swam. She said I swam. She said it was scary how early I swam. But when I was probably somewhere like three, maybe two and a half or three years old, they took me out on a surfboard, and there was little tiny waves in La Hina on Maui, and they pushed me onto a wave, and I fell off, and it was on a bed of urchins.

[00:30:12.990] - Speaker 1
And so I had both of my butt cheeks completely impaled with urchins as a little... I think I still might have had diapers and stuff. And so that was an early experience. Yeah. I just remember it. Somehow, I got impaled as a young little kid. I think that was the beginning of my, I don't know, just the relationship between the ocean and the severity of it.

[00:30:40.240] - Speaker 2
They had respect for it right away.

[00:30:41.830] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Urchin, respect. But, yeah, so young. I was around the ocean from a little kid, and my mom was a beach lover, beachgoer. My real father was a surfer. My stepdad was a surfer. Or I shouldn't say real. I should say blood, blood father. But yeah, we were beach people. Southern California. Then take me to La Jaina when I'm a little tiny kid. My mom's boyfriend surfed, was surfing every day. So I was just around surfers and surfing in the water.

[00:31:14.360] - Speaker 2
How big was the surf culture globally at that time?

[00:31:18.560] - Speaker 1
Very small. There were people surfing in France and Australia.

[00:31:23.280] - Speaker 2
You would have probably known the names of half of the people surfing?

[00:31:29.940] - Speaker 1
Well, let's just say all the best surfers in the world, there was only a couple handfuls of great surfers, and everybody knew everybody. And surfing itself was the competition aspect of it was almost nonexistent. It was more of a rebel group, a group that was rebelling against Vietnam.

[00:31:52.590] - Speaker 2
Like bikers or something.

[00:31:54.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was the beginning, but it was on the beginning of the first surf apparel companies and then surf competition.

[00:32:01.460] - Speaker 2
Was it like dropping out of society to live a better life on the beach? Was that the idea? Absolutely.

[00:32:06.310] - Speaker 1
My mom's reason to take me to Hawaii as a child was escape the rat race. It was the '60s. It was Woodstock. It was like, Hey, you're going to get the car and get the job and do the thing, or you're just going to rebel against the whole thing. It was like a cultural revolution. Surfing was definitely, at least my parents, they were on the tip of the spear. There was people in the '50s and stuff, too, but the real surge in that culture, in the surf culture, was that.

[00:32:40.340] - Speaker 2
In that, when you were growing up, was it people were riding longboards?

[00:32:43.850] - Speaker 1
It was long Boards, and then the '60s, which was drug, like acid, and board design. I would describe it as just like it was an explosion in It was a crazy, what can we ride? Fiber glass came out, foam came out.

[00:33:05.960] - Speaker 2
Do you remember pre-fiber glass?

[00:33:08.400] - Speaker 1
Well, I can remember. Fiber glass was created way before that. But having foam and fiber glass in the surf industry and being able to start to play with board shapes and do all the stuff that they weren't able to do when they had wood and there was no fins. It was the long board where the first fiber glass boards with foam, and then that allowed the short board revolution. First it was wood boards.I wasn't born yet.That's before your time. I came right when long boards made out of foam and resin to the shortboard revolution.

[00:33:46.400] - Speaker 2
When did the fin get added?

[00:33:48.030] - Speaker 1
It had probably '50s, late '50s, something like that, I would think. Right before I was born, probably. But the fin was pretty primitive. It was-One big fin.

[00:33:57.920] - Speaker 2
It was just one big fin. Had you ever ridden a board without a fin?

[00:34:01.110] - Speaker 1
Yeah.what's that like?Amazing. Yeah, I like boards without fins. They're amazingly fast. Fins actually slow boards down, but they make them controllable. I see. Boards without fins. I mean, that's what all the ancient boards were like... No fin. No fins. Yeah, historically. Yeah, historically no fins. Then fins came out, and that really changed the way because then the boards were…You could aim them. You could aim them, yeah. Actually, it could stay higher in the wave. But the irony is that to ride a board, a finless board, you have to use the edge of the board, which changes the whole way you do it. The ultimate is to have both where you're riding the edge with the fin. That's where we evolved to. But first we had fin and we were using fin, then we went back to using edge. And then the relationship between edge and fin is that's where we are. I mean, now we're at something else because we're We're leaving the water, or we're just writing fin. Now we're just writing fin. And boards are just to have the fin, something to connect to to stand on.

[00:35:09.620] - Speaker 2
Could you imagine something other than a board being the thing that connects to the fin?

[00:35:15.890] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't.

[00:35:17.300] - Speaker 2
I'm just wondering. It's a question mark. It's like the reason the boards look like they do is because of how they interact with the water. If their job stops being to interact with the water, do they need to look like what they look like?

[00:35:30.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah, they do look different now, but they still do have an interaction with the water, so you still have that. For the first part? Yeah. For during, too. If you make a mistake or something, they have to touch and go. But it's a little bit like if you think about the space shuttle and how much different that looks like than an airplane. I mean, it looks like an airplane, but it really doesn't look like an airplane. You're looking at them, you're like, That doesn't look like an airplane. Well, they can't take off. They have to be launched, and then they can fly once they're up to speed and they can land, but they're not great at taking off. That's a little bit of what happens when you don't need a board and you're using a fin, you lose some of the things that you need. You still need to be able to land.

[00:36:17.650] - Speaker 2
When did it go from longboard to shortboard? And what was the difference?

[00:36:23.770] - Speaker 1
When I was real young, there was still a combination of guys riding big longboards that were great. Then there was a shortboard revolution. Then there was everything between, too, which was like these hybrids that were like modern longboards. They weren't like the old tankers.

[00:36:45.470] - Speaker 2
How would you describe the different people between the longboarders and the shortboarders right when the shortboards came out? Who did what and why?

[00:36:54.640] - Speaker 1
Well, I would describe the guys riding the old longboards as more traditional guys. They were just more like lawyers and school teachers and guys that surf, but they were a little more in the mainstream. And then the shortboard guys or the group that was pushing that were a little bit more like the long-haired hippie, like rebelling against society.I'm not going to work in a...Living to surf.Living.

[00:37:24.700] - Speaker 2
To surf.Living.

[00:37:24.760] - Speaker 1
To surf.Living to surf. And more like experimental. Of course, there's always exceptions to every rule. You always have some guys that are... But in general, the group that were a little more on the creative side of it, there was really... I mean, okay, now there's longboarding and shortboarding. This was traditional longboards, the original ones, Before there were short boards, that group still existed. Then you had the new revolutionary design and a different surfing. A big piece of the reason why there was a need for the new equipment was the waves. The waves that they were trying to ride, these old big tankers just couldn't work. A big piece of it was out of necessity. Other than being experimental, a lot of it was based on a need to be able to ride, let's say, pipeline. So you have pipeline, which is-Do you know the story of the first shortboard?

[00:38:23.350] - Speaker 2
Do you know who did it first?

[00:38:25.240] - Speaker 1
I don't. I bet it happened something like guy broke the board, sanded the back end, put a fin on it. It's going to be something like that. I don't think it's going to be so obvious where... Then after somebody's going, Oh, yeah, we could do a short board and make it short. But I think it's going to happen more by accident or maybe out of some young kid doesn't have the money and there's a broken board and he goes and gets a piece of it and retroes a fin on it and patches it and then uses it. It's the most amazing thing he's ever used because you reduced half the drag. All of a sudden, he was freed up and went twice as fast as everybody. They were like, What is that? I think some of it's out of that. I know there's definitely guys that are knowledgeable about it, who exactly did every single. Sam George, for example, just knows every single. He's like, Well, so and so did a such and such a thing. You're like, Okay, here we... But yeah, so for me, I was around all these guys, these men that were playing with it.

[00:39:27.020] - Speaker 1
Because as a young kid, I was at Pipeline, That wave. There was a couple of guys. There was Butch VanArtsdale, who should have been a professional baseball player. He was an incredible lifeguard, but he would still ride his longboard at Pipeline. Because the first guys that went out to Pipeline rode longboards.Yeah.And he could do stuff and pull it off.It.

[00:39:50.030] - Speaker 2
Wasn't the best equipment.Not.

[00:39:51.790] - Speaker 1
Even close.

[00:39:52.750] - Speaker 2
But it's what they were used to, so they could use it in all different situations. That's right.

[00:39:57.460] - Speaker 1
That's right. And he'd pull it off. But when you had Jerry Lopes get a pintail, single fin, and then all of a sudden start playing and toying with the thing where other guys were on a suicidal survival ride, and then the other guys just relaxing, arching, and standing inside of the wave. It was like, that was the difference. But it came out of a need to solve a problem. Hey, we got this issue. The wave is steep and curved and round. The traditional places for longboarding, the longboards were actually probably better for those places. When you look at some place like Waikiki, you can't take a shortboard out there. It doesn't have enough power to push you where the longboard, you could just ride forever. Yeah, yeah.

[00:40:45.610] - Speaker 2
Do you think the maneuvering of the shortboard was inspired by skateboarding, or was skateboarding inspired by the maneuverability the shortboard?

[00:41:02.070] - Speaker 1
Skateboarding, from my understanding, which was surfers without waves. They were like, There's no surf. It's flat. Can't we... What can we do? What can we do? How do we Oh, I got this land sport. It's just going to be just surfing. And so it came from that. Surfing was obviously around because it was... Hawaiian were doing it. The art of riding a wave was there, but it was bored surfers with no surf, you're in Southern California and it's flat for a month and you're like, Hey, what do you want to do? I got these roller skates. Let's gloom to a piece of wood. A lot of what they did early on in skateboarding was try to simulate surfing. They were trying to surf. Then they started to realize, Hey, we can do- Do other stuff. That you can't do in surfing. It's interesting, again, like I said, when you look at how surfing, the long boards you used, or finless boards that you used your edge. Then we got fins, and then we use the and then eventually evolved to using the fin and the edge. You look at snowboarding and skiing, and then how skiing influenced snowboarding because they had the technology of how to build a ski, so then they built a snowboard.

[00:42:11.760] - Speaker 1
But then through the development of snowboards, they figured out this side cut that they put on skis. It's revolutionized skiing. It's like this whole give-back thing. Skateboarding ended up giving back to surfing through the aerial and acrobatic part. Then you had young guys that were good surfers, skating, and they were learning all these tricks because, first of all, it's a little bit like the pool, which is a great environment. It's because it's consistent. You can go there and it's a nice, stable, consistent thing that you can do things that you can't do out in the wild thing. You go to a skateboard park, learn a trick, and then like, Oh, okay, let me try it on a wave. It ends up giving back. It's like you trade and you end up giving Skateboarding comes back in and gives back to surfing. First, skateboarding came from surfing, and then it comes back later and gives back to surfing. You see that a lot.

[00:43:09.890] - Speaker 2
After short boards, was the next revolution in surfing, wind surfing?

[00:43:15.350] - Speaker 1
Well, wakeboarding, too.

[00:43:17.500] - Speaker 2
It was like water skiing, but on a board.

[00:43:19.700] - Speaker 1
That's right. Again, surfers. Yeah.summertime.yeah. Boredom. A lot of boredom involved. Get it behind a boat. They're on a surfboard, they're behind the boat, and then We were riding on... And then we're like, Okay, well, this board's cool, but we don't need all this board. Let's try a little smaller board. And then pretty soon, they're making boards specifically for being behind a boat because you have that power source. Then you don't need It works in lakes.

[00:43:45.670] - Speaker 2
It works.That's right. Yeah.have you ever done it?Yeah.Fun?Yeah..

[00:43:50.070] - Speaker 1
I always liked water skiing because of the speed and the power and the turning. But that also speaks to my choices in the discipline. In surfing, I like big wave riding. It's more like downhill skiing and like racing. It's like downhill.

[00:44:09.870] - Speaker 2
Do you think the main difference is the speed aspect of it? Is that what draws you or is it something else?In big wave running?

[00:44:14.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think that the speed is a reflection of the intensity. I think that big waves and just the energy of the big waves. I think speed is just a byproduct of liking that intensity. Then also for me being raised around, it was what I admired when I watched everything. Again, if you look at the disciplines and you think about acrobatics, you think about skiing and it's acrobatic, that's one discipline. It's more gymnastics, usually going slower. It's not like a downhill course where it's full wide open. I mean, if you crash doing acrobatics, it's severe, too, but it's just not quite like flying into a fence at So big wave riding, you have the smaller wave acrobatic aspect, and then you have big wave riding, which is more like full throttle, wide open.

[00:45:11.050] - Speaker 2
When you were a kid, how often was the opportunity for big wave riding? Even just for you to see it as a kid? A lot.

[00:45:17.880] - Speaker 1
I saw guys like Butch VanArtsdale and Jose Angel and like Warren Harlow. I saw some of... I think the Bull was already gone by then, but I saw that generation, those big wave riders that were still riding giant long boards.The.

[00:45:35.750] - Speaker 2
Very first people to ever do it.Yeah..

[00:45:37.760] - Speaker 1
I mean, maybe I wasn't at the beginning of that, but I was definitely at the end. I saw that.

[00:45:43.350] - Speaker 2
You saw the end of that first phase.

[00:45:44.730] - Speaker 1
I did. Those guys, for me, when I looked at them, they looked to represent what I thought was man.It.

[00:45:52.400] - Speaker 2
Was more inspirational.Like man.

[00:45:55.960] - Speaker 1
I'm like, That's an aspirational. The people below the first group of short boarders, because of my age and where they were at, they seemed more like older brothers. I see. So I looked at them like, Yeah, but it wasn't... The aspiration came from, You see the older brothers, and you're like... And that next group was the ones that really capitalized on the board design and the smaller boards and being able to ride the smaller, more aggressive waves. The other guys would go out when they were calling for a vacuum and stuff, and you'd see the guy going the other way. He'd be like, Oh, who's that? That's Warren. He's going to go swim the sunset. You're like, What?

[00:46:36.480] - Speaker 2
Did you try every new thing when it came out?

[00:46:38.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think part of it was because when I was young... Well, first of all, they didn't even have boogie boards when I was a kid. When I was a kid, there was no such thing as a boogie board. There were broken pieces of surfboards. And as a kidAnd body surfing. Yeah, and body surfing. Maybe you'd steal some photographer's mat, those blow-up mats because blow-up mats were... Anything that... I mean, any object that you could just get your... That could float. That could float. They barely needed to float because they could be on top of them. We used to laugh about McDonald's lunch trays. You go get these lunch trays and you could use those as a hand plane and catch a wave and ride along with it. I was used to that whatever.We.

[00:47:19.630] - Speaker 2
Didn't have anyYeah, trying everything.Trying.

[00:47:21.680] - Speaker 1
Everything.making anything work.Yeah, I didn't have... I remember when my dad, Bill Hamilton, built me a board that I got that I was like... When I I was six or something. I got a board that he made me. I think it was short-lived because usually, you go through stuff fast, especially when you're a destructor. It'd just be like, break, next one, get that. That discourages them, too. When you get the new president, you break it within five minutes. But my openness to be able to... Because of just also what was available. I remember at one point, there was this guy, Bunker Spreckles, who he was impoverished, he used to sleep under the crib in our front yard. Then all of a sudden, one day, he was Clark Gable's stepson, and his Spreckles sugar Aaron. He just all of a sudden went from not a dollar to $100 million. That was 50 years ago. It was at that point, he might as well have been whoever. He just got into like, had guys building prototypes. They were building the weirdest, craziest stuff. Then they would just be… Any rejects would be in the back of the shop, and I could go take I rode the weirdest air vented down rail, weird fin, just the crazy things because first of all, that was available.

[00:48:41.130] - Speaker 1
It was there. I got introduced to all kinds of strange equipment.

[00:48:46.420] - Speaker 2
But that also gives you an opportunity to understand what's possible. That's true. Because otherwise, you think, Oh, a surfboard looks like this.I know what it is.That's right. But when you see people are making all these different things, and you know what works about them or what doesn't work about them, even what doesn't work about them is really helpful to know.

[00:49:03.140] - Speaker 1
Very. Well, because inevitably, there's always something that does work. That just leaves you open for the next thing that comes along. So you're not going, Hey, I only... You're not closed-minded. You're not closed-minded. Listen, I can say I was riding one board, and then one day, some guy showed up, and I was already been surfing for quite a while. I think I was maybe late teens, shows up on the island, and he has this board called thruster, which is a board with three fins. He goes, Oh, you want to try it? I try it. It'd be like all of a sudden, you went from a Model T to you have yourself a new sports car. It literally was just... And he gave it to me. He said, You can have it.

[00:49:53.580] - Speaker 2
Why would three fins make such a difference?

[00:49:56.610] - Speaker 1
Well, because of what it did was that it It reduced the drag, but it put fins on the sides, which allowed the boards and the way they were configured, it was unwading the board and then allowing the board to really be put on an edge where one fin would still stay in. So when you really got laid over and you were on a hard edge, two of the fins would be completely out of the water. And normally, that would just spin out. But one of the fins would stay in the water, which allowed you to be much more You could be so much more aggressive and it would just hold. And so that just totally revolutionized surfing, technically.

[00:50:39.300] - Speaker 2
Do you remember around when that was? What year that was?

[00:50:41.080] - Speaker 1
No. Simon Anderson was the guy. Simon Anderson, an Australian guy, came up with the concept of the... Who knows if it was him and somebody, but he's credited with it. I think he did. It was his brainchild. That would have had to been 30 something years ago. Probably that's how long it's been out, a little bit more. That changed everything everything?Changed everything.

[00:51:01.330] - Speaker 2
Everything changed. The whole thing. The whole thing changed. The whole thing.

[00:51:03.560] - Speaker 1
Every single guy... I mean, right now, we have a four-fin revolution, but it's just in a way, it's an offset of the three-fin. Every professional surfer in the world uses a thruster or a four-fin. Like they're still today. Like I said, when I got on that board and what I was able to do, and then the guy was so nice, he goes, Hey, you can have that board. That was it. From then on, it was like, Put every board away. That's the only board you ride. You had some that you really liked, too. I had all single fins. Jerry Lopez was making a lot of them. They were built for pipeline. Bill Hamilton was building them for me. One thing that I did from early on, because of the nature of my relationship with equipment, was my loyalty to what to the best thing. I wouldn't, just because I was riding, my dad was making me a board, I go, If somebody else comes on with a better board, that's what I'm riding. I'm never going to let the equipment...

[00:51:55.050] - Speaker 2
It would never be a limitation.

[00:51:56.890] - Speaker 1
Never. I'm not going to be compromised it because loyalty to a brand or loyalty to my dad. Because that's the tool. If the tool can allow you to do a better job or do it the way you need to do it or want to do it, that was it. If it was better, it was better. I think that allowed me to bounce along. I always made it clear to whoever I was working with, Hey, listen, if something... I could come back to them and say, Hey, this is what they made, and they could make one that looked like it and see if they could make a better one. But whoever made the best one was the, This is the tool that I use to do this thing that I do. I'm sorry. I'm using whatever one I can. Absolutely.

[00:52:36.650] - Speaker 2
When did wind become a factor?

[00:52:41.660] - Speaker 1
Wind surfing was created and then...

[00:52:46.770] - Speaker 2
'70s? Is this in the '70s?

[00:52:48.130] - Speaker 1
Wind surfing was created in the '70s. But what happened is somebody took a windsurfer and stuck it on a surfboard. Wind surfing was influenced by surfing But they didn't put it on a surfboard. They didn't put it on one that was like people was...

[00:53:04.780] - Speaker 2
They put it on like a little sailboat.

[00:53:06.850] - Speaker 1
That's right. Yeah. Well, there was a board, but it was more like they put it on a board that looked like what the boards looked like in the '50s that they surfed on. It wasn't on surfboards that they were using in the '80s. Then sometime early '80s, they stuck one, and I think it was on Maui. I believe it had to do with Jerry Lopez, Mike Walsh, Matt Zweitzer, some of these guys. Matt, who I know Matt Zweitzer's dad, was one of the co-inventors of windsurfing, the windsurfer itself.The.

[00:53:35.830] - Speaker 2
Original.the original. The original windsurfing was more like sailing on a board.

[00:53:41.230] - Speaker 1
That's right. Even though guys got on waves, and they were surfers, they were influenced by surfing. The sons of the guy, like Matt Schweitzer and my friend Mike Walsh and some of these guys, they took those boards and pulled the keels out and sailed them on the little tiny waves and probably had the epiphany of like, Wow, we can interact with the surf. But when they took the sail off that thing and stuck it on a surfboard, which I think the original one was a Jerry Lopes surfboard for pipeline, then you had yourself a new thing. I was exposed to that at that point. I would say in '85, '84, something like that, mid '80s, I was exposed to that. When I saw that and I saw these guys sailing out and hitting waves and flying, I was like, That is something I want to do. That's a crazy thing.

[00:54:36.610] - Speaker 2
But how many people in the world were doing it at that time?

[00:54:39.380] - Speaker 1
Oh, no. There was companies, right? Because windsurfing itself had regattas, and there was a ton of windsurfers out there. But the core of the guys that were doing it in the surf, in the waves, it was all mostly... I want to say, and there's probably little satellite groups around the world, but Maui was the focus.

[00:54:58.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Also because of the wind. The wind. Maui had the best wind.

[00:55:02.780] - Speaker 1
In the world. One of the best. I mean, okay, there's the gorge in Aruba, but Maui was the... And the wind and the waves. You had that, and you had those guys that were all, like I said, were great wind surfers.They.

[00:55:14.170] - Speaker 2
Were allAnd still today, if you drove in Maui, you find a bunch of windsurfers.

[00:55:18.680] - Speaker 1
But now kiting is in being influenced and now winging. So they have other wind disciplines. But windsurfing today, you still have it. So that's the beginning of that. I get exposed to that. I've been sailing for a year or two, and some guy comes over from Maui. I don't know if he heard about me sailing or heard something, but he came over to meet me. I sailed with him and he said, Hey, you got to come move to Maui. I'll put you on a windsurf team, like a racing team, because they were using windsurfers to break speed records, too. There's a multiple discipline. There's slalom sailing, and you have Robbie Nash, one of the greatest windsurfers of all time from O'ahu, Kailua, which is a great windsurfing place. Not quite Maui. I mean, he ended up moving to Maui just because Maui is a better spot. There's already been that aspect. You already have these disciplines. If a lot of slalom was a big piece of it in the beginning, more like Yachting. It was regatta, like go race around the course in the winter. Then they had freestyle. They had freestyle, which they were doing tricks.

[00:56:22.500] - Speaker 1
They were doing all that stuff on those old big giant, I'd call them dogs.

[00:56:26.620] - Speaker 2
With no waves.

[00:56:27.890] - Speaker 1
With no waves.

[00:56:28.540] - Speaker 2
It was more like boating.Sailing..

[00:56:30.480] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's sailing. Then that whole wave riding thing comes along. Obviously, the guys from Hawaii have a little bit of a lead on it. I ended up moving to Maui because of windsurfing. I was already in my 20s when I started, I saw some girl doing it at a beach where I surf, and I'm like, Let me try that thing. I went out. Wind surfing is actually not that easy. I call it the thousand fall syndrome. You have to go out and you have to fall a thousand times, no matter who you are. You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall, you fall. And all of a sudden, one day you get it and then after that.

[00:57:06.680] - Speaker 2
Did you like that about it, the fact that it was hard to do? Did you like the thousand fall?

[00:57:10.300] - Speaker 1
Let's just say I wasn't discouraged by that. That didn't discourage me. I was like, Yeah, no problem. First of all, and I probably shouldn't be this way, but I see these people doing it, I go, Well, if that guy can do it, and that person can do it, and they can do it, I know I can do it. I can do it. No matter what. I could suck, but I know if they can, I can. Again, it's back to, I've come to learn that's true about everything, that if somebody can do it, somebody else can do it. No matter because sometimes we go, Oh, so and so, but listen, we only have two arms and two legs and two eyes and one brain. At the end of the day, we're not so different that we're going to be able to do something that no one else can do. Now, maybe you can do it first, and maybe you can do it in a way that's different than anybody does it, like music. But you're not the only person that can play a piano. You're not going to be the only person that can play a flute or a guitar or whatever, because sometimes we have a tendency to think, Well, we're going to be the only ones that can do this.

[00:58:09.120] - Speaker 1
No, we're not. If we can, they can. That's all. That's my mentality.

[00:58:17.320] - Speaker 2
I learned from you, first time I came to your gym, I couldn't do one push-up. You said, Don't say you can't do it, say you haven't done it yet. With your help, I worked up to doing 100 push-ups in a row. You You can train to do anything. Just because you can't now doesn't mean you can't. That's true.

[00:58:33.680] - Speaker 1
No, that's true. I think that just speaks to that we create the barriers, right? If you really want to, if you'd be surprised how much different then, Oh, I wouldn't mind being able to do I do that? If you go in with that, I wouldn't mind being able to do that. Genes are, you're probably not going to do it very well. If you're coming in, going like, Man, all I want to do is that. That's the greatest thing. How do I do that? If you have the passion, you'd be surprised what comes. In a way, windsurfing came out of nowhere, brought me to a place, and taught me a bunch of things that actually was the basis for all this other stuff that I ended up doing after, right? The in surfing. It ended up back to what I was saying before, how you do the one thing. You don't think that that has anything to do with this, but all of a sudden that comes back and gives you to the thing that you're the other thing that you do.

[00:59:25.380] - Speaker 2
What would be an example of something that came from windsurfing that benefited did you later?

[00:59:31.710] - Speaker 1
Well, first of all, dealing with the speed. When I got on a big wave, when I finally went the fastest I had ever been on a big wave, that was the fastest I had ever been. When I spent some years windsurfing and speed sailing, all of a sudden, then it was another animal. Then all of a sudden, I was used to going 35, 40 knots across the roughest water you've ever seen. So my reaction time, my speed acclimation, I was another animal. I was another animal. Then footstraps. All of a sudden, now I'm used to being in footstraps. I got a couple of broken ankles to show for it, but I was used to footstraps. Wind surfing made me footstrap friendly. When I put I have my footstraps on my big wave tow board and I got towed in and I'm descending on waves bigger than I'd ever imagine I could ride, all of a sudden, now I'm good with the speed because I'm used to the speed. I'm good with being attached to my board. I know how to use the a footstrap and be in the footstrap. That was just the first other than the influence of equipment, the stuff that went.

[01:00:36.930] - Speaker 1
Because what happens is with windsurfing, when you really go fast, you really find out if your fins work or not. All of a sudden, you're like, Oh, these fins suck.Fings fail.Fail quickly. Then all of a sudden, all that information that you learned about materials, about shapes, about all this stuff that made you go fast on a windsurfer, all of a sudden, you put that into the big wave board, it's a different board. The whole thing's a different animal. Things like that. Things like technique.

[01:01:04.050] - Speaker 2
What about the idea of towing? In a way, the sail is the motor.

[01:01:09.540] - Speaker 1
Well, that was the original influence for towing. Because we were windsurfing, we're out at sea, we sail onto a giant swell, which on a surfboard, you would never even look at that because that would be a mile out from you and you wouldn't be able to catch it because it's not breaking. It wouldn't even be in your brain.Not possible.Not possible.

[01:01:29.850] - Speaker 2
Yeah, Physically not possible.

[01:01:31.300] - Speaker 1
Physically impossible. Not even remotely possible. It doesn't matter who and when and what. Never going to be possible. But you're on a windsurf, you're like, Wow, it'd be amazing to be on this way without this sail because this sail is restrictive. It's cumbersome, it's big, it's affected by the wind. I can only go certain ways and do certain things. I'd love to just be here right now and just throw that sail away and be on my board. When we started towing, when we figured out that you could be towed-It was the very first time you ever towed. First time we ever towed was summer day, north shore of Wauhu, place called V land. We were outside V land, which is on the north shore, and we were freeboarding. We were behind the boat, behind the Zodiac, towing around, summertime bored, but there was a little swell. Let go, being towed. I either was driving the boat and I towed Buzzie or Derek on a wave, or Buzzie was driving and he towed me on. I think I let go, and I went, Oh, I can catch a wave.

[01:02:28.630] - Speaker 2
No one had done this yet. This was a new thing.Not.

[01:02:31.750] - Speaker 1
That we know it.No, of course. Yeah, but people... Because later on after-You weren't copying it. Yeah.

[01:02:35.660] - Speaker 2
At the time you did it, you weren't copying it. No.

[01:02:38.180] - Speaker 1
Never seen it, never thought of it even as a concept.

[01:02:41.920] - Speaker 2
If it wasn't for the sail experience, you might not have thought it.

[01:02:47.500] - Speaker 1
No, because we wouldn't have the desire to go try to get ourselves early on those because we had been on those. We've been going out in stormy, giant surf on the North Shore on our Wind surfers and getting on these swells and just being like, Man, that would be awesome to just not have this sail and just be able to ride this wave in. In the back of your head, you're thinking, Oh, man, it'd be great to not have to need that. But how do we get on the wave without that sail? Then we can throw the sail away and then try to go back and get it.

[01:03:14.670] - Speaker 2
That's not going to happen. How long was it between the windsurfing and towing?Couple.

[01:03:21.070] - Speaker 1
Of winners.Short.Couple of winners. Well, a couple of winters of windsurfing, big wave. Then the summer coming where we got It was all towed on by the Zody, and we thought, Let's try that. Then because we tried it that summer, so that very first swell of the winter, we implemented the toeing and it worked unbelievable. Very first time, let go, fly on the wave. Then after that, it was just like a light went off. From then on, we were just like, Don't even talk to us. It was either sometime in that first window, we had been invited to a big wave event, which was the premier big wave event at Waimeya Bay, the the ICAO, Derek, Doner, and myself were both invitees. They hadn't had the event in seven years because the storms just hadn't been right, the conditions. Those were the winners that we had been windsurfing in giant surf out at sea. We had been riding huge surf, but the event could never happen. We go out, we're towing. The guys came on the jet skis from Waimea and said, Hey, the event's on. You guys got to be down in Waimea. Derek and I looked at each other and we just said, Well, we're not going anywhere.

[01:04:33.880] - Speaker 1
And please put... Derek, yelled, Hey, make sure you put the Hawaiian... Put Hawaiian in. I'm like, Yeah, let's put some people from Hawaii into that event to take our space. And then that was, We never looked back. So they drove away, and we were by ourselves, like two miles out, just going round and round and round.

[01:04:53.650] - Speaker 2
Probably for the seven years leading up to that, you were hoping, maybe they'll do it this year. Hoping. Then when it comes, we got something better going on ourselves.We're good.We're.

[01:05:04.680] - Speaker 1
Doing our own thing.We're.

[01:05:05.880] - Speaker 2
Good.it's.

[01:05:06.560] - Speaker 1
Amazing.we're good.It's an amazing story.We're good.

[01:05:08.800] - Speaker 2
Would it have felt like going backwards?

[01:05:11.790] - Speaker 1
Couldn't. Couldn't even look. Couldn't. I was not even like, what? No, there's no way.Not.

[01:05:17.020] - Speaker 2
Interesting at all.

[01:05:18.110] - Speaker 1
At all. Not even close. What we were doing, that would be like, there's no way. That was his life completely. I had been doing some other stuff, so I was a little bored. For him, it was no For me, it was not even, I'm like, did you see what we're doing right now? I don't know if you... Have you watched?

[01:05:37.370] - Speaker 2
That's a funny story. I don't know if you remember this story, but I have a story. You were out surfing at the Bowl one day, and it wasn't a particularly big day or anything. You were working on some different tricks and stuff, and you did something unusual, and you said to someone in the water, Did you just see that? She thought, Look at what I did. You were looking, my understanding is, you wanted to verify that it happened.Yes.Because you couldn't believe it happened. So if someone else could say, Yeah, it happened, then you know it happened.

[01:06:12.180] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. That's half the reason why you want a friend with you because something's wrong with you. This isn't what you think it is. You didn't do that, or that wasn't what you thought it was. And so in a way, you're just looking for that. That's all the thing. Never is it like, Oh, did you see what I did? Come on. You just want verification that had happened.Verification.Verification. Did I actually do what I think I do? Because it felt like that, but I didn't get to see it because I was doing it. I was like, I didn't look. Listen, when we were kids, when we were younger, that's why we were so enthralled by getting a picture or having something filmed. It was amazing because it was... You never got to reallyIt was proof of concept. Otherwise, you didn't know. You were like, what the... Was it that? How does it feel? Was it as big as I thought? Was I doing what I thought I was doing? Because it felt like I did this and that. But I don't know. So I'd like to see it. And so that's how for us, we started. That's why it was such a great...

[01:07:13.530] - Speaker 1
Oh, my gosh, a guy had a 8-millimetre camera. I mean, it took three months for him to get the... The film back.

[01:07:19.140] - Speaker 2
The film back.

[01:07:20.070] - Speaker 1
And you know what? Some of it was over exposed. But we got... And you were like, Oh, cool. Oh, yeah. Well, that wasn't right. Well, either you were disappointed because you thought it was great, or maybe your mind made it up to be bigger than it actually was.That's.

[01:07:34.250] - Speaker 2
What we used.That's a really interesting idea that we can't really trust our own understanding of things that we experience.Who.

[01:07:43.500] - Speaker 1
Knows?but we do get better at it. I think when you've done it multiple times, then you start to go. If you've done it 10 times, 10 different things, and you had 10 different things, and you get confirmed 10 different times, about the 11th one, you're like, You know what? I don't have verification, but I know that that felt exactly like those last 10 that I did get verified.

[01:08:05.190] - Speaker 2
It's the same with if you film yourself doing it and you watch the film all the time and you get better based on that, you can make corrections. That's true.

[01:08:13.940] - Speaker 1
I remember at one point, my friend said I was doing something with my arms when I was a kid, and I was probably early teens or something like that. I'm like, No, no. He made a comment like, Hey, you're helicoptering. It looks… I'm like, Uh-uh. Then the guy, some guy actually filmed us. Then I saw the thing and I go, Oh, my. I'm doing the thing that he did. You wouldn't know. You wouldn't know.

[01:08:35.920] - Speaker 2
Because it's automatic.Automatic..

[01:08:38.000] - Speaker 1
You don't get to observe it. I told people, I go, When we were young, we were doing it and then we captured it. Now what you're doing is capturing it. When we were young, to have a photo, a nice photograph or a film when we were kids, it was amazing. Now it's a GoPro and everybody's filming every single move. Actually, that's what doing. You're doing is filming. Then it was like, you might get to see the thing in two months if everything goes well and the guy didn't blow it.

[01:09:09.420] - Speaker 2
But in terms of getting better, it's great. In terms of having that feedback, if you want to get good at something, measure it.

[01:09:18.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah, no, it's true. I do believe that there is some value about not knowing, too, and the mystery of it. The mystery might make you less Observe it. Knowing how you look to be like, I'm going to do this because it looks-You feel it more.

[01:09:36.130] - Speaker 2
It's more of an internal experience.

[01:09:38.720] - Speaker 1
Which may actually help the overall evolution. Because I think that, well, that seems more biological. That seems more like how we actually did do it. Okay, you had people observe it and say, Hey, but you weren't observing it yourself. When did we get a mirror? Then when do we get a GoPro and we film every single thing we do and we see all the stuff because some of it I go, Okay, but there is something to the mystery, right? To the mystery of it. Absolutely. You're going off of how it feels to do it when you do it the It may lead to the best. What I say, how it feels the best may lead to you actually doing it the best way.

[01:10:26.430] - Speaker 2
Did you get to see a lot of surf movies growing up?

[01:10:29.220] - Speaker 1
I did. First of all, that was all there was other than you go to the beach and watch surfing. That was the majority of the focus around the industry. There was no world tour. There was no... I mean, there was surfer surfing, but those were magazines, and they were cool. But surf movies were like that was the-That was the industry of surf. That's right. My mom was friends with some of the the better surf They were filmmakers. And then the new generation, obviously, you have Bruce Brown and Endless Summer. Then you had a group of Jim Freeman and MacGillivray and Freeman Films, those two guys. Freeman passed away in a helicopter crash, and then MacGillivray became the most successful IMAX guy after that because he never wanted to make surf films because he lost his partner. But those guys were, in my belief, If those guys really made some of the best-What were some of theirs? Like saltwater wine, Pacific vibrations. I just know the ones that really impacted me, like Five Summer Stories. They had Honk playing. As a kid, you'd go to the theater and big screen and just the whole-What is it about surf movies, though?

[01:11:50.650] - Speaker 2
It's like you can watch them forever.

[01:11:52.360] - Speaker 1
There's so many... Well, the Majesty of the Ocean. It's like I've been blessed with a backdrop of what I do is a giant wave. I mean, if you I didn't have anybody there. You could go down and just watch a giant wave forever. It's like a fire. It's something about that movement and water and just the life of it. I mean, it's just something that's meditative, mesmerizing, entertaining, scary and beautiful. It just has all these emotional things that people go down to the beach and just watch waves break. It's pretty... I mean, if they're big and they're beautiful, where's there to go? For me, I feel like that was the thing that initially drew me to it to the beginning, was just the Majesty of it. Then you start participating in it, and then all of a sudden, you get to be in the painting. Not only are you observing it, now you get to see it up close and see angles and see things that you don't get to see unless you're there.

[01:12:48.760] - Speaker 2
So it's the beauty of it is what drew you in.

[01:12:51.250] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. And the terror. The terror. How important do you think experiencing beauty is for us? I mean, it's like, what does a beautiful woman do to a man? Like, how important. Everything we do is based around that, right? Why do we try to achieve to attract beauty, to do it beautifully, to look at nature, look at a sunrise, look at a sunset, look at creation, look at all the animals, look at the flowers. I mean, it's just-Being in these beautiful places.

[01:13:27.080] - Speaker 2
You live in beautiful places.

[01:13:28.430] - Speaker 1
Beautiful places. By No accident. Very inspiring. Again, I think away from our biology, I think we're meant to be. Part of it is that when you're in a beautiful place and you're looking at something, when you're looking at beauty, you leave yourself behind and you find you don't need anything and you don't want anything and nothing else is important. You're just an observer. It's not about you. It's about what you're observing. In a way, it seems like that's the whole idea behind what meditation and being a monk and all these things is about. It's about you, separating from you and just becoming part of... I mean, listen, a desert is beautiful. A rock mountain is beautiful. The truth is that man makes beautiful things. But when he doesn't try to make beautiful things, then there is no beauty. But nature, you cannot compete with nature. Nothing that man creates is beautiful as Paris and the Louver and Saint Peter, different competition. We go to Yosemite. It's all good. And why is it beautiful to us? That's another question. Why are these things... Why is a desert beautiful to us? Why is a mountain beautiful to us?

[01:14:44.820] - Speaker 1
That's a bigger question.

[01:14:46.360] - Speaker 2
It contains some mystery because that why is like, it is mysterious. That's right. Why do the rocks in Monument Valley have the effect that they do when you see them?

[01:14:56.340] - Speaker 1
I believe that that has to do with because it's a physical representation of God. Because it's a physical reputation of the grand master, of the creator, of grand knowledge, of grand information, of the all-knowing, all... That's what it is. So when you look at it, you're like, Oh, because you say, Oh, you can't see it. I go, You can see it. Have you looked?

[01:15:20.430] - Speaker 2
It's a reminder.

[01:15:21.840] - Speaker 1
It's a reminder that there's something, there's some intelligence, there's some superior design that It, in a way, takes us out of our position of importance. When I'm in the ocean and I'm in some giant surf, I'm not thinking about myself, except maybe when I'm in front of one and it's going to break up my head. I'm like, Wow, I might die right now. But I'm not ever... When I'm in it and in that thing, in a way, I'm not thinking about yesterday. I'm not thinking about tomorrow. I'm not thinking about what I did or didn't I'm just right where I am. I might be thinking about what I need to do to maybe survive, but it's pretty immediate. It's pretty present and immediate.

[01:16:11.930] - Speaker 2
Interesting, you spent so much of your life waiting for big waves I remember one morning in the gym, and you were leaving the next day to go to Chopu, and you were pensive. For someone who's been waiting for something to happen, it wasn't like party time, Here we go, it's happening. You were very serious, very very quiet, and I asked you, What's going to happen when you get there? And you said, I'm going to go out in a little boat, and I'm going to sit with my friend, and we're going to watch the wave, and we're going to watch the wave for about a half hour. Because a half hour is the shortest amount I can watch it and know what I have to do. And then I jump in the water and I go. And I said, Well, why wouldn't you watch the wave for an hour? And you said, If I watched the wave for an hour, I would never get out of the boat.

[01:16:55.310] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Anxiety. I don't want to watch. I I don't want to watch. I want to watch long enough to know what's happening. To know what to do. Yeah. I want to watch.

[01:17:03.690] - Speaker 2
But anything beyond that, and you would get to what could go wrong.

[01:17:07.980] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. You know why? Because I can't do anything about it. I think that's the part. I'm not participating. Then that just was like a self-destructive position. I just get there and grind myself apart and don't. I never have been able to... I'd rather not see it. I'll turn my head and go, Don't show me. Don't let me sit there and watch it. I'll overthink it. There's nothing good that comes out of that. Other than just the initial assessment. Okay, let's understand what the day is so you're not like, Oh, my goodness. I didn't realize that every 10 minutes, a giant wave comes from that place and not that place.

[01:17:42.730] - Speaker 2
The least amount you can know to know what you need to know.That's right.And then take action.That's right.

[01:17:49.700] - Speaker 1
That's right. Yeah. Especially going into environments and situations that you don't have high volumes of experience. When you're going to a spot, you've ridden a thousand times, and the consequences are low and all those things, then it's not even something to think about. But as you get into these situations that you have less exposure to, less volume, and the consequences are higher, and ultimately, you're going to assess as you're in it, too. We always did that, especially in the early days when we were at Jaws on Maui at Piahi, we would always work our way in. We had a few sayings, we We called ourselves the Shoulder Soldiers, where the shoulder of the wave is the safest spot. We would start off and just catch one on the edge and just be like, Okay, let's feel the water. Let's see the thing. No ego, no like, Hey, watch what I could do, and just walk over and get yourself crushed. We had no problem being like... I could see guys go in and just do stuff, and I'd be like, Wow, that's an interesting way to approach it. I could never approach it that way.

[01:18:55.410] - Speaker 1
But that was something we would go about certain things that we did that we-Tell me the story of first seeing Jaws. I heard it from far away, and we had been talking. You heard the crash? I could hear the crash from miles away. Like Piahi, the word Piahi, which is the Hawaiian name for Jaws, means the beacon to be called. So it calls you. You hear... Then you're either drawn to it or you run like...

[01:19:23.400] - Speaker 2
But the sound is different than other way of sound.

[01:19:26.890] - Speaker 1
It's a deep... Sounds like mortar fire in the distance. Sounds like a war. Sounds like, boom. Like, low tone, big power. You can just... Boulders are moving thing. But far away. Far away.

[01:19:42.790] - Speaker 2
Miles away. But the fact that it's miles away and you From here, it tells you something about it.

[01:19:47.570] - Speaker 1
Something large, something severe. It had a reputation on Maui when I moved there for windsurfing. I had moved to Maui being a surfer needing to surf, and then coming to a windy place that the surf was usually pretty messed up. But there was another really good wave on the other side of the island that was a really good wave, but it was just very infrequent, Honolulu Bay, which I would go to and surf to fulfill. If I didn't fly to O'ahu and try to surf pipeline. Maui is a big island. To get surf, you have to drive a lot. A lot of wind, mostly the wind, a lot of the spots are completely destroyed. So you're there to windsurf. Then you hear about this wave. It's not like it's on the road, you just drive down. It's like five, six miles into a pineapple field. You got to know which roads to go on and which places to get to, to even be able to get to a spot where you can actually see it. My friend Jerry Lopez, who built a lot of my boards, who was the king of pipeline, the master of that wave and built my boards.

[01:20:51.120] - Speaker 1
I'd known him since I was a child. He used to let me stay at his house. A mentor? Mentor, yeah. Like an older brother, like an older brother, but definitely crazy good. Crazy, beautiful. Like, make boards for me. Let me stay at his house. Like, very supportive of me my entire life since I was a little kid. His house was at Pipeline, and he lived on my way as well, which was ironic. He was involved with the windsurfers with the first boards, and he windsurfed.

[01:21:21.030] - Speaker 2
I didn't know he was into windsurfing.Into windsurfing.

[01:21:22.700] - Speaker 1
Into windsurfing. Cool. Nice. He tells us about that wave, and he says, Yeah, they call it that. They called it domes. Because there was a dome house, but then that burned down, so they couldn't call it domes anymore. Then they called it the Adam Blaster. But he said that it gets giant. Some people may have paddled out or somebody, but no one surfs it. It's a way that it's there, and it's giant, and it's so rugged. It's so rugged. It's a giant cliff. You have to hike down.Not surfable.Come by boat. Belief.not a surf spot. Maybe you could go and surf it, but it's not a surf spot. It's not a place people surf. Whether they surf it or not is beside the point. It's a little bit towing. Did they tow or not tow? We don't know. But we went there, no one was surfing it. We didn't see anybody surfing it. We saw it dig.

[01:22:07.850] - Speaker 2
What were your first thoughts?

[01:22:09.260] - Speaker 1
How perfect.

[01:22:10.740] - Speaker 2
Doable or not automatically?

[01:22:14.410] - Speaker 1
Not automatic, doable. What a giant perfect wave.Oh, I see.Don't know if it can be ridden.Right. I think we saw it. I don't know if we already were towing, but there was a correlation between we had already been towing and we saw it.

[01:22:31.380] - Speaker 2
Had you never seen a wave ridden that looked like that?

[01:22:35.150] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:22:36.240] - Speaker 2
And nowhere in the world?

[01:22:37.440] - Speaker 1
Not even close to. I mean, there was giant waves that were ridden. Yeah. Maybe in cartoons.

[01:22:41.930] - Speaker 2
But not like this.

[01:22:43.540] - Speaker 1
Only in those surf movies when I was a kid. Yes. Because they had cartoons in the surf movies with little tiny guys riding giant waves.

[01:22:50.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it was like that.

[01:22:51.850] - Speaker 1
Like that.

[01:22:52.370] - Speaker 2
Okay. Cartoon wave.

[01:22:53.700] - Speaker 1
Cartoon. Yeah. Full cartoon. And that was cartoon wave from two miles away on a cliff, never mind throw somebody out there and see that they look more like a mosquito than they do like somebody to ride the wave. Like, beyond. Like, just not in the game of what people you do. I mean, why? I mean, as giant, it's a beautiful wave. Sunset Beach, okay. You Greg Newell rode Macaha 1969, but this is a different thing. This is just a different creature. You could just see the way, the speed of the wave, the shape of the wave.Different.

[01:23:23.910] - Speaker 2
Magnitude, different?More.

[01:23:25.840] - Speaker 1
Than the next step. More than the next step. Not a big day at a good spot. No. Just a whole different animal. Whole different animal. This is the speed and just the whole setup on a cliff, where it is, how it is. It's like everything about it makes it look like... That's not exactly an imitation. There's not like a sand beach in front where you can go down there and stand and go like, Hey, maybe I'll paddle out. There's no sand anywhere in sight for miles. Sand is like, Boulder Beach. That's all the sand there is. Boulder Beach on a cliff in front of a thing.

[01:23:57.680] - Speaker 2
If you're lucky enough to make it back land.

[01:24:01.060] - Speaker 1
You might not make it back up the cliff. Definitely not with everything intact. You'll be broken, bored, whatever. We see it, and I'm living with... I have a friend, Mike Walsh, who's best friend. His dad invented windsurfing. He's a phenomenal windsurfer, and it's just a stud of a guy I work with. He's just a great friend, and he had been windsurfing. We had all heard about at the same time, and I'm not sure the time frame, but sometime in that same winter or within the winters, they windsurfed up from Hukipa, which was about six miles away. They tacked their way up to the spot, and they either got on a wave or got a couple of waves or something like that, and then they went back home. Then that was like, Okay, wow, we could go there and do that, but you had to tack six miles. If something breaks, you're done because it's all cliff all the way back. There's nothing about it that made it like something that you'd be reoccurring. I was able to, on a small day because now I was interested. Now we were like, Hey, we're interested. Let's see it.

[01:25:10.140] - Speaker 1
Let's go look. Every time the surf's big, we'll go down there and see what the swell is doing. We're starting to become interested in just observing the spot. Conditions are beautiful. On one day, small, I took my board, walked down the cliff, paddled out, caught a couple of waves, small waves, but just to experience the whole thing.Proceed slowly, observe Step by step. Step by step. Take your time. Things been here a long time, probably going to be here after we're gone. Go do that and then catch a couple of waves. I think that was even before towing or toeing just happened right within that same time. But we're doing tow in on a wahu. We're not even on the island, and we don't have the equipment there. But we do tow in, and then we're like, and we've been doing tow in for a little while on wahu. We're like, Oh, yeah, okay. Now we to go bring this tow in to go to this spot. Because then we come by boat. Initially, tow in, it was pre-jet ski. We didn't have that. I think there was one model of jet ski out. We didn't have them.

[01:26:10.860] - Speaker 1
We used Zodiacs, which were a lot more cumbersome. That was the initial thing that we were using, which means that you had to be ready to drive a Zodiac with an outboard motor in front of a giant wave. Try to pick your friend up without running him over. Try not to flip over when you go over the top. We just had a bunch of things that Zodiacs were not the ideal machine.Not close.No, but closer than nothing.Yes.MuchYes.

[01:26:35.860] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes.

[01:26:37.500] - Speaker 1
Closer than nothing, but not ideal. Then we bring the boat there. Then I think I get approached by... Because We're starting to tow, and they hear, and I get approached by Bruce Brown, Endless Summer. And he's doing Endless Summer, too.Wow.And he says, Heard you doing this thing called tow in, what's the thing? I go, Well, my fee is a brand-new jet ski. Perfect. They go great. Perfect. Here's our first machine. We get our very first machine. We have that at Jaws.

[01:27:09.830] - Speaker 2
After the test run, do you ever go on smaller days before bigger days?

[01:27:15.260] - Speaker 1
To understand that. I think we go there early, and it's big. On a day where we're going there and we're scared. We're scared. We don't know if we're going to die.

[01:27:27.920] - Speaker 2
When you're going there, is there any version How many of you are going there and deciding not to do it? Could that happen?

[01:27:35.190] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. In fact, we're going there with the... We're not sure if we can do it.

[01:27:41.620] - Speaker 2
We're not sure if we-You're going there with a question.

[01:27:43.100] - Speaker 1
That's right.

[01:27:43.880] - Speaker 2
We want to answer the question.Answer.

[01:27:45.580] - Speaker 1
The question. We definitely aren't going there. We're going to. Because we don't know what we're going to do. We have no idea how our equipment is going to work. We have no flotations, and we don't know what's going to happen on that We don't know if our boards are going to work. We don't know if the things are going to... We don't know any of it. We're just completely coming in like explorers. We're coming in like, Okay, am I going to fall off the edge of the world? Am I going to just disappear and then into the abyss and never come up? How many people in the crew? Well, the original crew was Buzzie and Derek and I. That was the three of us. We were the three on the north shore of O'ahu. But once I came to Maui, I had my boys over, the group of guys. I had Mike Walsh, who was the windsurf phenomenon.

[01:28:33.110] - Speaker 2
But on the day that you went, there were three of you in the water?

[01:28:36.040] - Speaker 1
I think the very first time, I think we went with one boat, and there was probably three of us. I don't know if it was Derek and Buzzie and I or if it was Buzzie Then we started pulling guys in. We had Brett, Lickle. We had Dave Kalama. We started, and I don't know-You still only had one ski. Yeah, but we had a Zodiac, too.

[01:28:58.150] - Speaker 2
You go out with both. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:29:00.300] - Speaker 1
I see. Yeah. Well, because we had the mama ship that we would run with as well. The one thing about the one little caveat that we had at that place is that that's also on the windiest place in the world. We're on the wind factory. Now we have wind as a big element that we never had on the north shore of O'ahu because the wind is just not the same there. You come there, and now we have the wind element because this is a wind factory combined with the giant wave, which makes It makes it a whole another animal.

[01:29:31.850] - Speaker 2
When you're going fast on the board, for someone who hasn't done it, what are the things that you wouldn't expect?

[01:29:39.740] - Speaker 1
Well, first of all, how much you feel the surface. If there's any bump or anything like how you're going to fly out of the water.

[01:29:47.510] - Speaker 2
Because it's a storm.Yeah. You're in a storm, essentially.

[01:29:50.830] - Speaker 1
The faster you go, the bigger a small bump is. If you're going slow, bumps aren't even an issue. But when you go fast, little bumps It's become big bumps. Speed increases the roughness, and then also how difficult it is to turn when you're going fast. Then where do you turn? You have a giant wave, and it's like, where do you turn? If you go to the bottom of the wave, You're going to be destroyed. You have to turn on the face of the wave. There's some things happening that are like they do on little ways. It's just everything's big, magnified. All those things are exaggerated, but definitely-The bumpy part is interesting because I think of a wave being so smooth, like sliding down a slide. When it is, it's beautiful. When it does it like that, no. In fact, it's like sliding down. It slide with a bunch of rocks on it.

[01:30:43.100] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:30:44.440] - Speaker 1
Now you go to Chopu, in Tahiti, and that thing is... It stretches the bumps out. So you have a different animal. But Piahi, Nazare, Mavericks, these other bigger... Bumpy. Bumpy. Bumpy, even when they're smooth. At certain days, they're smoother because speed also makes smooth rough. The faster you go, it's like if you go slow down a bumpy road, you follow the terrain. You go fast on a bumpy road, pretty soon you're getting there. You're flying. I always use the analogy of downhill skiing when you see guys that if you go slow down a downhill course, you never leave the ground. You come down on the downhill course at 60 or 80, you hit a null, all of a sudden, You're in the air flying. That's a big piece of it, too, is being able to control that as you're going and then set a turn and do a whole thing that there's a whole art to that. That probably becomes one of the biggest challenges in riding a wave is dealing with the texture of the face. That's why we have arrived with foils, because you're not affected by that texture. It has its other own its issues, but now you're not completely at the mercy of the texture.

[01:31:59.490] - Speaker 2
Okay, so now you've gone to Jaws a few times. Then what's the first time where it's like ridiculously big?

[01:32:06.980] - Speaker 1
Probably that first season. Yeah. I mean, it got ridiculously big quick because it was already ridiculous big when it was small. It was already ridiculously big when it was small.

[01:32:16.500] - Speaker 2
Before it was ridiculously big, would it have been the biggest waves you had ridden?

[01:32:22.780] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:32:24.010] - Speaker 2
It was already bigger than anything you rode, and it hadn't yet.

[01:32:27.240] - Speaker 1
But I had towed in on the north shore of O'ahu, so I had ridden some big waves there. I had also ridden some bigBut not as big as this and not with wind. Exactly. And not this velocity, just the speed of this wave and the way the wave broke. It broke like a very aggressive little wave. But now it's big because a lot of the bigger waves get in deeper water and they just move slower. They just have a different... I mean, they always move faster the bigger they are. But a lot of the ones that break in deeper water just have a different movement to them. This was acting like a It was a small, aggressive wave, but it was giant. Then you had that combination that really made it a lot more challenging.

[01:33:07.120] - Speaker 2
How much do waves change over time?

[01:33:09.390] - Speaker 1
What changes is the generation of the swell, where the swell angles are coming from, which makes the wave completely different. If your predominant swell direction was northwest, and then all of a sudden, you don't have northwest, you have north, all of a sudden, it's a different wave, completely different wave. Or you have completely straight west, completely different wave. We have all those angles. When we go through season, sometimes you'll see that the predominant storm production angle completely changes. Normally, where they'd be coming out of the Northwest, all of a sudden, they're Super West, or they're more out of the North. That makes the wave completely different. The bottom topography and that stuff doesn't change at all unless a place like pipeline where the sand moves and comes in and fills in and does stuff.

[01:33:55.760] - Speaker 2
Did that happen in pipeline?

[01:33:57.020] - Speaker 1
The sand moves a lot there. I see. Once the all goes away and it's back to the reef, then no, the reef is exactly the same. That bottom is not changing. That bottom is going to be like that for another hundreds, thousands of years. But swell angles and where the storms are being generated because of the way the weather patterns are, that's what changes all the time. There are certain predominant angles that have evolved, where that most of the storms-Predominant angles have shifted over time? It seems that way.Wow, that's interesting.ItIt seems that way.That's interesting. Because I imagine that they're always shifting. But I do believe-For the amount of time that we've been watching it, it's shifting. Well, for example, this last season, we had a very uncharacteristic swell pattern that came through for three weeks. That was a severe West swell angle. The last time we saw anything remotely like that was in the '80s, where we had West winds for weeks on end with this severe West angle. We haven't had that condition since the '80s. Somebody else said, Oh, yeah, I haven't seen that since the '80s. I was like, Yeah, that's true.

[01:35:08.030] - Speaker 2
Fifty years.

[01:35:09.350] - Speaker 1
Exactly. We don't know those patterns because those patterns for us, those things are like, That could be a week ago. That was a week ago. It changed. But we're thinking, Wow, that's been in my lifetime. But we were fortunate when we were writing Piahi at the beginning, writing Jaws for that first 10-12 years. That window of time, if you go back archivally and look at that, and I'm not saying that just because we were writing it and all that, I'm saying that the amount of big surf that happened, we haven't seen that since then. In the last 20 something years, we have not even remotely seen that volume of big surf per winter. Now we're seeing a couple of swells. There was like every week, every other week, it was literally like a machine. Those things happen. We don't know what... I mean, temperature. There's just There's so many variables, the jet stream, there's all these things. All of that stuff is a mystery. I think that's part of the fascination also, too. But that also affects the waiting, affects the anticipation, the disappointment. This season, for example, they were forecasting a powerful El Niño.

[01:36:20.000] - Speaker 1
For us, that means lots of giant surf. Three force wells done, shut off January 15th, turned off like a light switch, like nothing, zero, gone. We're What happened to Powerful El Niño? That's with all the expert forecasters, with Archival. We're just shooting in the dark when it comes to that.

[01:36:38.100] - Speaker 2
We know very little.

[01:36:39.700] - Speaker 1
If that. We know very little. Especially when it comes to that stuff, when it comes to the behavior of the patterns of, I would say, the emotions of our Earth, I think that's part of the mystery. That's part of the fascination. That's part of the allure. That's part of when you get something special, you'll never get it again like that.

[01:37:00.410] - Speaker 2
With something like Jaws, you have that experience. Finally, you get to ride it when it's crazy big, you get to do it a lot. Is there a time when it's like, Okay, I've done that?

[01:37:10.530] - Speaker 1
That happened once the settlers came, or should I say, once the people came and started putting pressure on the spot, I got distracted from it and started being concerned about what people were doing and endangering themselves, endangering other people.

[01:37:30.170] - Speaker 2
You understood how dangerous it was. People saw you do it and then think, Oh, if he could do it, I'll do it.

[01:37:36.900] - Speaker 1
Yeah, which is true.

[01:37:37.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but it wasn't always true. It didn't necessarily have to be true for you. No. Who knows? We don't know. We don't know.

[01:37:45.140] - Speaker 1
When it stops being fun, what is it that made it stop being fun? I could say, Well, everybody coming. That could be part of it. Maybe I couldn't get any more out of it that I was trying to get out of it with the consequences.

[01:37:58.030] - Speaker 2
Once you've done it, there could be some point of like, I did this a bunch of times.

[01:38:01.580] - Speaker 1
The only thing I didn't do was really do something stupid. I mean, I shouldn't say that I did a lot of stupid things. I've done more than one. But I could say, But part of it's that, too. Maybe the only thing you hadn't done is just have more bad shit happen. The truth is, what happened was... Well, first of all, we were filming everything we were doing by the end, and that stopped being fun. It became every time there was a giant swell. Did you feel like work or something? It just stopped because I was... Distracted. Do we have the boat, guys? Do we have the thing? Do you get the camera in there? Do the cameraman got the thing? Okay, we got the boat. All of that stuff, and all I want to do is surf. But then I'm trying to organize myself. And then everything you're doing is being documented, and it's part of, okay, it's for your work, it's for this. It's the whole thing. So then I say, and again, be careful. My mom used to say, be careful what you ask for, the way God punishes you, does he give you what you ask for?

[01:38:53.470] - Speaker 1
But I said, you know what? It'd be nice to have a special day, undocumented, lead to an unforecasted as well, storm generation uncharacteristically close to the island chain in a position that normally they don't go. So the forecasts are inefficient because they're used to forecasting from a spot and tell you the whole thing. So they don't really have a forecast for it. We start, Jaws is out of control, bad angle, and the energy is completely just making Jaws terrible because the angle that the swell is coming from is making it completely just terrible. But making another place off of the airport down by Sprecklesville as good as it could ever be. So we go there. To this day, I still... I don't think we've ever ridden or seen anything bigger to this day. No cameras. A couple of miles offshore.Giant shore break.Yeah. Ifr, which means no helicopter We had a helicopter friend. My friend Dawn was going to fly and see. My friend Dave Kalama, who's my tow partner, had a hurt ankle or injured, so he couldn't come with me. Convinced these other guys to come out with me, Brett and John Denny and Sierra Emory, who since drove off a cliff on purpose, but convinced them to come out with me.

[01:40:21.150] - Speaker 1
It was as big as we've ever seen, ever, anything. My friend Brett was injured to the point where I had to tournicate his leg my wetsuit and give his flotation, swim naked, get the jet ski, get him, call the ambulance, crash land on the beach naked in front of a bunch of people, put him in an ambulance, and then I went back out again. That's when I realized. But the truth is, I realized that on that day, at that point, that there was a limitation to our boards, that the boards themselves were not going to allow the technique of being towed in with a board. Once it got to this next Next thing, which we might not see in my lifetime, we may or may not, you couldn't descend.

[01:41:06.720] - Speaker 2
You got past the point of where the equipment could hold up under the conditions.

[01:41:11.380] - Speaker 1
Yes. That changed my life forever. At that point, I was like, This thing over there is bullshit. I don't mean bullshit, but I meant like I'm-Yeah, you had an epiphany.

[01:41:24.350] - Speaker 2
There's some new thing to do.

[01:41:25.710] - Speaker 1
Well, and also I realized that if it really does do some That's the thing that I'm waiting my whole life to do as this guy's pursuing, trying to ride giant surf, I'm not going to be able to do it with these things. So I need to figure out what it is, which we had already been playing with the foils.

[01:41:40.360] - Speaker 2
What was your first time you ever saw anything on them?

[01:41:42.600] - Speaker 1
Well, the first time I probably planted the seed, I rode on a giant hydrofoil boat, inner island in Hawaii called Sea Flight. It was a boat that had big turbines on it, and it lifted up on hydrofoils and flew across the water, and I I wrote on it as a child. It was called sea flight. As a child, fly on this thing. The thing somewhere back deep in my brain was this seed. Then cut to, again, summertime boredom. My friend Brett goes, Hey, there's a thing. This guy's got this hydrofoil device in his garage up in Pukealani on Maui. It's a seat or something. I go, Well, can you get it? He goes, Yeah, let The guy goes, Sure. So he let us borrow it. So we took it.

[01:42:35.060] - Speaker 2
Did it have a chair or something?

[01:42:36.440] - Speaker 1
Chair. You sit down and you strap. I thought it was for handicap. I thought it was a handicap device. I go, It's for handicap. But it wasn't. It was the way the thing was set up. You strapped yourself to a seat, and I called it the scared chair, and then you'd just get pummled. You'd fly along and we'd smash our face. I'm like, We're surfers.

[01:42:51.720] - Speaker 2
So the very first-Would you get towed?

[01:42:53.680] - Speaker 1
Toed behind the boat, behind our seat.

[01:42:55.950] - Speaker 2
It'd be like water skiing, except you're sitting in the chair and you're floating aboveup in the water. Yeah.on a stilt.On a stilt.

[01:43:02.340] - Speaker 1
Like a stilt. Yep, on a foil. Yeah. On a foil, on a stilt, you're sitting on. The guys who can do it, do it well. They can do back flips, and they ride along behind the boat and do a bunch of crazy stuff. What's the name of that? The original one was called an air chair. Air chair. The air chair. It was called the air chair. It came originally from a set of water skis that somebody had designed that had a foil on it from the '50s or '40s because hydrofoils had been around militarily and also in in the water world for a long time. Got that, that first day, I'm like, Well, we don't sit down. We sat down three times, smashed our face, and then we started trying to stand on it. We got undid ourselves off the chair and then stuck our feet in the thing and stood behind the chair and got up and went 10 feet standing and we're like, We can stand on this thing. Guaranteed.so we asked...Just.

[01:43:57.730] - Speaker 2
So I know, you think there were thousands of air chairs in the world?

[01:44:02.230] - Speaker 1
Millions? Hundreds, maybe. I don't know how many he made at that time.

[01:44:07.000] - Speaker 2
There weren't thousands. It was one guy who had an idea and made a hobby thing.

[01:44:11.380] - Speaker 1
But he was selling them. He was selling them to people and convincing them people to ride them, and people were riding them. At that point, I don't know how many he had sold, but there weren't tons of it. This one was sitting in a garage that had spiderwebs on it. The guy had bought it and didn't, wrote it once and never used it. We were like, Get that thing. I said, Ask this guy if we can borrow it and we won't hurt it, but we're going to try to modify it. The guy said, Okay, cool, but you can't hurt it. We're like, Okay. We took the foil out of it and...

[01:44:44.680] - Speaker 2
Did it unscrew?

[01:44:45.940] - Speaker 1
How did itIt had an insert, so it came up in the chair. The top of the foil shoved up into the seat and had a screw between the seat and the top, screwed it down to hold the thing in a slot. We undid the screw, we popped the thing out, I'm like, Okay, now we have to figure out how to make a board that we can make a slot. We took a wakeboard and we made a plywood pyramid out of multiple layers of plywood that we made a slot out of. We shoved the thing up there and screwed the thing into it. Then we mounted stiff snowboard boots in the front and back because we figured the chair offered leverage against the foil. We needed leverage. The only way we could do that is take our ankles out of it because our ankles were too supple. We had snowboard boots in binding. Again, back to you go snowboarding, you think it doesn't have anything to do, and then it comes, it brings you back. We boot in, we clip on, and we could stand on it and we could fly behind the boat. We're jamming around, standing on a foil.

[01:45:47.080] - Speaker 1
As soon as you stand up and you feel it, you're like, Oh, okay. This sensation is beyond amazing.

[01:45:56.540] - Speaker 2
How long ago was this?

[01:45:58.100] - Speaker 1
How long ago was that? Probably right around same time, late '80s, early '90s, early '90s.A long time.Yeah. Yeah, early '90s.

[01:46:06.450] - Speaker 2
I didn't realize you've been messing around with foils that long. That long, yeah.

[01:46:09.860] - Speaker 1
Early '90s, I would say a long time. We've been playing with foils for more than 20 years. So did that, rode it. We're having fun. It was cool, flat water. Then we went and we were tired of driving to the other side of the island when the water was flat. So we went and we went to where there was surf. We started towing around. Then, like towing, all of a sudden, let go and fly along and all of a sudden, ride in the wave's energy with the foil. We realized that you could tap into the energy of the wave with the foil.

[01:46:42.120] - Speaker 2
Which you'd have no way of knowing because up until now, you've always been on the surface. Always. The relationship between the board on the surface.

[01:46:51.440] - Speaker 1
Gravity.

[01:46:52.410] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So your board's not touching the water, you can't surf.

[01:46:56.730] - Speaker 1
That's right. You just don't know how would the thing underwater cutting along, how would the fin underwater be able to be pulled by the wave's energy? How would that even-How would you know? You wouldn't know, but we knew quick. As soon as you let go and you went like that, we went, Oh, my. We can ride away with it. Then once we did that, we had, like I said, Dave Kalama, Mike Walsh, Russ Randall, Mark Angula. I had a good group of guys that were excited because we had a little core group, and you get excited. It's like a band. You're like, Cool, man. That song, yeah, okay. Then we get hyped up and we meet each other at the beach. I remember at one point we were all learning how to do front flips on Wind Surfers. Somebody said, We heard about some guy did one by accent or something, and then we're like, Oh, you can do a front flip. So we went down. I think my record was eight boards in a day, broke eight boards in half in a day. I think our other buddy broke eight and six. We were breaking boards, but we had that thing going with each other.

[01:47:53.750] - Speaker 1
Everybody got hyped up, started buying the foils from the chair guy. First of all, I called the chair guy up and I go, Hey, listen, we're standing on these things. They're amazing. He goes, If you are, we're going to sue you. He goes, Liability. Somebody's going to break their neck. I go, Okay, whatever. We had people go online and buy the parts and stuff, and then we would make... Then we started building boards specifically to hold the foils. We started chopping the tops off and welding plates on and making all these prototypes. I mean, everything was a prototype. One of the big breakthroughs we have is Kalama's uncle or somebody had a naval engineer, and he created this one wing out of G10 that we could bolt to our existing fuselages, and that changed the way our rigs rode. We could handle the speed.

[01:48:39.480] - Speaker 2
How different is getting towed versus riding a wave?

[01:48:44.610] - Speaker 1
When you're being towed, the water is neutral 99% of the time. Even if there's a little wind blowing or whatever. You're flying through neutral environment. When you're riding a wave, you're harnessing the energy of a wave, which is energy going through the water. The amount of pressure that's on the wings and the foil and how it's affecting the thing is much greater. You can get away with stuff on flat water, toeing that you can't. There's other things, too, you You need things like you need to be able to slow down without stalling. You need a lower stall speed. We're like, behind a boat, you can keep the boat's going 24. Okay, go 24. Stay at 24. Where you're going to be on a wave and you're going to go 35 and you're going to go 15. You need this bigger range of-What is the equipment that you need to be able to do that to control the stall speed? You need better shapes, better shaped foils, better wings, wings that fly that have better lift ratios, like an airplane. You need certain airplanes, if they get below a certain... If the wing isn't big enough and the shape isn't right, they get below 150 knots.

[01:49:56.830] - Speaker 1
No, that's going to fall out of the sky.

[01:49:58.150] - Speaker 2
You've tried a bunch of different shapes?

[01:50:00.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, we kept trying a bunch of shit and trying things that we like and trying sizes, sizes, shapes.

[01:50:06.240] - Speaker 2
Any surprises along the way? Where something works that you didn't think would work or would find something? What were some of the breakthroughs along the way?

[01:50:14.660] - Speaker 1
The height of the strut. The height of the strut was a big... That was a big factor because that increased the sweet spot. It'd be like a-Higher is better or worse? Higher is better. Really? Even though you get to a point of diminishing return. I see. Which is it becomes too much leverage. Then you get too much leverage, which isn't great. But it's like a big tennis racket where you have a bigger sweet spot. Imagine if your board doesn't touch and the foil doesn't come out of the water, that's great. But if you have a short strut, which is the piece between the two, then the board can touch soon or the foil will come out. Neither one of those are a disaster. Technically, I describe it like travel a vehicle. It has bigger travel. When you go to the Baja 1,000, the guys have 48 inches of travel. It means you can drive through a 48-inch pothole and not bottom out. It's the same thing where when you have that bigger mast, you can go to the And especially when you're going down bigger surf and you're going fast. So we started to play with all of that position, foil shape.Was.

[01:51:22.020] - Speaker 2
Anyone else in the world doing this?No.Yeah. And I imagine if anyone saw what you were doing, they would just think they're crazy.They did.

[01:51:28.330] - Speaker 1
They thought we were crazy. And on top of it, we were crazy because we're booted in. We had snowboard boots on. So you imagine... And that was another thing that affected my pool training and stuff, too, because I had a situation where I got... I was with a friend, and we were way offshore by ourselves, and A giant wave hit me and drove me with my rig. My foil rig was heavy way down into the darkness, and I was attached to a sea anchor with boots on, for real. You know that old cement boots? Yeah. This was the real cement boot. I was at the bottom of the ocean connected to the board with my boots on in the darkness, and I was thinking, This is a problem. This is a real... This could be it. I reached down and got the... I had quick releases, so we weren't completely flying by the seat of our pants. I got released, but I still had boots on, and I still had to get to the top. You don't swim well with boots. No. What I did was, as I didn't use my legs at all because the boots don't work, and I just used my arms.

[01:52:31.500] - Speaker 1
But through that process, I learned that you use a lot less oxygen with your arms. And so my breath hold time expanded. So I had more-Because you weren't using your legs to swim to the top.

[01:52:45.500] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:52:45.880] - Speaker 1
So came up, got it, had the whole... But so there were some things like that. I had that revelation about it foiling, started to foil, lost the interest at going to Piahi because it was getting so much attention and it had so much draw to it. Then after that, I just completely focused every single winter foiling in all the biggest surf we could, our whole thing. We didn't even think about small waves. We were only towing in giant surf foiling. That was our whole use of it. Foiling through the exposure of stuff that we're doing all of a sudden starts to get some traction. I had done this early on when we foiled, because I was involved in kiting, because I was involved in windsurfing. We were amongst the first 5 or 10 guys in the world to kite. I was in a core group of guys.

[01:53:35.900] - Speaker 2
Kite surfing is where you're on the board and there's a sail up in the air?

[01:53:39.560] - Speaker 1
With a string, and there's a kite in the distance. We were early on, the stuff we were doing. First, we did it on land, and I ended up getting pulled up into some high tension wires and fell from the sky, broke my ankle. I'm like, Yeah, we can't do this on land. We got to do this on the ocean. Then we would do stuff like, You'd be on your board in the water with your board. The boards that really helped us launch that whole thing. It changed into wakeboarding for our big wave boards because they went fast, they had foot straps, so they were perfect. The guy would be on the beach with the kite, you'd be in the water, and then he'd launch it. And then literally, it would be like there's a rope on a bull, and they open the gate, and you're holding on to the rope on the bull. If you let go, the bull runs away, or if you crash, you're done. That was how it was. We would go down the Coast on Maui from the Hukipa and just do a death run and then end up at the airport.

[01:54:35.950] - Speaker 1
If you didn't crash somewhere along the way, out at sea, hopefully not because you'd be way offshore and that's never fun. The kites didn't relaunch. They were literally, if they hit the water, there was over. We had to keep the kite in the air, not crash, and just hold on for your life. That was early kiting in the initial stages of it. In that, as we started to kite, we were foiling, too. We were kite foiling. They were air RAMs initially, which are the ones that guys jump off the mountain with that the air goes in and makes the shape. They weren't relaunchable yet. We had heard about a guy in France who had built the relaunchable ones, the blow-up ones. I knew a French guy, and I said, Hey, when you go there, bring those kites back. Because he was making them for some blow-up catamaran or some crappy thing. I'm like, relaunchable kite? Get that thing. I married the foiling with the kite initially, and I kite for it, and I go, You know what? This is going to be a discipline, no doubt. But I'm not that interested in it. I want to ride waves.

[01:55:29.610] - Speaker 1
I'm a surfer, and that's my front. But it's going to be its own thing. Come to, we're riding all winter, toeing in every time there's a big swell, working on riding giant waves with foils, come to foiling's birth in kiting, explodes. The guys are kiting, foiling, all of a sudden, breaking world records, stuff like that. But foiling all starts in kiting. Then that's when the first foil companies, where they have money for R&D and they're paying guys because they're selling production stuff, and they're doing the whole thing. They're running business. They have clients. That starts that part of the industry, of the foil industry, which ends up influencing small wave foiling. Normally, what happens is you start in the small waves and you go small, medium, large. You get the big waves. We were in the big waves because we were... In a way, we went...

[01:56:24.580] - Speaker 2
The only reason you were on the foil was to manage the giant wave because The regular surfboard couldn't do it anymore.

[01:56:32.640] - Speaker 1
Yes. The irony is that it can ride a wave that you couldn't even surf it so small.

[01:56:38.720] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[01:56:39.630] - Speaker 1
That's the irony. In the pursuit of the fastest, roughest, biggest that you could do is that the result is that same instrument is the one that can ride a wave that doesn't even break. Then you could ride wind swells, and you could ride little tiny waves that don't break for miles. It just expanded. All of a sudden, this whole universe just expands, and you have companies starting kiting from kiting that move into... Now you have winging, which is kiting without strings. So now you're just holding the kite right next to you on a foil board. Because the foils are so-Have you tried that?

[01:57:13.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah. What's that like? Fun?

[01:57:15.830] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Coming from windsurfing and kiting, it's a little... I've seen some... I saw the world champion in Chukama because we go to Peru for one of the longest waves in the world. That's our summertime routine, and he was down there. What he was doing It was amazing. But as somebody who is a wave rider, wind always seems so restrictive, even though it allows you to do these other things, you're not free. You're being led a little bit. You have to hold onto it and it's behind you.

[01:57:45.270] - Speaker 2
You have a motor.

[01:57:46.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And in so being, yeah, there's a bunch of things you can do, but there is something restrictive. It's like having a dog on a leash. When you have a dog on a leash, you have to... You can't just run that way. You can't go any direction you want and do anything you want. There's something freedom about having nothing in your hands that surfing is. That leads us to that now, the expansion of what foils are. That's the frontier. All of these places.

[01:58:12.010] - Speaker 2
When did this happen?

[01:58:14.000] - Speaker 1
It's happened over the last 10 years. We're towing in the big waves, and that obviously has... There's nobody that wants to do that, really. There's not a business. You're not making these for... The amount of people, it's like big wave riding. The amount of participants doesn't justify any company or anything. You have the kiting aspect, then wingdinging, which is the wing, the kite without strings that you're holding onto that's a blow up. That's just easier to deal with. You just pump it up, you grab it, you have your foil board. Electric. So electric becomes it, which made sense that there was going to be some electric device because it's just so totally suited for that. The guy who built that was in engineering school. He saw one of our videos that had foiling in it and changed his whole thing into learning how to design that and started a company called Lyft, which builds one of the better electric. He's the first electric foil builder and one of the better ones, which I use to train as well. Really good for flat water, good for your legs, and you can go really fast on them.

[01:59:25.770] - Speaker 1
It's really good for reactive time. Still strapped in or no? For the speed, no. I could use some foot straps. I just don't put on.

[01:59:31.830] - Speaker 2
Tell me about when did the foot straps go away and why and what's the difference?

[01:59:35.230] - Speaker 1
The boot went away once the foils became less sensitive and more efficient. As Both design increased and the shapes got to a point where they were highly efficient. That allowed-The board could be stable without you being strapped in.

[01:59:55.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Whereas before, you had to be strapped in.

[01:59:57.870] - Speaker 1
You had to be booted in to deal with the leverage Just with the leverage. That had to do with the way the foil was lifting and what it was doing. Because as the wings evolve and the shapes evolve, they become more efficient, which makes them less reactive and less leverage and everything about them, they can become more stable. It's a little bit like whenever you come into a sport, after the equipment evolves, it's always easier to learn. If you tried to learn how to snowboard with the very first snowboard that they learned, no one would do it.Nearly impossible.Nearly impossible. You tried to learn with the The first skateboard, yeah, the three best surfers in the whole thing could do it and no one else. It's not skateboarding until they built the tire. You get a urethane tire, a nice truck, that changes everything. Same thing with the foils. As the foils, all of a sudden, we are able to get rid of our boots. Yeah. Actually, a guy came to visit me because my nephew put a foil on a stand-up board. Initially, I looked at it like, Oh, that looks cool. But I was like, Okay, I'm focused on the big wave.

[02:00:56.010] - Speaker 1
Might be good. Then a guy came to visit me who had who had one of the foil companies, and he brought a stand-up paddle, foil board. I went and took it out. I rode one wave. I said, Well, I'm going to take this from you or you can sell it to me. But it's not leaving my house. It's not leaving. It's not leaving my house. I'm not letting this go. He's like, Why? It's the only one I got. I go, Yeah, but you built this one, so you can build another one. You're a professional. Then now, all of a sudden, foils are the shapes, the sizes, the materials. Everything's evolving. We move into where we are right now, which is we have an enormous spectrum of disciplines and environments that we can do it, like some of the fastest sails in the world. First of all, everything's on hydrofoil. You watch America's Cup, you watch all these sailboats, everything's flying on blades. But in foiling, specifically for us, the pinnacle, just like I felt in surfing, is big wave riding. That's the top. Then also distance. There becomes some other things. Speed, distance, size. I like those things.

[02:02:08.650] - Speaker 1
Those things are... Usually, there's some relationship, but you can ride very small waves. You can ride wind-swell. You have electric, you have multiple wind-powered ones, you have stand-up paddling ones, you have prone paddling ones for surfing, so little lay-down ones or stand-up ones. We have six or seven disciplines within foiling, all different kinds of foils, sizes, shapes, and companies.

[02:02:33.330] - Speaker 2
Are those all the areas where surf is expanding the most in foils now? Without a doubt.

[02:02:38.520] - Speaker 1
Can't even compare. Now it's expanded places because normally the saturation of surfers and locations, we're pretty tapped out. Where the waves are. We only have so many waves and we have a lot more surfers. You go to a spot and there's 100 people out at every spot that's any good. Now, all of a sudden, a spot that isn't even a surf spot is a foil spot. It wouldn't be a spot unless there was foiling. It opens up our universe, which we need. We need more options, especially as I view more people participating. But it also opens up things that we haven't done, which is really that's something that's more interesting even for me is being able to do things in an environment and in locations that you've never experienced. Now we're writing We're going to places in riding waves for 6 or 7 minutes, 8 minutes. The average surfing wave is 10 seconds, maybe 20 at a long one. Now you're compounding the amount of riding time you're getting.

[02:03:43.600] - Speaker 2
Now on one surf trip, foiling trip, you could spend more time going fast on your vehicle, on your board, than if you were to combine all of the rides of your life before this.

[02:03:58.000] - Speaker 1
Yes. If we weren't doing it, I wouldn't believe it was possible.

[02:04:01.640] - Speaker 2
Imagine how much better you get with all that time.

[02:04:05.360] - Speaker 1
Also, in a way, you're expanding your view, too, your ability, because now we're looking at wave energy differently Because I always describe surfers as wave readers. Great, you can stand up and you can rip, but more impressive is you can look at a wave and know what it's going to do. That's the thing that takes all the time. Never mind you know how to stand up and you can jam around. Can you look at a wave and understand where it's moving and how it's moving? It's like, I'll go to the beach with Gabby sometimes and I'll be at a surf spot and I'll go, I'll see the guy take off. Before he gets to his feet, I go, That guy's going to get donuts. Then he goes down 10 feet and gets hit by the wave. She's like, How do you know that? I go, Well, I could just tell by his movement, his speed, what the wave was doing, that it was going to break on his head. Or you know somebody's going to make it. There's always a surprise. You're like, I thought that guy was going to make it, but he pulled it off.

[02:04:55.150] - Speaker 1
But that's where it takes the time. Now we're looking at waves. We're waves earlier that we wouldn't even have considered because we're seeing them before they break because that's when we're riding them. They're doing a lot of downwind stuff, too, where they're getting on the foil and they're able to just fly from one wave to the next to the next to the next and just fly and connect the dots and put those pieces together, which again takes that reading and that judgment, which is really probably the enticing thing of it. It's like hearing music and knowing how following it-Where it can go.where it can go. Yeah. It's an enticing thing that keeps you inspired. Because what are we trying to do is just stay inspired. How do you stay inspired if you have one day in your lifetime that you're never going to get another one like, unless you have another day in your lifetime that you're never getting another one like.

[02:05:47.010] - Speaker 2
Over the course of your life of surfing, where are you in the excitement of what you're about to do?

[02:05:53.690] - Speaker 1
The sureness of the experience I know what I'm going to do, and I'm going to get to do it. The guarantee of that has never been any higher because normally there's just too many variables, and then moments are too short and too few to have that thing. I know When I'm coming into it, I know that no matter what's going to happen, I'm going to have a hard time walking.

[02:06:20.310] - Speaker 2
Because you'll be doing it so much.

[02:06:22.010] - Speaker 1
My legs are going to be sore. I'm going to blow out before there stops being anything to do. I'm going to blow up.

[02:06:28.290] - Speaker 2
Over the course of your life, how often has that been the case?

[02:06:31.040] - Speaker 1
I mean, not a lot. I work. I mean, that's what you work towards. You seek that. There could be years and years in a row where you don't have that. You have to be careful how you say it, but in a way, it's like there is a reward or there is a blessing for dedication. Yes. But you have to stay dedicated. But it has to also why, too. You have to have the right... I just honestly believe if your intentions are genuine and you stay You're going to be blessed. The universe is going to provide you with the thing you need as long as you stay true to your... And your intention is pure. Pure. I still get it because I have a group of friends that I'm able to do it with, so I get it through that. But I made a joke the other day. I was talking about just if a tree falls in the forest and no one sees it, does it actually fall? I'm like, Yes, it does. I can tell you what? It falls. You don't need anybody to see it. I speak on my side like, I don't need anybody to know.

[02:07:35.170] - Speaker 1
I don't need anybody to see. I know what I'm going to do. I do enjoy the camaraderie because I want to share in it. It'd be like if you had the most delicious meal ever and you were by yourself. It would be great, but I'd rather sit with my four friends.

[02:07:50.060] - Speaker 2
It's more fun talking about how great it is.

[02:07:53.050] - Speaker 1
And enjoying it. I think there's that to it. Sometimes you doubt it. You doubt that that's true. It's not true. You can doubt that there is a reward, but it seems to happen every time. You don't even know it's happening. All of a sudden, you're like, Oh, look what's going on. Look what's happening. Look what we're getting to do. It's like, because we're so caught up and always trying to do, do, do, do, get, get, get, get. Then all of a sudden, but you don't realize, sometimes it just comes right around the corner, and then it's just like, ding. It's working.

[02:08:27.490] - Speaker 2
How did you- It's working. How did you meet Don Wildman?

[02:08:33.540] - Speaker 1
Somebody invited me on a helicopter snowboarding trip to Canada. It was with Jerry Lopez. It was a friend of his, a guy named Tom Flager, and he said, Hey, you want to come helicopter snowboarding with us? We go to this great place called Mike Wigley's. It's like the premier Austrian guy that started a helicopter. Best food, best area. We went there and I was sitting at dinner. We just had finished a great day of riding. Somebody said, See that guy over there at that table? It was Dawn sitting at the table with his gray, just his Dawn-ness. He was sitting there and they're like, You really need to meet that guy. I walked over and I said, Hello. I think somebody told me his name, Mr. Wild. I go, Hey, Mr. Wildman, or Hey, Dawn, my name's Laird. Nice to meet you. Hey, how's it going? He had a big smile. I was like, You could feel his energy. It was Okay, great to meet you. Nice to meet you. Then I left and didn't see him and no word. Then three years later, I'm with Gabby. We're in Malibu. I walk into a restaurant in Malibu, and Dawn sitting at the restaurant.

[02:09:51.170] - Speaker 1
I said, Hey, what are you doing? He goes, I live right down the road. I go, I just moved right down the road. Then Then that was it. That was like the, come over and taught me how to bike. I taught him how to foil.

[02:10:07.430] - Speaker 2
How much older was he than you?

[02:10:09.750] - Speaker 1
Dawn was what he was...

[02:10:12.230] - Speaker 2
30 years older than you, something like that?

[02:10:13.490] - Speaker 1
Yeah, 30.30 years older. He'd be like... Would he be like 90 something right now, I think. He'd be like 92. So something like that, 32.

[02:10:24.800] - Speaker 2
How would you describe him?

[02:10:26.820] - Speaker 1
Well, he's a bare-knuckle fighter. First of all, when you look at First of all, when you look at Don, you're like, This is a bear-knuckle fighter. This guy would fight bear-knuckles. Anytime, any place, no problem. That's your feeling you get. You just feel like a bear. This is a bear. It just beyond enthusiastic, beyond open, beyond interested.

[02:10:49.070] - Speaker 2
He seemed to love life more than anybody. Love it.

[02:10:51.450] - Speaker 1
Love it. Love living.And.

[02:10:52.440] - Speaker 2
Enjoy it.

[02:10:53.650] - Speaker 1
Enjoy. Professional. Professional enjoyer. Listen, I always use this story. He'd come over to my house, We'd make him a steak. He'd be eating and he'd say, This is the best steak I've ever had. Four days later, I'd invite him over to my house. I'd make a steak. He's like, This is the best steak I've ever had. It was always the best steak I ever had. He was open in a way to music. I always laughed because I'd like, You couldn't invite him on anything that he wouldn't go on unless he just had some other tied up. Hey, Dawn, I'm going to go jump out of a plane without a parachute. Sounds fun. Let's go. It didn't matter what you said. It didn't matter what you said. Which one you wanted. One time we were at Chopul, he's in Tahiti, Chopul, and John doesn't really surf. He surfs a little bit. He doesn't surf. He's sitting in the boat.

[02:11:47.710] - Speaker 2
He doesn't Chopu surf?

[02:11:49.960] - Speaker 1
No. And not even remotely near Chopoo surf. After about 40 minutes or an hour of me towing, I come over by the boat, he goes, he waves me and comes over. He goes, I think I'm ready for one. I looked at him, I go, Hey, Dawn, I love you. You are not ready for one. He goes, I'm not. I go, You're not. He goes, Okay, good. There was a lot of those. There was a lot of those. But him and I had a crazy, beautiful relationship. I had a lot of incredible trips with Dawn, a lot of heavy-Tell me about the race across America. Oh, God, yeah. Well, first of all, Dawn was a professional sufferer. He could suffer professionally.Better.

[02:12:40.340] - Speaker 2
Than anybody.

[02:12:41.890] - Speaker 1
Very few in the world I've ever seen that could suffer so well. Actually, after being uncomfortable for a long time, he would actually get better. He would start to do better. He didn't do worse. It wasn't like he suffered for two days. He would start to Excel. But his endurance thing started with the Ironman. He sold his company and turned into an Ironman guy. I guess he made, bragged about he was going to start doing triathlons or something like that. Then his boys said, Well, they just said in Forbes or something, you're going to do triathlons. You're going to be a real jerk if you don't start. So he just started doing Ironman. I think he started when he was 50, and he did an Ironman every year for 10 years or 12 years in a row and never missed. I think he got second and then finally won his age division or something. Always second or or winning or second. He obviously loves endurance stuff. So he suckered me into... I suckered him in this. We would always sucker each other into certain things, but this was a suffering he suckered me into. I was like, I didn't want to do it because it was...

[02:13:45.630] - Speaker 1
Part of the reason why I didn't want to do it, I don't like the formality of it. I don't like event. It's competition. Yeah, I just don't like the thing. I don't mind doing something brutal. I don't mind going with other people and trying to beat people in brutal things. I just didn't want to participate in a structured thing. He goes, We'll do this. There's this thing called the Race Across America, and I've done it once before, and I think we could do really well. I got a team of us. I think you're good. I got this other guy, Timmy C, who's the bass player for Rage. I got this other friend, this other guy, Jason, who's an ex-football quarterback. I go, I think we could just really hammer him.

[02:14:21.480] - Speaker 2
This is a bike race where the other racers in it are all professional bike racers.

[02:14:25.990] - Speaker 1
That's right. Yeah, these are professional bike racers. But But Dawn has it in his mind. He understands. He goes, Oh, you're VO2 max. You're guys' ability to suffer. We're in. I go, Okay, I'll do it. But my contingent is that we have to paddle to the start, which is a 24-hour paddle, and it's from Malibu to Oceanside. So Malibu to Oceanside, but we're going to relay it. We're going to do the bike race. It's not going to be completely bad. It's just you're not going to paddle consecutively, but we're going to relay all the way down there.To.

[02:14:56.270] - Speaker 2
Get to the race.To.

[02:14:57.160] - Speaker 1
Get to the race. Which I don't think the racers appreciated that. But it wasn't about them. It was about us. We went.

[02:15:04.430] - Speaker 2
That's what made it fun for you.

[02:15:06.050] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm like, Okay, I'll do it, but I want to do the... I want to do it because I was doing these things called Paddle and Peddles. I had gotten Dawn to do one with me and Hawaii. I took Dawn on this one where we biked across every island and paddled across every channel in Hawaii. In five days, we went 500 miles. He said it was worse than 10 Ironmans, but I think he's making me feel good.

[02:15:29.560] - Speaker 2
So you either biked if it was land or paddled if it was water across the entire chain of Hawaii.

[02:15:37.770] - Speaker 1
From the Southernmost point to the northernmost point. Every island, every channel. The first bike was 125 miles. Then we paddled for 35. The longest paddle was 22 and a half hours. But we did those consecutive. Anyway, before or after, I'm not sure, but he's like, Perfect. Here we go. Race across America. Him and I were on a team, and then Timmy C and Jason were on the other team. Then when we were really going, we would be like 30 minutes. Everybody would go. I'd go 30 minutes as hard as I could. Then he'd go 30 minutes. Then Jason goes 30 minutes.

[02:16:08.860] - Speaker 2
How long was the race? Tell me what the race is first.

[02:16:10.580] - Speaker 1
The race is from Oceanside to Delaware.

[02:16:15.310] - Speaker 2
Oceanside, California to Delaware. Yes.across the entire country.Yeah.Bike only.Bike only. And how long does it take?

[02:16:23.680] - Speaker 1
Three or four days. No, four or five days.

[02:16:26.230] - Speaker 2
It's 24 hours a day.

[02:16:28.220] - Speaker 1
24 hours a day. Somebody usually He dies along the thing. He was run over by a truck or something like that. Donna Dunn before, he thought we had a really good chance to win.

[02:16:35.540] - Speaker 2
Donna Dunn was in the '70s at this time? Yeah, late '70s.Late '70s.Yeah. You're a surfer. We got a guy in rage against the machine. We have an injured football player.

[02:16:47.880] - Speaker 1
An ex- College football guy, but who's got a big VO2 max.

[02:16:51.290] - Speaker 2
Going against professional bikers.Yeah..

[02:16:54.140] - Speaker 1
We start, and there is a... Obviously, you have to go... There's a lot of I think we climbed something crazy within the first two days. We climbed, I want to say, we were alternating, but we climbed more than 75,000 feet of elevation between the four of us, which was a lot, a lot of elevation. You're going day and night, so you're not sleeping. You're riding in a trailer, and then you're getting in the bike, and you're just doing like that, and you can't eat, and you just feel terrible. Dawn just loves that. He He thought it was great. He thought that was a fun thing. We were leading the race when we got off the mountains. Technically, the mountains would have been our weakness. It was the hardest part. It would have been our weakness because we were bigger guys. I remember at one point, there was another team that caught up to us. We had some weird stuff going on. Dawn hired a manager to help us manage the times and the whole thing, somebody that had done it before. He was undermining us the whole time. So he was actually trying to break us.

[02:18:05.250] - Speaker 1
He kept saying, This is Ram and da, da, da, and the whole thing. I caught onto it. I'm like, Dawn, this guy's sabotaging us. He's making us go in paces and doing things to break us. I go, This guy is... And then lead us down the wrong road, the navigation, off. There was some stuff going on. Once Dawn finally realized that the guy was doing that, then he's like, Okay, he fired the guy. But the guy was doing stuff like, you'd have to do a change. The guy would be on the bike ready to go, and then he'd start riding. Then once you passed his back tire, Then he'd pull over and get in the van and go. But the van would be waiting. You'd be just grinding away, feeling nauseous, not sleep and can't eat. You'd see the van, you'd think, Here it comes. The guy would be just poising there, and then he'd just drive off and you'd have a big hill climb after.He would make you thinkPsychological. He was doing some weird stuff. I'm like, Dawn, this guy's messing with us. The guy was waiting at the bottom of the hill, and I remember coming down a hill, and the guy was sitting in the car, and I knew it was the guy, knew what he was doing.

[02:19:14.020] - Speaker 1
As I went by, I just put my elbow out and hit the side mirror on the van, and it slapped on the front window, and the guy jumped out of his seat. It was right after that, Dawn fired him. They sent him away. But we were leading the race, and now we're in the flats, which means that we were really going to roll, and we all started feeling better. I mean, you're listening, you're up in tallest New Mexico at whatever, how many thousand feet breathing. It feels like you're breathing out of a straw and you're having to ride as hard as you can. It was definitely a test of will. But Dawn just felt better and better. We get to Hermann, Missouri. The one guy passes my friend, then it's my turn, and I ride up alongside the guy, and the guy says like, This is what we do, or whatever, like, Hey, surfer boy, or something like that, which was probably not the thing to tell me at that particular time. I just left him and horizon dropped the guy, and then trains with Jason, and then Jason was going, and then we were going to start rolling.

[02:20:18.110] - Speaker 1
We were feeling good. That guy's escort vehicle passed us, went up, and ran over Jason, hit him with the car and broke his leg.

[02:20:29.020] - Speaker 2
It's unbelievable.

[02:20:29.990] - Speaker 1
Broke his leg in Hermann, Missouri. I was behind in our van, and the guy passed us and just went right and literally ran. I saw Jason go down. I thought Jason got run over. I thought he was dead. I thought he was killed. I was with camermen, officer suite, and I, the three of us who were observers, watched him hit the guy, went over there. Jason was on the ground but only broken leg. Then that was it because he was out. We couldn't do it. We could have gone three guys, but Dawn was all about winning. Don didn't care about the... It was all about... We were on track to break the record at that point, and everybody felt good, and we were rolling, and now we're in the flats. We were in Hermann, Missouri. Everything from then on was just we were going to be in the big spoke, big gear, just grinding away. Then the race officials called it a mutual collision.

[02:21:22.610] - Speaker 2
Because a bicycle and a car crash, a truck?

[02:21:26.100] - Speaker 1
Crash. A minivan. The guy you can see, because what happens is people are driving 24 hours a day, and we were changing all the time. People get delirious. But the guy ran over our guy and we were in headband. I could see by the way his-Did that team end up winning?

[02:21:41.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:21:42.390] - Speaker 1
It was amazing. It was amazing. For them to catch usIt turns out in these competitions, people cheat. Beyond. Which maybe that's my thing because I go back to the thing of why does that... Why have I always been turned off by that stuff? Because it's like I've just seen it my whole life. I just go... And the winners win, but sometimes they don't win when they should, but they win when they need, when they do.

[02:22:08.410] - Speaker 2
What's odd to me about a surf competition is every wave is different.

[02:22:11.980] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's hard enough when you're dealing with lines and baskets. It's hard enough when you're dealing with all these fixed things, you get weird stuff that goes on. You're like, That was a weird call. That changed that whole game. Never mind how ambiguous art, music, food.

[02:22:33.000] - Speaker 2
I don't think it's a good motivator. I think it brings out the worst in people. Completely.

[02:22:38.330] - Speaker 1
It brings out the worst in me. That's what I notice. I noticed for me, personally, I don't like who I am when I do that. It just makes me so... I'm already too aggressive. I'm trying to learn how to navigate all of that energy. I'm like, How do I nurture that? But also, how do I productively use that? How do I productively use... Well, you know I do well. Put me in these heavy situations, then I feel useful, worthy. I can actually have camaraderie with my guys. If they do well and I do well, or we can work together to achieve this thing, that feels amazing. I'm like, That feels That feels like the human condition that really made us successful. When we had to navigate surviving in nature with giant animals that could eat us that were a lot smarter and faster, or maybe not smarter, maybe smarter. But maybe smarter. That feels like the attitude that would make us successful, not this us against each other. That seems to never make us successful. That only makes us less successful. But so he got run over, Jason, which ended up being a blessing because he ended up marrying my nanny and having a beautiful family.

[02:23:48.420] - Speaker 1
The end of the thing, maybe it was for that. Maybe we don't realize it. We were bummed about it. But then we went to New York and we paddled around the Statue of Liberty because that was part of our paddle and pedal piece of it. But we were just two because Jason's leg was broken. The three of us could have done it, but it defeated the purpose. Exactly. Dawn lost the interest, but he was feeling… I just remember how strong he was and how well he did under that pressure. I think, obviously, Korea, the war, the things that he had been through. In his business, he always used to… I guess he said to me, he always tell the people, he goes, This isn't life or death. I know what life or death is. This is not life or death. Even though he definitely wouldn't stand down to anybody, not even close. I remember the time he got on testosterone, his woman at the time was having some acne problems. Then she was like, That's weird. I never had that issue. Then she realized it was because he was using some cream for testosterone that was getting on her and giving her acne.

[02:24:56.630] - Speaker 1
Then they're like, Okay, we got to stop using that cream. He's 70 something, so a little testosterone, probably not going to be bad for him. Then he's like, Okay, let me talk to somebody who I know. He talks to our one friend, and our one friend is a lot of experience, and he goes, Here, I'll set you up. He sets him up with the thing, a kit and whatever. Then all of a sudden, two weeks in, he's trying to get in a fight in the parking lot. Then he's going to Vegas. He goes to Vegas with his girl, and they don't leave the room for three days. She's like, Honey, maybe we should just check your levels and just see what their What they are. He goes, Sure, okay.

[02:25:32.670] - Speaker 2
He's almost 80 at this point.

[02:25:34.150] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I feel good, though. He goes, I'm good. She goes, Well, let's just check them. Let's just check the levels.Yeah. The story is she's at home and the fax machine goes off because he still has a fax machine. Gets the thing and all. He said, she just started laughing. He's like, What is it, honey? She's like, I got the results back. He's like, What are they? She goes, Well, your testosterone is 1,800. They call our buddy and they say, Hey, the things are 1,800. He goes, Don't worry, mine are 2,000. Anyway, he toned it back a little bit. I think that helped because he was literally He wanted to get in a fight. She looked a little tired.

[02:26:20.540] - Speaker 2
Didn't you once go mountain climbing with him?

[02:26:23.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Tell me about that. We've been in an avalanche. Dawn and I were in an avalanche. I was in an avalanche with Dawn. We've had a few things. I mean, he got hit in the face with the board. He had the punctured lung the time he had the punctured lung. The time he crushed his tibial plateau and then had to be... I mean, he was like humpty-dumpty. Literally, Break, glue back together. One time, he fell on his bicycle at his house in Utah on black ice and then broke his femur. He was laying on the black ice, and the guys couldn't get to him because it was so slippery, they couldn't even... But he gets home, he's He's got one of his legs is incapacitated. Every time he goes to the doctor, they just can't believe how fast he heals. I go in the gym, he has his crutch on one of the pedals of the stationary bike, and then his other leg that works on the other pedal. He's pedaling, but the other leg is obviously can't work, so it's on the side, and he literally is doing cardio.

[02:27:23.400] - Speaker 2
One-legged bicycling with the cane on the other side.

[02:27:27.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah, crutch on one pedal, crutch on one pedal with arms, leg on the other side like that. Oh, I got to do my cardio. Like, beyond obsessed. Beyond obsessed with training.

[02:27:38.030] - Speaker 2
Well, he would say if he didn't train, he wouldn't eat.

[02:27:40.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's right.

[02:27:41.310] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the mountain climbing.

[02:27:42.750] - Speaker 1
No, he goes, Hey, I want to go do Everest. I said, Okay. I'm the guy he sucks in. I'll go, and then maybe I'm there. He can help me. I can help him, whatever. He's like, Hey, I want to do Everest. I go, Well, how about before you do Everest, let's just do a little hill like Rainier, which is the longest endurance climb in North America after McKenley. But McKenley takes three weeks. Rainier, you can go up there, you can hike up halfway, sleep the night, and then hike to the top and hike all the way back down. So we go, Okay, let's go to Rainier. So we go down, and his knees are hurting him. I think this is before he's got the double knee surgery. We're going, and somehow they feed us burritos. They feed us bean and chicken burritos. We're in a tent, the two of us. I would say it's a gassy night, but it's beyond. It was beyond. It was beyond the point where it was just we didn't even care. We were on the top of the glacier. We wake up early in the morning, we hike, we're going.

[02:28:49.570] - Speaker 1
I think Dawn's son, John, his youngest son is with us. I'm behind John. At one point, John's headlamp falls into a crack. John tries to get I'm like, John, you can't get it. You're not going to get it. And the guy in the front goes, Hey, stay away from that crack. That's where 10 or 12 people fell, and they never found them. I'm like, Exactly. Keep going. So we go, we do the top, we come back down, and we're part You're very down. When you are down climbing, the weight is seven times your body weight on your leg. The down pressure when you're... So down climbing is a lot harder. Everybody thinks it's about going up. It has nothing to do with going up. It's about coming down. That's why people have so much problem is they think the summit is the achievement. No.

[02:29:32.270] - Speaker 2
Making it to the bottom is the achievement.

[02:29:33.980] - Speaker 1
You know what the parking lot is called, Rainier? Paradise. There's a reason it's called Paradise. It's because when you get back, you're glad that you're back. Anyway, we hike, we down climb, and we're about part way through. We're a little ways through, and somehow our other friend has talked the guide into carrying his pack. Dawn says to the guide, I will not only give you all of the hiking gear that I bought that's brand new, I will pay you double of what this guy is going to pay you. Here's my pack, here's my stuff. Take it. The guy ended up taking his stuff and carrying it down the hill. But that cured Dawn for about the Everest. He was good. He was like, I don't need to do Everest. I'm like, I'm with you.
