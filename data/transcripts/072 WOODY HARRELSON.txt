[00:00:06.820] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton.

[00:00:22.160] - Speaker 1
Sometimes I feel like these characters I've gotten to play, I feel like I resonate with this character already, just as soon as I've read the script or read the book or whatever it is that introduces me into the character. But as for how it works, I don't know. It's just about a certain believability. If the audience believes you, then you're golden. And if they don't, you're screwed. And then inside of that, you're just hoping to do one or two things that are interesting and not be just totally boring, which I've also been guilty Do you have to believe the character? Yeah, that's for sure. If I don't believe the character, there's a disconnect that I can't get over. The writing is always the number one thing, because even if you get the greatest director, which you would always think that's number one. But even if you get Scorsese or someone great, they can't necessarily fix a broken script. That's the weird thing is I have accepted parts and movies or in a play or whatever that I, afterward, have no idea why did I do that? I'd never connected to it. It never resonated right with me.

[00:01:47.950] - Speaker 1
Why did I do it? So I just come away feeling somewhat dirty from it. Like I just sold myself somehow. Well, yeah.

[00:02:00.390] - Speaker 2
But even in those cases, do you get better at your craft every time you do your job?

[00:02:08.010] - Speaker 1
I think when you do your job badly, you don't really get better at your craft. And I've felt the, not outward critique of that, but my internal critique of that, even lately. I would think after all this time, okay, surely I'm not going to be doing stuff that I'm not proud of or being a part of something I'm not proud of. But damn.

[00:02:39.000] - Speaker 2
It can still happen. But also you're not in control of the whole thing.

[00:02:43.880] - Speaker 1
That's true. You got to trust your director. I mean, really, it's like one A and one B script, director, and then the other actors would be number two. And, of course, the DP then would be number three.

[00:03:03.880] - Speaker 2
Is the script always about the story, or could it be about something else?

[00:03:08.710] - Speaker 1
Well, that's interesting. I've been reading interviews with Fulini, and it's fascinating how much his script may not even have a cohesive story or plot or anything. It's like dream this neorealism, then just you're just supposed to flow with this It's something that doesn't even seem to have a tangible story. It makes me want to watch all these 8:30 and the Dolce & Vita and all these movies because I want to see Filmmaking from another perspective. Naturally, the way I grew up is, and probably you, too, is just like, well, it needs to have a story, a plot, defined characters, great direction. It has to have all that.

[00:04:04.310] - Speaker 2
How did you learn your craft?

[00:04:08.650] - Speaker 1
Well, what I did, I started in high school, and I actually started in in a church. I was quite religious. Well, you don't have to be quite religious to be in a church, but I was. And then I got this part. It was like the telling of the Nativity.

[00:04:30.930] - Speaker 2
Nativity.

[00:04:32.560] - Speaker 1
And I played this drunk who came. I got to come through the church from the back of the church up the aisle. And I'm singing, and I fell down on my great grandmother who was sitting next to my grandmother. And I tell you, it was just a one-shot dealia, but the audience really responded. I wasn't trying to be an actor at that point, and I was maybe 16 or so, and it turned out great. So then the next thing that happened was, I think it was around Christmas time, and I was in the library, and I used to When Elvis died, I sent away... You could send away a nickel and get a bunch of records. And among the records I got, I think it was called Elvis's Golden Oldies, right? So I got the album And I started listening to it. And then I started singing, doing my little bit of Elvis. So I'm in the library and some guys from the football team, which was the only place I used to sometimes sing it on the bus, on the football bus, going to games or going home from games. And the guys were like, These guys I owe my life to.

[00:05:57.450] - Speaker 1
And I wouldn't know them. I wouldn't know the name or the face. Nothing. If you told me to this day, it's terrible. They were like, Do your Elvis. And I'm like, We're in the library, dude. I can't do my Elvis. Do it, do it. It's too loud. Well, do it quiet. I can't do it quiet. I don't know how to do it quiet. I've never done it quiet. They're like, Just try. Just do it a little bit. And they kept insisting and thank God because then I started, Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me? I'm aging like a man on a fuzzy tree. My friends say, he's mad and wild as a bug, I'm in love. I'm always shook up, and then slowly truly, people start coming around. And then I can't keep it quiet. I just didn't know how to do it. I don't, to this day, know how to do Elvis quietly. But anyway, they started clapping and clapping. And then pretty soon, when it gets to that part in the song, Well, my heart beats, so it's getting me to death. And I jump up on the table, and it's just before Christmas, so it's packed in the library.

[00:07:15.090] - Speaker 1
In the hole, they were all gathered around. Everybody in the library was gathered around the table clapping.

[00:07:23.010] - Speaker 2
It's amazing. You'd never done anything like this before?

[00:07:25.580] - Speaker 1
Never. I mean, I had song. The only singing, even For anyone outside of my own family was for the guys on the football bus I started singing because I couldn't help it once I started listening to those songs. Anyway, so this was literally a unique thing for me. And it was Maybe the most extraordinary event of my life because it was a birthing story. Because what happened, I sang, and at the end, everybody was clapping, even the library, and everyone was psyched. And up came Robin Rogers. And Robin Rogers was dating the Supreme Jock of the school. And she was so far outside my time zone. I mean, she was in another hemisphere, right? And the fact that she even talked to me was rather... She says, Hi, I'm Robin. And I go, I know. And she says, Hey, I'm the vice President of the drama club. Maybe you want to come try out for the school play? And I was like, Yeah, yeah, yeah. She said, Robin Rogers wants me to. So I did. I tried out for the play the next... I think it was the next term or whatever, the next year, maybe.

[00:08:38.250] - Speaker 1
I tried out for it, and I got a little part, and that's what started me getting on stage. It's thanks to Elvis and Robin.

[00:08:49.720] - Speaker 2
How would you say the people perceived you in school before that moment?

[00:08:55.870] - Speaker 1
Well, I think they perceived me as... I was a A bit of a class clown. So in that sense, there was also another a performance. I used to have these things in my mind when the teacher would say something, and I would have a zinger in my mind, but I just wouldn't say it. And I knew it was funny, but I just wouldn't say anything. And I was quite shy for a while. And then I remember, I don't know, I think it was in the eighth or ninth grade, I finally let loose and said something, and it was dead quiet. And then two seconds passed and the whole class cracked up. So in a sense, I guess you would call that performance as well. And I used to do another thing. I just remember. I'm glad you're asking me that because I used to do this thing where I was a sugar junkie. I was a hard core junkie. And to this day, I will tell you, sugar Sugar is the most difficult drug I ever quit. Granted, the only drug I ever quit. But at the time, I was fully addicted. So I'd come to class frequently, and I was just so...

[00:10:14.420] - Speaker 1
I had the trajectory of the sugar. And then it, of course, takes you down. And I'm slumped over on the desk, barely keeping my head up, or maybe not keeping my head up. And then the teacher, and what do you think, Woody? And of course, I have no fucking clue what she's talking about. I don't even have any idea whatsoever. So I lift my head up and I'd be like, well, funny you should ask that. I was thinking metaphorically. Well, no, you know what? Even in real terms, no matter how, and I just keep going until the whole class was laughing. I'd never I say anything, but I just get... I'm thinking the first part of the question... Well, anyway, the entire... Look, what I'm believing now, in my gut, if you know, sometimes you have to really go deep in thinking, I just keep going, and even the teacher would laugh. And so I started feeling like I was a a class clown. And so once I started in the theater, there was an avenue, particularly in these comedians comedic plays that I did in college and such, where I had an avenue for, I think, what was bursting to express itself.

[00:11:40.100] - Speaker 2
How is doing comedy different than drama?

[00:11:44.290] - Speaker 1
To me, it's more interesting. Well, I mean, when you're getting emotional or something, yeah, there's obviously things you have to access for that. But my first professional thing was actually Goldie on movie. And then while I was there doing that, one of the guys named Leo Jeter, he came up to me and he said, Hey, I just tried out for this part in this show called Cheers. And I didn't watch TV at the time because I'd been a television actor. So when I went to college, I wanted to just stay away from it. So I didn't know about it. And he's like, You should try out for it. I'm like, No, dude, I really don't. I don't want to do television. I just don't want to. I want to do theater. Then I went and watched it. I'm like, oh, it's wild.

[00:12:36.990] - Speaker 2
How long it had already been on?

[00:12:38.730] - Speaker 1
And it had been on for three years. But that three years, I quit once I went to college. So So it was while I was in college that Cheers started airing.

[00:12:48.900] - Speaker 2
Was it a hit out of the box?

[00:12:51.840] - Speaker 1
No, it was at the end of the first season, it was the lowest thing of every single show.

[00:12:59.470] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:12:59.600] - Speaker 1
And it was during reruns. For some reason, I don't know, forget what it was that caused people to watch it during reruns, but they caught it during reruns, and then it started gaining steam. And by the time I was on it, it was consistently in the top 10.

[00:13:17.820] - Speaker 2
Wow. How old were you when you got that job?

[00:13:20.960] - Speaker 1
Well, I was 23 when I auditioned for it and got it. But then I just turned 24 when I started shooting.

[00:13:30.340] - Speaker 2
How many episodes in the season? How many episodes did you do?

[00:13:33.570] - Speaker 1
Twenty-six, and then 26 reruns during the season.

[00:13:36.950] - Speaker 2
Would you do the 26 in a row or was that broken up?

[00:13:40.290] - Speaker 1
No, that would be broken up. You'd have a week off. They always had to catch up with the scripts. I mean, these writers, man, they were writing superlative material. The greatest writers. I mean, obviously, there's great writers, but among the greatest writers that I-Did you ever watch the writing sessions? No, I went in there one time, and I remember I made a comment, and they're like, Woody, you're just here to watch.

[00:14:08.060] - Speaker 2
But describe that scene. What was it like?

[00:14:10.260] - Speaker 1
How did it work? It was really cool. Tell me. I think it was eight, maybe nine writers. Well, the Charles brothers were the creators, right? And as well as Jimmy Burrows. But for a good period of time, when I was there, they weren't really around. And For some of it, they were. And then they came in back toward the end to try to make everything great that last season. They were there quite a bit. But anyway, they did come in either way from time to time. They weren't totally ignoring it. And they were definitely reading every episode and making sure and adding jokes. And there'd be days where they'd have just great writers come in for little punch-up It's on a Monday or something. We shot Tuesdays.

[00:15:04.340] - Speaker 2
So what day would you see the script for the show for Tuesday?

[00:15:08.120] - Speaker 1
On the Wednesday. The next day, we'd come in and we'd read a new script, and we hadn't even seen it.

[00:15:14.440] - Speaker 2
So Wednesday So you say you're seeing a script for the first time, and the following Tuesday, you're going to shoot it?

[00:15:18.460] - Speaker 1
Yeah, one week.

[00:15:20.340] - Speaker 2
And then tell me about that first on Wednesday. Was it like a table read?

[00:15:24.510] - Speaker 1
Table read, yeah. We'd literally read it at the table with the writers and everybody there to listen to it, and then we'd go home.

[00:15:32.240] - Speaker 2
Script-wise, how much would it change from that first table read till the time that you shot it?

[00:15:37.070] - Speaker 1
It varied. It depended on the quality of the script. Sometimes it would change remarkably. Sometimes it would just take this out, add this joke, where the structure would be the same or whatever. They were always finding stuff. And it was such a privilege to be there at this time in this show that was really quite beloved in America and sometimes some other places in the world. But say a joke, something on the floor, meaning when we were shooting it, the joke didn't work. And that I got to witness many times where the writers would circle up and they'd just start pitching ideas for, Here's a better way for this joke. What about this? And then they'd hit something. That's good. Okay. Then we'd try that. Or they'd give us a couple of things. We'd try it a couple of ways.Was.

[00:16:32.780] - Speaker 2
It shot in front of an audience?Yeah.

[00:16:34.720] - Speaker 1
Always. Always.

[00:16:37.630] - Speaker 2
Was it shot like a play? Did it take 30 minutes to shoot an episode?

[00:16:43.670] - Speaker 1
No, we do a rehearsal, dress rehearsal, then a run through. Then we do the show at 6:30 or something. And that would usually take about three hours with a guy like Jim Burrows, who's the greatest of all time. He's like you. He's a goat. And then once people would leave, he might do some reshoots where Jimmy felt like he needed another angle. I see.Usually.

[00:17:22.060] - Speaker 2
For a technical reason.Yeah..

[00:17:25.390] - Speaker 1
Just like, okay, I need... George is listening to Johnny in, but I didn't get George. Usually, if it had to do with a joke, that he needed a joke in front of the audience. It would always be in front of the audience. He would rarely do jokes. It was other stuff, like, say, doing a monolog. In fact, that happened to me. That was the first time I learned that marijuana and acting do not mix, although I know some very great actors who seem to think it does. I won't reveal who they are. But I went upstairs thinking we were done. And me and George were smoking a joint, and I hear over the intercom, Come down for your monolong and sing, See, Woody. And I'm just like, in the middle of, Oh, my God. You know what I mean? And I went down, and what would have taken me? One take. Oh, let's do that again. Woody, you all right? Yeah, no problem. Just try it again. Take 10 takes. It was brutal.

[00:18:43.560] - Speaker 2
Brutal. Could you not remember the lines?

[00:18:46.490] - Speaker 1
It wasn't that. It's just everything that you take for granted in terms of just doing a performance, all of the little things with timing and little inflections or whatever, whatever nuance you give to the verbiage, it suddenly all of that goes out the window when you get high. Well, for me, because I just go straight to paranoia, extreme paranoia.

[00:19:18.090] - Speaker 2
So you're questioning yourself as you're doing it?

[00:19:21.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I see. Well, yeah. I get really outside of myself, and I just, This is terrible. And I guess that self-critic is what destroys it.

[00:19:33.410] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the cast.

[00:19:36.010] - Speaker 1
Well, I mean, it was just the greatest people, the greatest guys. Me and Teddy. Well, as you know, Teddy and I do this podcast.

[00:19:46.480] - Speaker 2
When did the podcast start?

[00:19:49.100] - Speaker 1
Oh, we started, I don't know, like a year and a half ago or something.

[00:19:53.960] - Speaker 2
And you guys have remained friends since the Cheers days?

[00:19:56.840] - Speaker 1
Well, we had, but we spent a lot of time apart. You know how It is like you just...

[00:20:01.560] - Speaker 2
Of course.

[00:20:02.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I realized sometimes I'm like, I haven't seen this person for a year or something. Oh, well, in that time, I did this, this, and this, and time just went. But we still manage to see each other on and off. And then he had the idea. And so pretty cool. But it starts at the head, and the head of our show is Ted Danson, and he was He's just the greatest fucking guy. I mean, he is. He's the greatest guy. He's such a sweetheart and never had any ego about whatever, just being a superstar. He was never, ever, anything weird about it. And every Tuesday night we'd play foosball, me and Teddy and Kelsey and George, and we'd have battles. People were just thinking. Just to watch it was a spectacle because we'd be very animated. You know how actors get when you give them a... We're partying, of course, too, after work, so we're all animated.

[00:21:11.580] - Speaker 2
So this is like the celebration for finishing that week's show, yes? Yeah.

[00:21:15.040] - Speaker 1
Our Tuesday night was our Friday night. Yeah.

[00:21:20.280] - Speaker 2
Would you think of the cast like a team?

[00:21:25.240] - Speaker 1
It's like being with the... If you're playing basketball and if I pass it to him, he's definitely scoring. You know what I mean? It's like there's such confidence or footie. You know that you want to send it over to this guy. Oh, he's got it or she's got it. And they were all just all home run hitters. Ria, Kelsey, George, John, Kirsty.

[00:21:56.960] - Speaker 2
How is it different on a movie Because it's a shorter period of time that you have your team.

[00:22:04.460] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, I remember going to church camp, and it was one week, and I would make the closest friends imaginable. We would be pen pals for years. And not any friendships, obviously, that lasted, unfortunately. But in the context of a movie, you do really develop very good friends. You should. To me, this is an important part of the creative process, and I'd be interested in your perspective on it. If it doesn't turn into a family, even a dysfunctional family, it doesn't work. I don't care how you try to fake it. It needs to become almost familial, and there needs to be that trust that develops between a brother and a sister, mother and a daughter, whatever it is. You need to They have that trust and caring. And also, they do all those exercises, in acting exercises that engender trust, where you fall backwards and you hope they catch you.

[00:23:15.650] - Speaker 2
I don't know anything about this. Tell me about the acting exercise.

[00:23:17.870] - Speaker 1
I'm just saying that there are these exercises in acting workshops and everything where the thing they're trying to do is get you to trust each other. And just like in sports, sports are a very telling thing about people. You got the people who yell at themselves or yell at the other people. You can really learn a lot about someone doing a sport. Well, the same thing is true when you're acting, you really start to see what people are all about. And in a way, that's where you can fall in love with people and care about people or vice versa.

[00:23:56.870] - Speaker 2
How much of acting is reacting?

[00:23:59.960] - Speaker 1
Well, I think you'd find a lot of people say that that is acting. Acting is reacting. I did a play recently in London, and there was me, Andy Serkis, and Louisa Harland, just three people. And it was cool. It was the night before we're starting rehearsal on a play. I'm the actor. There's the director, Andy Serkis, and then Louisa Harland was the writer. Anyway, this buddy of mine, Anne, was like, That Louisa is incredible. She was just so in character all the time. And it started me thinking, Am I in character all the time? I don't remember. Am I just sometimes just watching the other two there do their thing? Am I still in character when I'm not speaking? You see some of these actors who are so gifted at listening and so compelling when they're listening. You're a great listener. You're a very expressive listener. And that to me, that's a craft I haven't mastered. Listening, generally, probably is a craft I have mastered. But certainly on film, I'm always wanting to do better.

[00:25:22.680] - Speaker 2
How is theater different than movies?

[00:25:27.970] - Speaker 1
Well, I started in theater, and I feel like theater is what acting is. It's the ultimate in acting because you can do a movie and maybe you'll see one or two performers conferences with an audience, which is still not the same. But when you are acting and the audience is reacting to you, and in this case, the show we just did was a comedy, a very edgy comedy. But it was a comedy. And to make people laugh, I got to say that's where it all started for me. Yeah. So I love theater. I love it. It's not exactly a lucrative profession, but it really is. It's where the fun is.

[00:26:21.390] - Speaker 2
How different are the performances from night to night?

[00:26:26.570] - Speaker 1
I noticed quite a bit of variance because a lot of it does depend on the audience. And let's say the audience is not responding to this at the beginning or that at the beginning, and suddenly you're in a different room here. This is a different deal or vice versa. It's a big They're just reacting huge. And suddenly you're just on skates. It's fucking great when that happens. And you just feel like, oh, there's no wrong, as opposed to suddenly you got walls everywhere Where when you're freaked, it's not working.

[00:27:03.980] - Speaker 2
From night to night, do the same jokes get the same laughs or not necessarily?

[00:27:10.870] - Speaker 1
Mostly. Mostly? Yeah. I mean, it's pretty consistent. Most audiences It has similar tastes. But I remember one night we did it. It was every night, standing ovation. When I first did a play in London, I was told, Now, listen, they're a very muted crowd. They're not going to stand for you. And luckily, it was a great play. And we did get standing ovations every night. That was called On an Average Day. That was a really good play. It was me and Kyle McLauchlin. Great. Who I really... I love that guy. I got to track him down because I haven't seen him in ages. That's an example of the the the weird thing about our profession is you're with someone so intensely And then suddenly... But I saw a picture of him the other day, and I was like, I got to track him down. Anyway, so the next play I did was Tennessee Williams, Night of the Iguan. I hated it. I hated the whole experience. And it was like a six-month experience where when you're in a play that you don't like and you don't feel it's working... And by the way, Tennessee Williams, arguably, people say, one of the the funniest people you ever met, but he did have this pathos, of course.

[00:28:34.320] - Speaker 1
And for this particular play, he felt like he'd accomplished his objective. If you, an audience member, felt like you'd been punched in the solar plexes before you left the theater. So it wasn't exactly a laugh a minute. And it went on for three, three and a half hours. It was long, and it was dreadful. I hated it.

[00:28:56.360] - Speaker 2
What made it the bad experience?

[00:28:58.990] - Speaker 1
What made it the bad experience?

[00:29:00.120] - Speaker 2
Was it the script that you didn't like?

[00:29:02.380] - Speaker 1
I didn't think the script was great. By the way, it won the Pulitzer in 1961 or something. It was a comeback script for Tennessee Williams. But by the way, Long Day's Journey in Tonight. To this day, Louisa went straight from the play we were in with her into Long Day's Journey with Patricia Clarkson and Brian Cox, and it was sold out. And by the way, the same director has worked with us, Jeremy. So that's another one. I've never seen it. I read it, and I was depressed for two days from reading it. And I'm just like, I don't want to do plays that make you feel bad, that make you feel sad. I will only do comedies from now on, even though this one is quite an edgy comedy, Ultra-American it's called. And it was very edgy and said some things where many nights people walked out of the theater.

[00:30:05.370] - Speaker 2
Based on the language or based on the ideas?

[00:30:07.890] - Speaker 1
Ideas. Wow. Because you didn't see the moral center. But if you didn't walk out, by the end of the play, you see, Oh, yeah, it has a moral center.

[00:30:21.620] - Speaker 2
The best work often people love it or people hate it. You know, the best work divides the That's right.

[00:30:31.220] - Speaker 1
All right. We actually got to where we were psyched when people walked out.

[00:30:37.350] - Speaker 2
You said earlier you're on stage, you're doing the play, people laughing. There was one night where it wasn't so good. Are you still in the story? Are you outside of the story and in your self questioning why it's not working?

[00:30:50.440] - Speaker 1
That's what's happening.

[00:30:51.530] - Speaker 2
So you're no longer in the play.Totally out of the play.

[00:30:53.630] - Speaker 1
Totally out of the play.

[00:30:55.750] - Speaker 2
You're commenting on or wondering about the situation.

[00:30:59.240] - Speaker 1
Well, I've developed a hate great relationship to the audience. I hate these fuckers.How do they not get how funny that was?Wow. Maybe they were right. Maybe we were off that night. But it literally was only one night And at the end of that performance, there was a standing ovation, but let's just say it was maybe two-thirds of the audience, and a third didn't stand up, which was to us, it was rough. We walked off like, what the fuck? We were just devastated. But for some reason, and by the way, a lot of Americans were there that night. It challenges, let's just say, the woke nature of America or the I mean, the play takes place in England. I'm an American, but one's English and one is Northern Irish. But it does challenge the whole the woke community, let's say.

[00:31:58.870] - Speaker 2
When it starts is not working, do you first try harder or no?

[00:32:06.620] - Speaker 1
I try not to try harder. I try to deliver the lines, the the way they're supposed to be delivered. But maybe I do push now. I don't know. By the way, this has happened to me numerous times.

[00:32:24.740] - Speaker 2
You've been doing theater for a long time.

[00:32:27.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But that's the best I ever did. David Ireland. Phenomenal, phenomenal writer. But that was the only night where there was just a disconnect right down the line. And ironically, it was a night where so many people I knew had come, which was disappointing.

[00:32:48.640] - Speaker 2
When people come, are you more nervous?

[00:32:51.440] - Speaker 1
I can't know. I make sure they don't tell me. I make sure Laura doesn't tell me. Laura makes sure it's all Well, hush, hush. Sometimes it's difficult because I'll say, Oh, I'm going to go after the play and do whatever. And she's like, Well, maybe we could just try to keep me to stay near the theater.

[00:33:15.380] - Speaker 2
So you stay neutral as best as possible for the shows?

[00:33:19.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I don't want to know. Because then I literally... If you were sitting out there, I'd be like, Okay, what did Rick think of that? I might even know where you're sitting and see you. And I'd be like, he didn't laugh at that. That would take you out of it? Shit, he didn't laugh that at all. Yeah, I just get completely out of it. I'm sure I'm not the only guy like that. A lot of people are that way.

[00:33:40.320] - Speaker 2
Have you ever had an experience where it wasn't working with the audience And that felt either okay or even good. But sometimes comedians bomb, and it has an energy of its own that's not totally negative. It's funny that I'm here telling these jokes and people are not reacting. It's almost an inside joke.

[00:34:03.820] - Speaker 1
Like Andy Kaufman. Yeah. Yeah. He was great at that. But I don't know. I'm not that type of... I like an actual physical laugh. Yeah. But I love watching some of these Andy Kaufman things that are just like-It's amazing. Nothing coming back to him. He just keeps going. That's a happening. That's a performance piece of some higher level that I can't play on that level. And by the way, I thought Jim Carrey, when he was... I don't know if you saw the doc and everything, but when he was doing... It was a Milosh Foreman picture, too. He did the one after I did with Milosh, and he was so in character, and I saw him go on shows, I think. I forget. Anyway, he'd go on talk shows and do that anti-humour humor. And boy, I mean, that's brave. That's brave.

[00:35:08.880] - Speaker 2
After the library incident, now you're working professionally, was there a first time where you felt like a feeling of a breakthrough.

[00:35:19.970] - Speaker 1
Well, that was high school. And so this is before professional. But when I was in college, I had a breakthrough because I I didn't know that I was going to be an actor. It wasn't like everything just because I did some plays. But I was in college, and I did a little part in a couple of plays in college. The best play that My freshman year, I didn't get a part in. My buddy Clint Allen, who became my best friend, and he got a part in it. He was the only freshman who got a part in it. It was called The Diviners by Jimmy Leonard Jr. And it's a masterpiece play that's been performed all over the country, high schools, colleges. It's a great play. But for me, I didn't do much in my freshman year. I mean, in other words, I did little parts, and I wasn't very good. And then I did my sophomore year. I did a part in this play called Mad Woman of Shia, French play, translated in English, though. And I played just this like a police sergeant, and I'd come in from upstage and I'd just see the mad woman there.

[00:36:44.210] - Speaker 1
Then I'd walk off downstage. So I just did a little half a loop, right? And that was my first entrance in the play. I don't say anything. Well, just generally, I felt like I was doing terrible. So I go to the guy, Doug Rogers was the lead in the play, and I said, Doug, what do I do? And he says, well, if you don't like what you're doing, change it. Do a different voice. Change your clothes, the way you walk. I did all of it. I changed the way I walked. I changed my clothes. I took his advice fully. When I did that little loop, that little half loop, the first night, there was an audience, five I have 100 people sitting there. Ovation. I come off stage and the people were like, What did you do? And I'm like, I don't know, but I'm going to do it again tomorrow. That's amazing. I started talking like this. But in that first entrance, I had that classic short pant with the white socks, and I walked funny, like a little Almost like a Penguin or something. I don't know. I was walking weird. Anyway, it had this unbelievable effect on me, this profound impact on me when I did that little nonverbal half-loop.

[00:38:19.040] - Speaker 1
And I was like, Oh, I love this. I love this. It was like your whole thing about creativity. I don't know where that creativity he comes from. But prior to talking to Doug Rogers and him encouraging me to try stuff, I wasn't really being creative. I was saying the lines, and I was boring as fuck. But when I finally took it upon myself to get creatively invested in the guy, suddenly it went great. And so that was a lesson that hopefully I kept using after that. Not always.

[00:39:02.580] - Speaker 2
So when you're doing comedy in a movie and there's no audience, how do you judge what works?

[00:39:12.050] - Speaker 1
Well, usually from the crew.

[00:39:16.230] - Speaker 2
The crew laughs?

[00:39:17.580] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the crew will laugh. I mean, they can't laugh while you're rolling, but if they like it at the end of it, you hear it. Not always. So Man, I'll tell you, thank God for the crew. Because otherwise, I mean, I'm really that guy who needs an audience. Before I know, did that work? I mean, I don't know. Did that work? I don't know. I get very at the end of the take, I'll be like, if the crew didn't react or anything, I'm like, well, to the director, I don't know if that worked. That didn't work, did it? Should I try something? Yeah.

[00:39:59.670] - Speaker 2
Do you think of yourself as a comedic actor?

[00:40:06.270] - Speaker 1
I know that that's what I prefer to be. I'll do a drama if it's great, but I much prefer making people laugh. That's great.

[00:40:17.120] - Speaker 2
Have you ever done improv?

[00:40:19.710] - Speaker 1
I didn't improv. Well, I do improv while doing movies and such. Do a good deal of improv. So adlibbing. Adlibbing. But also improvising big chunks. In a lot of the movies like Larry Flint, White Men Can't Jump, Natural Born Kill. I mean, there's a lot of these... I really think there's value in it because even if it doesn't work, you might find that one little bit that worked great. And also it just feels more real because it's you thinking and you... I mean, that doesn't negate the need for a great script. You can't just improvise a great- Does that improvisation happen in the moment, or do you think of it in advance? Well, that's not really improv, but yes, that does happen. I remember working on when I did King Pen, and Bill Murray would be in between every take. He'd sit there and he'd have a pen and he'd be thinking, writing shit down. He's not hanging out talking. He's working. He's coming with new ideas. And then I'm doing the same thing. And those times I haven't, shame on me.

[00:41:39.670] - Speaker 2
Have you ever broken character and laughed?

[00:41:41.770] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, all the time. Speaking of, with Bill Murray, he's probably caused it more than any other person.

[00:41:49.770] - Speaker 2
Just makes you laugh. Can't stop.

[00:41:51.450] - Speaker 1
So funny. I just can't not laugh. I remember Zambi land. How many takes we ruined? Because So me and Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone, we're all laughing. It's very hard to not laugh at Bill Murray. I mean, he's just... He's such a high level of funny. But as for actual improv, getting up on stage doing improv, I did go. It was in Ireland. There were several great stand-up and also improv comedians there. And so They were doing a show, and they said, Do you want to come and get up? Well, I got up. I can tell you I was terrible. I mean, terrible. I was just too nervous. And you're among people who are just so great at their craft. And this is a craft that really... I don't think... Even though I'm good at improv in that situation of, say, doing a movie where you're on set, and I tend to be good at that, this is a whole another level when there's an audience right there. And then I hadn't learned the whole yes and. I didn't know anything about... At least I've studied it in the sense of I've learned about it.

[00:43:16.660] - Speaker 1
And what's his name? Del...

[00:43:18.480] - Speaker 2
Del Close.

[00:43:19.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I've studied it because it's a fascinating thing to me. But I would never get up on stage and improvise now because I know I can't. I mean, I could if I probably... If I took a class and worked it.

[00:43:33.340] - Speaker 2
It would just take work.

[00:43:34.420] - Speaker 1
It just takes work. Yeah, did the work. But if not, I could never do that.

[00:43:38.460] - Speaker 2
In a movie where there are a lot of takes, how different would your performance be from take to take? Funny.

[00:43:46.740] - Speaker 1
I was just working on this thing. They're having a 50th anniversary of Hustler magazine, and they wanted me to do a forward for Larry, who I tell you what, I really came to love this guy.

[00:44:03.320] - Speaker 2
You got to meet him?

[00:44:04.950] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Because as I say in the thing, I was really torn because I grew up in Texas, but then we moved to Ohio when I was 12. And then I'm in Ohio. And while I was there, this obsenity trial happened for Larry Clinton. You talk about when the press decides to go after somebody and all the press is negative. Well, you just absorb it. You can't help but think they're right. It's the devil incarnate. You know what I mean? So I absorbed all that because I was right there near Cincinnati where he was having his obsenity trial. So when the time came and I got offered by one of the greatest directors of all time, Milosh Foreman, to do the part, and I was like, Jesus, this is a quandary. I got to go meet them. If I like them, I'll do it. If I don't like them, I won't do it. So I went up to Larry Front enterprises up there at the penthouse of this Wilshire and La Ciena Yeah, around there. And I went up to those offices, and I met him. And within five minutes, I'm like, not only am I doing the movie, I think this is one of the most unique, incredible humans I've I've ever met.

[00:45:31.540] - Speaker 1
Honesty, I've never seen from anyone.

[00:45:34.750] - Speaker 2
What do you know about his story?

[00:45:36.720] - Speaker 1
Well, he grew up in Kentucky, and his parents, they did MoonShine. And he grew up dirt poor. I mean, poor. Him and Jimmy Flint, they were extremely poor. And he was looking at a playboy, and he was like, It just looks so fake. And not some degree authenticity that they're losing with this. And he'd already had these little clubs where he'd had dancers. But then he decided to start Hustler magazine. It became successful, and it became a real political tool for him. There's a lot about that magazine I don't like, but there's also a lot I admire because he was bold and he was fighting for First Amendment rights. And he's saying, Hey, they take it away from me. They'll take it away from you. And you look how it's... Now you have the Trusted News Initiative. It's called TNI, Trusted News Initiative. Now, it began the last election. It started with the BBC, but then all Western media, all mainstream media, and also worldwide, joined on this initiative, try to keep foreign influence out of the election, particularly, obviously, Russia. Well, who couldn't agree that that's a good idea? But then after the election, they didn't just disband.

[00:47:12.410] - Speaker 1
Then they started focusing on other things. Anything that promoted vaccine hesitancy, anything that questioned the COVID narrative of how people were getting sick, anything that at question 5G. There are certain major areas like that where any of those things will not be in mainstream media, period. Excised. And I can't tell you how many videos I sent to friends. Man, this is incredible. Watch this video because it's someone debunking the way they're either debunking the vaccine or the COVID narrative and gone. Before they could watch it, it was already gone, right? All over mainstream media, everywhere, you see it. To this day, you won't hear one positive thing said about Bobby Kennedy Jr. Nothing. Not a word in mainstream media. But you'll see negative. Usually, they don't mention them at all. But when they mention them, it's negative. It's like a worm in the brain. He said the worm in the brain thing, he was... What do you call it? A deposition. And the lawyer was asking him about his voice impediment or something. And he said that a doctor had made some suppositions among them, maybe it has to do with a parasite in the brain.

[00:48:52.370] - Speaker 1
He didn't say it. He's saying...

[00:48:54.670] - Speaker 2
That the doctor said it to him.

[00:48:55.800] - Speaker 1
In the deposition that the doctor said... And now people think he just recently said this thing, I got a worm in my brain. And then they ridicule him. Well, that's the way the mainstream media works now. It's all a part of the TNI has become censorship at the highest level. I mean, worldwide.

[00:49:16.740] - Speaker 2
How did you first meet Bobby Kennedy?

[00:49:19.370] - Speaker 1
I met him on a plane, and he ridiculed my... I had hemp shoes on. This is many years ago. They probably were ugly, but then that started this in a little...He made fun of your shoes? Yeah. That's great.Made in front of my shoes. And then he and I had a little tourist exchange. And then we ended up becoming friends, and that was a five-hour flight. So by the end of it, we were on good terms.

[00:49:50.470] - Speaker 2
Larry Flint was the first person that you came across who was portrayed in a negative way in the media. And then you met him and you realized you weren't getting a straight story.

[00:50:02.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah, for sure. That was a straight shooter, an honest man. Whether you like pornography, you hate pornography, whether you think a pornographer is, this was one of the most honest guys I ever met, he would just tell it like it is.

[00:50:19.990] - Speaker 2
Was he in the wheelchair when you met him?

[00:50:21.960] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:50:22.910] - Speaker 2
How did that happen?

[00:50:24.310] - Speaker 1
Well, it actually was shortly after he offered a million dollars for any information leading to the JFK assassination. They tried to assassinate him.

[00:50:37.740] - Speaker 2
Why was he interested in that?

[00:50:39.560] - Speaker 1
He was interested in all kinds of political stuff. He was bold, and he was a thorn in the side of the state. Anyway, so shortly after that, they tried to assassinate him. And the only reason he didn't die is because he had been fasting for two days because otherwise, because it shot into his intestine, and it would have leaked and just... It would have killed him. At least this is what the doctor said at the time, but that he was fasting. But it did hit his... It caused a nerve damage. Then he was in excruciating pain. The doctors decided to cut that nerve to get rid of the pain, but then there was never a chance that he would walk again after that. Wow.

[00:51:38.900] - Speaker 2
Did they ever catch the assassin?

[00:51:41.420] - Speaker 1
Well, someone admitted to it. Someone who was already in prison for life admitted to it. You find the government makes this happen quite a lot. I'm not saying the government was involved, but I think the government was involved. Yeah. Wow. A lot of times someone who's in prison, they're not getting out anyway. You find they'll be, Oh, yeah, I did that. That was me.

[00:52:06.080] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Milosh.

[00:52:08.440] - Speaker 1
Milosh was one of the great directors I've ever worked with and one of the great directors, I think, who's ever lived up there with the true greats like Scorsese. He was great. He was like a papa bear. Woody, give me a hug in the morning. And just It's like, had that, like I say, that family. And this was a dysfunctional family. Yeah. Courtney Love and Ed Norton.

[00:52:39.300] - Speaker 2
And how was the experience of making that movie?

[00:52:45.340] - Speaker 1
It's one of the great experiences for sure I ever had. And I still love Courtney and Ed. And so I feel like maybe that could be the best movie I ever made. And it might, at the end of my life, be the best movie I ever made. I got to work with one of the goats. Yeah.

[00:53:10.020] - Speaker 2
How different are the different directors you've gotten to work with? You got to work with so many interesting people.

[00:53:18.250] - Speaker 1
They're all quite different. But I feel like the greatest ones are very open to, Okay, let's try this. Milos let me... There was a whole scene that he let me direct and edit. I was in the editing bay. And not only that, it was like where Larry Flint is talking about, Oh, obsinity. They say, This is obscene. A woman's breast or whatever. But meanwhile, you can watch murder all day long on television, or this is okay. And show a scene from Vietnam, which at that point I think it was just after Vietnam. Vietnam ended in '75. So obviously, he's going to have the last say on everything, but he let me put this whole thing together because it's Larry Flint on a stage, and there's these images behind him. And so what those images were. I actually went as far as negotiating with agents of photographers. Can we use How much? But what I was going to say was, because you originally asked me how different these improvised things end up being, how different a scene will be. And there's a scene where I propose to Courtney's character, she played Althea Flint, and we're in a Jacuzzi.

[00:54:52.580] - Speaker 1
And I had been very anxious about the fact that the scene was going to be shot just one camera one way. But we were used to improvising because that was the thing Milos got me doing is he got me with countless actresses, like Holly Hunter, to me, she's like a titan. All these different actresses came in, and I would act with them, and we'd improvise stuff, and we'd try stuff. And it was many months before we finally shot it. So that when that scene, he finally showed me three completely different scenes of the proposal. So it did change quite a bit. And my God, was it a blissful experience. It's like, to me, you talk about in your book about that whole creative thing. There was so much creative energy in that movie, from actors to DP to director. I don't know. I felt like it really... I love how it turned out. I haven't seen it in a long time.

[00:56:07.360] - Speaker 2
It speaks to Milosch's self-confidence. He knew he could allow you to try something and go as far as you could with it, but he wasn't afraid of trying something new.

[00:56:23.460] - Speaker 1
He was that guy. He was so confident about that thing. So So he just wasn't risk averse, as you might say.

[00:56:34.670] - Speaker 2
Did Larry get to see the movie, finished?

[00:56:37.140] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. He loved it.

[00:56:39.910] - Speaker 2
He did? Yeah. That's great.

[00:56:42.490] - Speaker 1
It was a beautiful film. It was like a lot of it having to do with his love for Alphia.

[00:56:49.230] - Speaker 2
How is it different playing a real person versus a fictional character?

[00:56:56.990] - Speaker 1
Definitely put somewhat of a burden of I remember because there was an obsenity trial in Cincinnati, and Larry played the judge, who, by the way, he hated this guy. He was a terrible, very conservative, prejudiced judge, right? So I just got a little self-conscious being Larry in front of Larry. But, yeah, it turned out good.

[00:57:32.120] - Speaker 2
Have you ever had to compete to get a part?

[00:57:35.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:57:36.430] - Speaker 2
What's that like?

[00:57:38.320] - Speaker 1
Well, I mean, that's the whole beginning of every actor's career. You're lucky if eventually you don't have to audition anymore. But auditioning, that is a whole another animal. I had a hard time with it. The times that I was finally able to break free had to do with artificial means Like, for example, when I was auditioning for the first major, major audition that did really help change the course of my life was for Biloxi Blues, Neil Simon. And without getting into a lot of detail, I had a terrible fight. Anyway, I was leaving New New York, right? Then I was going to go back to Ohio and write a play. And then with that play, I was going to come back to New York. A lot of people had this dream. But anyway, that's what I finally I'd had it. New York, one. New York, one, I lost. I was going back to where my mom was living in Lebanon, Ohio. Now, I had an agent at that point. Getting the agent It was a very tough deal. But she sent me on one last audition, and that audition was for a Neil Simon play, Biloxi Blues.

[00:59:11.840] - Speaker 1
And when I went in to audition for the casting person, I didn't know that Neil Simon was sitting in the back of the... Because I was auditioning for an understudy role. Like, what playwright of his renown is going to be sitting in the theater watching? Well, Well, luckily, he was. And so it went well. And by the way, it only went well because I'm out of here. You know what I mean? I'm leaving. I give up. I'm done. There's nothing you can do to me.

[00:59:43.840] - Speaker 2
That's really interesting.

[00:59:45.350] - Speaker 1
It's really crucial. The other time it happened was equally crucial. But anyway, so then I get called back in. I was understanding two roles, and I got to say, I did well. And then later that day, they called me, You got it. And every one of those people were looking at their... Whoever they were understanding, and they might have been quite pissed off. Many of them felt they could do better than the person. Me, I was happy as could be. I auditioned for the Understudy. I got the Understudy. And by the way, both of those guys are doing that part better than I could do it.Wow.So I was happy. And then the other time was when I auditioned for Cheers, because at that point, I told you I'd been doing the play, and I got a little sabbatical from the play to go do the Goldie Hawn movie, and someone filled in for me. And then both of the guys got fired, who I was understudying in the Neil Simon play. They got fired. It was on Broadway in the Neil Simon Theater, right? It was my dream. Also, I was a fanatical fan, and still am, of Neil Simon.

[01:01:09.300] - Speaker 1
So they got fired, and they called me, Can you going to be able to come back and play the part? Oh, yeah, baby. I was 23. It was my dream come true to be on Broadway, Neil Simon play. Well, then I auditioned for Cheers. If I got it, great. But I'm already going to be on on Broadway. It didn't matter to me. I didn't realize what a huge life change it was going to be and how important it would be to my... I can't imagine that not having been in my life now. But at the time, I was like, no problem.

[01:01:45.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm doing this other thing.

[01:01:46.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I'll go do Broadway. That's my dream anyway. I don't want to do television. So when I went in for that audition, I was really free. But it was funny, the audition. It was Laurie opened them was the casting person there at Paramount. She worked for MBC. But anyway, I went in and I auditioned for her, and I could tell she was like, whoa. Now, they'd almost cast a guy. He was pretty much locked in. He was going to play Woody. But I went in, and like I said, what do I care?I'm.

[01:02:23.850] - Speaker 2
Sad.nothing to lose.

[01:02:25.080] - Speaker 1
I'm said, Nothing to lose. And by the way, that's the The thing that kills people in auditions is their desperation. But when you go in and you got nothing to lose, so is it freeing? It's like freeing yourself from the inertia of, I got to get this. And then I did well with Laurie, and she's like, Can you come with me? And I follow her. We went through a door, and it seemed like we went through another door. And I don't know when we're going into the room with the people. Couple, which ended up being Jimmy Burrows and the Charles brothers and everybody. And just before we entered that room, I had a runny nose. And as she opens the door going into the room, from blowing my nose. And the entire room just burst out laughing. Amazing. And it was a complete mistake. I mean, it was accidental. And Jimmy told me later, You had the part that moment. You had the part.

[01:03:31.170] - Speaker 2
Had to blow your nose. The universe was intervening.

[01:03:35.770] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. Amazing. Don't you feel like there's a universal intervention with creative acts?

[01:03:41.940] - Speaker 2
Absolutely all the time. And when you When you come to realize that's what it is, you start seeing it happens all the time. If you're not paying attention, it'll just go by because business as usual. But when you pay attention, so many little details that It would have gone a different way just fall into place.

[01:04:04.770] - Speaker 1
But the not paying attention is like, distraction by fear or doubt. Yeah. Right? Those are the things that keep you out of that creative flow.

[01:04:18.960] - Speaker 2
How much of your life outside of your work informs your work?

[01:04:26.340] - Speaker 1
I think there are some people who live in a bubble, but I do feel like I get a lot of time among just regular folks. So I feel like it is important to not be too trapped inside your bubble. Sure, you're going to have a bit of a bubble just because of the nature of... We're in a very rarefied air. We're lucky. I remember seeing a guy, oh, yeah, recently in Copenhagen. He was working. So he was being pulled away to work. But I just wanted to keep talking to him because I'm like, there are things this guy is doing that I have to... This is a character. You know what I mean?

[01:05:14.260] - Speaker 2
You can get cues out in the world if you're paying attention. If you're not open to it, it'll all just go by. But it's always there.

[01:05:27.720] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's like a classic example is when Mick Jagger was in line, or I don't forget if it was him or Keith Richard. They were in line, and they get up to the thing, and they asked for something that they didn't have. And the guy goes, You can't always Get what you want. He's like, Yeah, that's not bad. Good phrase.

[01:05:50.820] - Speaker 2
Can you think of any examples of something that you saw out in the world that ended up happening in one of your characters?

[01:05:58.600] - Speaker 1
Oh, my God. It's It happened a lot. I remember one time I was following my brother on the motorcycle, and then we got to wherever we were going, and he took off his helmet, and he had this long blonde hair down to almost his shoulders. And he shook his head. And I'm like, And I had just gotten the part for Hamish for Hunger Games. And I was like, That's the hair. Luckily with me, I can have anything. Any hair you want. Or no hair at all. Of course, I can do that. But just things people say or Yeah, I use that stuff all the time. I find little things all the time that are helpful out in the world.

[01:06:56.610] - Speaker 2
In the middle of a performance, are you Are you aware of what you're doing technically, or do you just disappear into the character?

[01:07:07.810] - Speaker 1
No, if I'm aware, I'm fucked.

[01:07:11.350] - Speaker 2
You're just in it?

[01:07:13.300] - Speaker 1
I'm just in it. I don't want something to be preordained. I know you're that way. I know you're like, you don't want to get bogged down in the technical. You're in the creative. You're a listener.

[01:07:29.920] - Speaker 2
If you're reading a script that you know you're going to do, what's the process of preparing from an early script read till you get to the point of playing your character? What are all the things that you do?

[01:07:44.780] - Speaker 1
Whatever the profession is, I might study that profession as much as possible. Maybe I'll play this truck driver, so I'd probably go hang out with truck drivers. I'd study, read any book Looked at about truck drivers, talking to the designer about clothes and how this would work. And what about a scar for... I don't know. It's not necessarily a scar for a truck driver. But what about this hat or that? Just start thinking of the external things that maybe I want to talk just a little different. I might want to try some funny shit with the way I talk or the way I... I don't know. I just try to get into the head space of a truck driver in this case. So in that sense, I might read a dozen books. I remember when I was playing in Natural Born Killers. I studied all those motherfuckers, Gacy, and Manson, and read his autobiography, saw a documentary after documentary, everything I could try to... And that was an unpleasant time. I didn't like it at all. But they all have a commonality. They all had fucked up unloved childhoods, all of them. And I imagine all those people today who commit the school shootings, they never got any love, not at home, not at school.

[01:09:29.130] - Speaker 1
And they just developed this hate toward everybody. But just try to get in the headspace.

[01:09:37.330] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of Natural Born Killers.

[01:09:40.150] - Speaker 1
Well, it was weird because I was on Cheers. I was on the final season of Cheers.

[01:09:49.380] - Speaker 2
I didn't realize that it was that close to Cheers.

[01:09:52.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I was cast while I was still on Cheers.

[01:09:54.730] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:09:55.710] - Speaker 1
And all I'd done that he might have seen was Hold on, let me think. Yeah, he could have seen White Men Can't Jump. What hadn't come out yet was Indecent Proposal. But he might have seen now White Men Can't Jump, and he certainly had seen Cheers, but there was no real logic to him casting me. But he just said something in my eyes where he thought I could be a convincing serial killer.

[01:10:26.240] - Speaker 2
Do you remember your first meeting with Oliver?

[01:10:29.080] - Speaker 1
Well, I had I met Oliver years before because he was doing this first movie, the movie that made him a celebrated director. And he was auditioning people. And this is before I'd done anything. And I came in and he brought me in a few times. And he had me do improv and different things. And then the money fell out. And by the time he finally got the money together, I was on Cheers. And I came in And he was like, This is how the meeting went. I'm sitting there and he goes, You're doing a television show. And I'm like, Yeah, cheers. He goes, But then you're not available. What are you doing in my office? I'm like, Okay. And I literally, Okay, sorry. Good meeting. Left. That was the next time I'd met him after those earlier audition. Then later on, I get word he wants me to be in Natural Born Killers. And I remember like a year before, having been greatly enamored of him as a director. I mean, I thought JFK was just a freaking masterpiece. Well, not to mention everything he does. Phenomenal. Masterpiece. And I'd seen he was on the cover of Newsweek just to show you how the censorship works in America.

[01:12:03.000] - Speaker 1
And it was like, it said JFK, but it had a picture of him and JFK and something where he was doubting the verisimilitude of what was in the movie in the front page of Newsweek, I believe it was. Anyway, he was sitting on that table. We were living in Malibu at the time. And I remember looking at Laura going, God, I'd love to work with that guy. And then it was only like two years later. I get a thing and he wants me to do it. And boy, was I psyched to work with him.

[01:12:43.610] - Speaker 2
I bet.

[01:12:44.300] - Speaker 1
I felt like the script needed a lot of work. It was a Quentin Tarantino script, which I do admire Quentin Tarantino, but that particular script, it had some issues.

[01:12:53.570] - Speaker 2
Was that his first script?

[01:12:55.950] - Speaker 1
No, I think he'd done other scripts, but he wasn't Quentin Tarantino yet.

[01:13:01.130] - Speaker 2
He hadn't directed anything yet.

[01:13:02.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I don't think he'd done his big debut. But as soon as we wrap Cheers, the final episode, Indecent Proposed puzzle came out, and I started working on natural-born killers all at the same time.

[01:13:22.020] - Speaker 2
It's an unbelievable trajectory because at that point in time, going from television to movies didn't happen so often.

[01:13:29.990] - Speaker 1
No. In fact, I was six years where I couldn't get anything.

[01:13:34.760] - Speaker 2
You were thought of as a TV actor.

[01:13:38.730] - Speaker 1
Well, also a very specific... I played dumb characters in my own view, naive. But trusting. I'm playing these characters, a specific type of character, and I'm on, obviously, a very popular show. And even like friends, you expect every one of those guys to go on to big careers because they were all fucking great. So it just shows of how the difficulty of the transition. I mean, even to this day, it's tough. It's rare. But back then, it was very rare. Guys like Michael J. Fox and Bruce Willis and Michael Douglas had done it. But it was like, literally, it was a handful of people.

[01:14:33.680] - Speaker 2
Are you aware of any practices you do that you don't know any other actors who do?

[01:14:40.660] - Speaker 1
No, I think everybody upstages. And everybody, a lot of people chew the scenery. No, I don't have any... I can't say I do anything unique, but my belief about acting acting is... It's like you talk about in your book. Everybody has that creative instinct. It's in all of us. Question is, how do you clear the path? So I feel like the same is true for acting. You just think how many interesting people there are. And, oh, if they can only do that when a camera is rolling. But what happens is they say rolling, and this to me Immediately, the sphincter goes... It's the nervousness and the fear and the doubting and all of those understandable emotions that come up that keep a person from necessarily being able to do what they could do. And my suggestion, for example, my daughter, right? Now, I have three daughters, and each one of them have tried their hand at acting. And I will say, there's nothing you want less than your child to go into this profession. You know there's going to be disappointment, and just sometimes it's going to be heartbreaking. But she's going for it. And the thing I feel with her is like, Hey, do yoga.

[01:16:26.720] - Speaker 1
The big thing you need to do is just to be as relaxed as as you can so you can be in a state of basically dynamic relaxation where you're active but also relaxed at the same time. And you might be in a very intense scene, but there's underneath it, the root of it has a certain relaxation element. And I do feel like that's a crucial thing. Whenever they're rolling and I'm just tense, it just It doesn't fucking work, man.

[01:17:02.330] - Speaker 2
Have you gotten better at being able to be relaxed in any situation?

[01:17:06.290] - Speaker 1
Definitely. Yeah.

[01:17:07.570] - Speaker 2
And it just comes with time, right?

[01:17:10.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, even back when I first went on Cheers in the very first scene, I come out. Now I'm conscious of the fact that I'm replacing this beloved actor, nick Calisanto, who had died, which is the only reason I'm able to do this part. And I'm waiting off stage. And it's also a beloved show, beloved actor, one of the most, maybe the heart of the show, according to Ted Danson. And I'm waiting for the red light off stage. He tells me to walk into the bar. And I'm talking, the level of nerves is insanity.

[01:17:59.920] - Speaker 2
Insane.

[01:18:00.580] - Speaker 1
And also it's 500 people or more in the audience, the live audience, not to mention there's going to be a million watching it at home later. So the pressure was crazy. And if it hadn't been for my theater experience and doing all those plays in college, I couldn't have done it. I mean, I just couldn't have done it if I didn't have that backbone, like you say, just the work.

[01:18:32.660] - Speaker 2
What's the most you've ever had to change your sofa a character that you played, either physically or having to learn something difficult?

[01:18:44.350] - Speaker 1
It might have been LBJ because there was a good deal of prosthetics, which I thought they did a good job with the prosthetics. But it's ironic because he's also a Texan, but he was from the hill country. Just even though...Different accent. Yeah, he was a different accent, even though it's so similar because it's still Texan. But oh, my God, that used to mess with me, like trying to get his The way he would talk in his cadence and everything and try to move like him. Oh, my God.

[01:19:20.570] - Speaker 2
Would you listen to recordings of him? Is that the way to do it?Constant.

[01:19:24.310] - Speaker 1
When I'm in the makeup chair every single day, it I'd listen to his phone calls because he recorded all of his phone calls. The only call that got erased was the very first day that he was in office, November 22nd, 1963, between him and J.

[01:19:49.590] - Speaker 2
Edgar Hoover.Right after the assassination.Yeah..

[01:19:52.730] - Speaker 1
That day's missing. He came to the oval office, and he had a conversation with Hoover, which was recorded. And He was the only one deleted. But he did have a conversation with them seven days later, where he was talking about forming the Warren Commission, which was a method to get rid of the Senate and House investigations. There was two investigations that were going on, and they managed to get rid of those because they started the Warren Commission. And the Warren Commission, and at the time of that phone call, which was literally one week later, the FBI report was on his desk. So what is that? Six days they'd done it because this was the seventh, this is 29th. And there was that report on his desk saying, Oh, Mohn Gunman, This one crazy guy spent a lot of time in Russia. And the Warren Commission was just to rubber stamp that. And who controlled that? It wasn't chief Warren. Earl Warren was busy with the Supreme Court. No. Alan Dulles created the CIA and certainly influential, and shall we say, the demise of JFK. But anyway, in the course of that conversation, when I listened to that, I was like, oh, LBJ was definitely involved.

[01:21:25.310] - Speaker 1
No question. I listened to that many times, but I know I got off base because I always like to just say how fucked our government is. But anyway, yeah, I used to listen constantly to them. And that was what was actually harder. Would have been easier to speak with a French accent or something just because-It was close. It was too close. And these little jumps. Oh, well, he says this like that instead of... That took a lot of work. But I love that film, Rob Reiner. I love it. I think he did a great job.

[01:22:04.740] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Rob Reiner. What was it like working with him?

[01:22:07.170] - Speaker 1
He's amazing, man. I'm nuts about Rob Reiner.

[01:22:11.340] - Speaker 2
Did Rob believe that LBJ was involved?

[01:22:17.440] - Speaker 1
I don't recall him ever saying that. I don't think he did. And by the way, it was well after I was committed before I developed that belief for I don't think I would have done it. Yeah.

[01:22:32.750] - Speaker 2
Did you play him like you might have done it?

[01:22:34.770] - Speaker 1
No, I didn't. I did not. There's a part of me that wanted to address the elephant in the room, but it just would have made it a whole nother movie. That's not what the movie was at. The movie was about LVJ did some good shit. He got the Voting Rights Act through. He was a guy who got shit done. He was the head of the Senate for so long, and he was a true political operator. And then, of course, he became, when he was vice President to JFK, he didn't like JFK, and the Kennedy's didn't like him.

[01:23:13.900] - Speaker 2
But they were put together so that JFK could win.

[01:23:16.710] - Speaker 1
Was that part of it? Well, it was JFK's idea, I believe, because JFK knew he needed the south, and he thought LBJ could deliver the south. But once LBJ became vice President, And all of his power went away, and he just became almost ignored. You know what I mean? He was ignored by the Kennedy, certainly. But he did unbelievable legislation once he became President. He got a lot of shit through.

[01:23:45.590] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the types of conversations you have with a director.

[01:23:53.140] - Speaker 1
It's usually in the beginning about the script. I always take notes on scripts, and I I think good notes. I'm constantly reading every day, every single day, usually several times throughout the day, I'm reading books, but I also-What books do you read? Just all kinds of books, all kinds. Like right now, I'm reading... Well, I'm reading two books. I'm reading Interviews with Fulani, but I'm also reading this book. It's called The Russian Tradition, which is really fascinating. I've learned a lot already. But that's more of a historical. I like reading historical stuff or biographies.

[01:24:40.220] - Speaker 2
What percentage of the things you read are for work versus not?

[01:24:45.340] - Speaker 1
If I'm getting ready to work, it's all that.

[01:24:48.240] - Speaker 2
But if you don't have a job to prepare for in that moment, you're free and just read what's interesting to you? Yeah. Tell me the extremes of your involvement in a project beyond the acting performance.

[01:25:02.560] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm very involved in the script. If the script is great, Hallelujah. But frequently, there's a lot needs doing with the script.

[01:25:12.770] - Speaker 2
Would you ask questions? Why is this character saying this or what's supposed to be happening here? Or this plot point doesn't work?

[01:25:21.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah, all of that. I did a movie with Will Smith, and Will Smith Probably one of the most impressive careers in terms of just going from success to success. I mean, probably no one has a better career than Tom Cruise or Leo DiCaprio, but almost there. Success to success. When I worked with him, he was always about... When we were doing rehearsal, what can we do to get more emotional charge into this scene. He's just really smart that way and relentless in terms of his pursuit. That's great. And that affected me. I want to always figure out how this scene could be better if we just Why don't we see this thing? It happens offstate. That's interesting. Those things. When you see a lot of scripts, so many scripts over the years, eventually you start to get a handle on what it is it might need.

[01:26:32.540] - Speaker 2
By the time you're shooting the first scene of a movie, would you say you have your character completely worked out, or might he still change as the shooting goes on?

[01:26:44.180] - Speaker 1
I don't know if it's not worked out or it's just complete doubt. The night before I shoot any movie, I'm flattered with doubt. I'm awake through the night. And I mean, it's still, I'm 63 years old, right? What the... I don't even understand it myself. How the fuck am I still so insecure?

[01:27:05.440] - Speaker 2
It's because you want it to be good.

[01:27:07.020] - Speaker 1
That's why you want it to be good. Yeah.

[01:27:10.530] - Speaker 2
And it's scary. You're not free. You care about the outcome, so you're invested.

[01:27:16.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:27:18.520] - Speaker 2
So you have doubt that first day. Does the doubt go away at the end of the first day, typically?

[01:27:24.430] - Speaker 1
It usually starts to diminish after the first take. And then after a few takes, I might be completely calmed down by the time we get that first take in the can. Amazing. And then after the next day, I might have a little more. And then by the third day or something, there's my old somewhat confident self. Discipates fast. I'm starting to work in a week, right? I know. And this is a sequel that I've done two others. It's now you see me three. And it's just like, I love the same character, most of the same cast. But I know that the night before I won't sleep, I'll be tossing and turning. I'll be freaking out, and I'll be completely well-versed with the scene I'm about to shoot, but I'll just be... I don't know why, but it just something in me.

[01:28:25.740] - Speaker 2
And that's probably the best version of it when you've already worked on two, you're showing up to something very familiar.

[01:28:34.010] - Speaker 1
Well, the character is familiar, but the scene is obviously unique. And I guess that's where the trepidation.

[01:28:42.640] - Speaker 2
How was Are you doing sequels or are you doing trilogies different than a first-time movie?

[01:28:50.770] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, like I did the Hunger Games, I got to do four movies. I mean, you eventually do adopt a great familiarity with the other actors, the director, maybe, if it's the same director. This is not the same director for Now You See Me 3, but I've worked with him several times, Ruben Fleischer, and he's phenomenal. He did zombie land one and two. Great. He did the first Venom. He cast me in that. Great. He's great. So your trust in the director is a lot of what mollifies that trepidation. And the other actors. Jesse Eisenberg, man, that guy's a fucking genius, man. He's a genius. He's so great. I love him. Love him. So I'm psyched to see him, Dave Franco. No, it's going to be a great experience.

[01:29:52.070] - Speaker 2
What are your all-time favorite movies?

[01:29:56.300] - Speaker 1
My all-time favorite movie is Cool Hand Luke. I don't know why. A guy who's been wronged by the system, a rebel.

[01:30:08.320] - Speaker 2
How old were you when you first saw it?

[01:30:11.210] - Speaker 1
Jeez, I don't know. I think I must have been...Kid. Yeah, in my teens.

[01:30:18.450] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of the movie that you directed that was all shot in one night. What's it called?Lost.

[01:30:26.440] - Speaker 1
In London.Tell.

[01:30:27.480] - Speaker 2
Me the story from the beginning.

[01:30:29.180] - Speaker 1
I I'd been writing on that Lost in London, and I'd also been writing on this other thing, which I never have followed through on yet, called The Misadventures of Mr. Fitts, because I still have to rewrite the last third of that movie. But what I liked about the idea of doing that is I thought... I became mystified and fascinated by these one-take movies like Veronica, because I'm fascinated by theater. I'm fascinated by a sidewalk painting. You see that sidewalk painting? They're going to wash that away. It won't be there tomorrow. So you're just seeing in the moment something that is unique. So I came to think that how cool it would be because I saw a way that I could do this Lost in in one take. It was based on stuff that had actually happened to me in London, including getting arrested and some stuff with the tablet. Different things happened, and all of it I could see how you could make it into, well, at least one take. And then it became, well, I was thinking multiple cameras, but then it'd be like, no, one camera. So it became a one camera thing And then I was sitting talking with my buddy, Tom Cartsotis, and Tom goes, Wait, why don't you just shoot it and livestream it into theaters while it happens?

[01:32:12.920] - Speaker 1
Well, this had never been done before.

[01:32:14.930] - Speaker 2
I didn't even know it could be done.

[01:32:16.860] - Speaker 1
Well, it couldn't because I went to different people and they were all saying, No, it can't be done. No, you can do like they'd had the thing where you're showing up.

[01:32:27.570] - Speaker 2
A boxing match, a pay-per-view.

[01:32:29.890] - Speaker 1
Well, yeah, like that. But certainly also in the theater where you're seeing a play, but that's all in one location.

[01:32:37.460] - Speaker 2
Filming the performance of a stage play.

[01:32:39.760] - Speaker 1
Of a stage play and live streamed into a theater while doing it. But that's a whole different thing because this had 14 different locations. This had five different vehicles, a police van.A lot to go wrong.A lot could go wrong.A lot to go wrong. Also, there was something to do with Line site where if you're outdoors, you need to be able... The antenna needs to get to the big antenna on top of this building in order To be able to stream it live.Stream it live into the United States to shot it like three in the morning. And so the sound thing was fucked. It just wasn't working. And also, even the live feed the night before we shot went out for 45 minutes. If this happens tomorrow, we're done. It's a disaster. The same thing with the The sound just never got worked out. And then finally, at the last minute, my buddy Ant did the music, which also had to be played in live, even though it recorded stuff, but played in live. And sometimes he would add stuff to it live.

[01:33:46.530] - Speaker 2
You didn't do it to a stopwatch, or did you?

[01:33:49.360] - Speaker 1
We'd only had a run through twice before. We did two the night before. That's what it was. I see. And then we did... The one. That night. Yeah. Yeah, I was freaking out. I said, Ant, find the guy who is the guy, the sound guy who can figure out this thing. There was like a pack, and that was carried on the back. It had all these different antennas shooting out. But the guy who was the camera guy had that on his back. And then if we got into a taxi, whatever, then he gets in on the other side. All this technical shit was Eventually, it was affecting my health. He's not able to sleep. And it was very, very difficult.

[01:34:39.050] - Speaker 2
How long did you have to plan it for it to be able to make it happen in that one shot? Two months. Yeah.

[01:34:44.290] - Speaker 1
I mean, there was a lot of work on the script up to the beginning of that two-month period, the rehearsal and then the cameras following and all of that. It was a couple of months. Then the day when we're going to do it that night in the late afternoon, we were using Waterloo Bridge for the final scene. Very important. And we had cops helping us and stuff. But they say, We've discovered an unexploded World War II ordinance, a bomb right next to Waterloo Bridge. They're shutting down the bridge.

[01:35:27.920] - Speaker 2
The bridge that's been open since since World War II.

[01:35:31.280] - Speaker 1
Since World War II.is being shut down today.It's not being shut down hours before, well, whatever, maybe eight hours before we're filming or seven hours before we're filming. And I'm like, what?

[01:35:41.370] - Speaker 2
That's insane.

[01:35:42.610] - Speaker 1
Well, the Navy is sending a barge. They're going to pick it up. They're going to put it on the bars. And I was so exhausted at that point, so sleep-deprived, that I was like, We finished all whatever rehearsals and everything. And I'm like, I had to go sleep. So when I went to go to sleep, that was still the issue. And then I woke up to go finally do the thing. So this must have been maybe 10:00 or something. It was still an issue. And I'm trying to figure out who knows the head of the Navy. I was so free. What am I going to do? I don't know what to do if we don't have that location. It's all blocked out there. Well, then I wake up, I don't know, probably midnight or something. It'd go one o'clock. And then as we're walking toward getting ready to shoot the first thing, the first AD says to me, We got that worked out. They got the bomb.

[01:36:49.940] - Speaker 2
That's great.

[01:36:51.100] - Speaker 1
And by the way, at the time, I'm just like, okay, I never liked Hitler, but now it's personal. You know what I mean? Anyway, they finally they got it taken away and we got to use the bridge. There's still, I got to say, there's a million things I would have done different that I thought of after. I still, to this day, will think of this or That thing I should have done. But it was a noble experiment. And now, because I'm going to do another one, and I think I'll do it in Copenhagen, it'll be live and with Lord Nern. Great. Yeah.

[01:37:29.740] - Speaker 2
So It sounds like a really cool new format. It's just an exciting new way to make something.

[01:37:37.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's the perfect convergence of theater and film.

[01:37:40.680] - Speaker 2
When you leave the set at the end of the day, can you leave the character behind or does some of the character come with you during the whole time you're shooting?

[01:37:52.510] - Speaker 1
Depends. Sometimes, like with MBK, I think I got very immersed. And I remember going one time, I think it was in Chicago or somewhere, went to dinner after. And there's these people smoking cigars. I think this was in Paris, and I was promoting NBK. Yeah. Man, that took me a minute to shake. It sent me into a dark... I really did a lot shadow work. Anyway, I go to this restaurant, and they're smoking cigars after they eat. This is back when people still smoked in restaurants and such. But you know how cigars are another level of... Although you're about to become a cigar smoker. And so I went over to the two men that were sitting. I was at a long table, With Oliver Stone and certainly a number of models. Anyway, so I go over to the people and I'm like, Listen, we're still eating. Would you mind putting out your cigars? And I remember the guy going, How rude. And I'm like, Oh, you think that's rude? And I grab his cigar I just fucking put it out right in front of him, right? Well, you'd have thought I'd have shot his child or something.

[01:39:39.140] - Speaker 1
He was so freaked out. And he starts screaming. Anyway, I ended up just leaving the restaurant, and I didn't wait for the police. But I had a hard time shaking the affective. But generally, I don't have a hard time, and I shut it right off. If it's some negative character like that.

[01:40:04.150] - Speaker 2
Do you feel like you've been changed by any of the characters you've played?

[01:40:08.530] - Speaker 1
I think Playing Larry changed me because it was after Playing Larry that I did the thing on the Golden Gate Bridge where I protested. We climbed up the Golden Gate Bridge to protest the logging of the ancient redwoods in Northern California. And I don't think I would have done that shit. I got arrested for planting hemp seeds in Kentucky. All of that was influenced by playing Larry Flint.

[01:40:33.460] - Speaker 2
So you saw his courage?

[01:40:35.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And made me want to... Take action. Take action. Wow. And now I think I'm just a fucking I see you like an armchair activist.

[01:40:48.240] - Speaker 2
Speaking of which, tell me about your Saturday Night Live monolog.

[01:40:51.670] - Speaker 1
Oh, that. Well, I'm going to write my own thing I learned a long time ago. You better write your own thing. Otherwise, you get something on a Friday, you got to deliver on a Saturday you may not love. So I was working on it, but then I was like, I got to figure out weaving in this message.

[01:41:16.320] - Speaker 2
And did you do it in the rehearsal and you were able to get it through, or did it change it all for the live?

[01:41:22.730] - Speaker 1
I had the thing written before I came, but it was long. It was quite long. It's probably Probably the first reading of it at the first reading in New York was maybe twelve minutes.

[01:41:39.340] - Speaker 2
And how long is it supposed to be? Like five or six?

[01:41:41.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You don't want it to be more than five minutes. Well, I got it down. I kept cutting stuff out, and they did ask me, Jim, the right-hand guy to Lauren, Come on, man. How's it going How's it going to help you? How's it going to... Well, it's not going to help me, but it's like there's no other way to express it because if I had expressed it in some news thing, they'd just cut it out. You know what I mean? But to do it live, very hard to cut out. So I felt like it was the right opportunity. I wanted to express how I thought it was bullshit. I didn't quite do it right. I should have finished it a little different because the thing was it was the script I kept dragging it out, talking about this script. And then finally, I read the script and I'm like, it's about these drug dealers who just insist that everybody takes their drugs or they can't leave their house or whatever. And what I should have said at the end, I forget how I ended it, but I should have said, although it's a great business model, who's going to buy that?

[01:42:55.470] - Speaker 1
Maybe Hollywood. And even a year Year and a half ago, a movie I did called Fly Me to the Moon, which was with Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum. It's out now, by the way. It's a really great movie. Wonderful. Really well done. So I think it was the beginning of 2023. Still, every single person on that production was vaccinated. Literally, whatever, 150 people, 200 people, except one. And then they said, when I get my papers, they're like, And send us your vaccination card so we know you. Well, that's going to be hard because I wasn't vaccinated. And then they're like, they get pretty serious. They're like, okay, well, then send us the reason for your not being vaccinated. And I only put two words, personal choice. I still, to this day, wonder why didn't everybody have that out? Certainly, Scarlett or Channing could have got away with it, but not any other person on that production couldn't have. They all had to be vaccinated. Every driver, it made me so upset. I just felt it was wrong.

[01:44:23.600] - Speaker 2
What was the reaction in the room when you said it? Did people laugh?

[01:44:28.680] - Speaker 1
What was the- When I got to the end. Yeah. When I got to the end of that thing, I felt like people were... They didn't know quite... Hold on. What? It took a second. And then the rest of the show didn't suffer except for the fact that that's all they talked about after the fact. And then I got a barrage of mainstream media all saying the same thing, that it was this mumbling, incoherent model. Well, no. It was written out to the last detail. There's no mumbling. But they all say the same thing because that's how mainstream media is now. They all seem to have the same playbook.

[01:45:16.650] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Kiss the Ground.

[01:45:19.440] - Speaker 1
I love Kiss the Ground. I think the regenerative farming is absolutely imperative. This is Another thing, another pet peeve is these pesticides andFactory farms. Yeah, insecticides, all these things that they're using constantly. Well, they're affecting the bee population. I wonder if when there's no more bees, is honey going to be as valuable as gold? Anyway, so regenerative farming, I could go into the whole thing about that Liebig was the guy who started fertilizers. He did this thing where he took some plant matter and burned it. There was three elements to it that then they started to develop chemical fertilizers, right? And it started and then boom, it just spiraled until 10 years later, it was so omnipresent that he He realized that he was wrong, that the soil needed to be nourished by natural hummus, which is compost and stuff and like things that the living things should feed that soil, not these chemicals that ultimately was detrimental. But by the time 10 years later, he tried to say something about it. It was like he was drowned out by the forces that be. And I just thought it was interesting. His name was Liebig, lie big, big lie.

[01:47:00.550] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[01:47:01.510] - Speaker 1
Right? And that has affected our country and the world through Monsanto and everybody else. Now, these pesticides are so freaking huge, and it's affecting the bee population. It's affecting so many things. It's in our bodies. How did I get off on this tangent?

[01:47:26.570] - Speaker 2
No, but if you remember, in our lifetime, DD DDT was sprayed as a pesticide and considered healthy. You'd see commercials where people would be sprayed with DDT. And then Rachel Carson wrote the book, Silent Spring, and she was vilified for that.

[01:47:46.110] - Speaker 1
Right. Now there's no question about it. But yeah, I remember seeing children sitting at lunch, eating sandwiches, sprayed with DDT, saturated. Or children going behind one of those trucks with all the... They're on their bikes, and the DDT is just getting sprayed out of it. After DDT became illegal in the United States, I was in Costa Rica. They were still spraying DDT. Wow. So that company was still making it. I think that was a... Monsanto. Monsanto, I think, made DDT. They were still making it. I know. I get to be a whiny little bitch sometimes. These things drive me nuts. My daughters are like, why does this shit make you so crazy? I'm like, I don't know, but it's the injustice of it.
