[00:00:07.640] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. Tell me about the very first issue of whatever became vice.

[00:00:28.150] - Speaker 2
What was it first?

[00:00:29.470] - Speaker 1
Well, that's a long, complicated question to answer. It was a black culture magazine called Nuit d'Afrique in Montreal, and they figured they could get more money if they did an English language as well as a French language one. So that was called Voice of Montreal. A guy named Sérouge Alvie started it straight out of rehab.

[00:00:57.760] - Speaker 2
How do you meet Sérouge?

[00:00:58.990] - Speaker 1
Well, after I came back for my brother's wedding. I was living in Greece. I just came from now. My friend Gavin, at the time, had become comics editor. He's like, Oh, this guy Shane would be great. So I came down, met them, and that was just this weird mag that wasn't that great. Then we slowly took it over, did a lot of hip hop, and we became a street mag. I see. At some point, I was like, Well, why isn't anyone reading my genius? They're like, Well, we have to print more copies. I was like, Well, how do you print more copies? We have to sell ads. I'm like, What's an ad? I would hitchhike down to Toronto for Montreal. There's no money in Montreal. All the money is in Toronto. We would hitchhike and we take the city bus out to all the record labels, and we would pitch all the record labels, and we started getting more and more ads. Then they couldn't pay me my commission, so we're like, Okay, well, we own it. At that point, we were a voice. We dropped voice in Montreal. Then we were voice. Then we dropped the O and became vice, bought the company, and then started going crazy.

[00:02:19.830] - Speaker 2
Would you say it was a fanzine to start with? Is that how you describe it? How would you describe the original idea?

[00:02:25.600] - Speaker 1
I mean, Canadians are like Japanese in that we're on the periphery of the world, especially back then. So we were like culture scientists. We would know everything about music or fashion and stuff because we were far away from it. It was like hipsters before hipsters in the sense of people would study culture. They would study music. They would study fashion. That's like when we came down in New York and people were like, Who are these Canadians that are on point? How do they even know anything? Because Canadians are seen as being corny and whatever. I don't know. We weren't necessarily a fan, Dean, as much as we were like cultural scientists.

[00:03:12.400] - Speaker 2
And was it primarily focused on music at the beginning It was everything or no?

[00:03:16.260] - Speaker 1
It was everything. It was music. We started doing streetwear and skate fashion when that was new, hip hop, punk rock, and then weird stories, like stuff that we just found interesting, like freaky business.

[00:03:32.290] - Speaker 2
Were you more influenced by the American culture or UK?

[00:03:36.910] - Speaker 1
Both. Both. Yeah, Canadians are hyper aware of the British music scene and comedy, sense of humor, but also we live next to America, so a lot of the music. We get both UK punk and American hardcore. We We were, I would say, half and a half.

[00:04:03.040] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Sourish and tell me about Gavin.

[00:04:06.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:04:06.820] - Speaker 2
Those were your first two partners, essentially.

[00:04:09.520] - Speaker 1
Well, Sourish is like, You'd Love Me Then guru, really beautiful guy. Both his parents are professors, very smart, ran into some problems in college with drugs, and then I asked Ella for help and came out and started advice. It was just a super good vibe. Just a super... We're best friends to this day. We talk every day, like 30 years later.

[00:04:43.500] - Speaker 2
And you both grew up in?

[00:04:46.290] - Speaker 1
He grew up in Montreal. Gavin and I grew up in Ottawa.How.

[00:04:51.140] - Speaker 2
Far part of those?2 hours.

[00:04:54.190] - Speaker 1
Gavin and I knew each other since we were kids. Our dads knew each other. We were part of the Ottawa punk scene, and the Ottawa punk scene was like, you literally had to make your own band, rent your own venue, make your... Like, DIY to the billion.

[00:05:14.230] - Speaker 2
Who would have been the bands that you were most influenced by to become a punk band at that time?

[00:05:19.860] - Speaker 1
Minor Threat, Bad Brains, DC Hardcore. Misfits. Misfits were big in the French-Canadian, so we were half French, I think.

[00:05:32.150] - Speaker 2
First wave American Hardcore Punk.

[00:05:36.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You remember when punk was punk and there was hip hop, and then they did these weird punk hip hop mashups? Yeah. That was our era. Wu-tang was our era. When vice first started, I believe we were the first guys to ever bring them to Quebec.Wow.They came up, yeah. Everyone showed up, Chef Ray Kwan and Old Dirty Bastard. We got Old Dirty Bastard out of jail to come play a vice party. Amazing.

[00:06:03.770] - Speaker 2
In those days, what was distribution like? How many copies did you print and who did you go to?

[00:06:09.570] - Speaker 1
In the early days, we printed, I don't know, 35,000, which is a lot, and newsprint. It's tons and tons of pallets. Anyway, so we knew we had to... We started distributing to like, Mama Pop Records, some sorts of stuff. There was a company called Voyageur, which was a bus company, like Greyhound. We would, like Greyhound, and we would trade them ads, and we would come with these big pallets and put them on the busses. The busses would take them to Winnipeg or Vancouver, or Saskatchewan.

[00:06:40.530] - Speaker 2
But primarily Canada. Canada.

[00:06:44.460] - Speaker 1
Then It started getting bigger. Then the bus company was like, we were coming with pallets. Too many? They were like, We can't even fit them up. Then we started distributing in New York.

[00:06:58.010] - Speaker 2
At that time, were they free?

[00:06:58.680] - Speaker 1
It was always free. It's always been free. We started doing it in New York, and people thought we were just weird. Like, these weird frogs from Montreal doing this. New York just blew up for us.

[00:07:12.160] - Speaker 2
How many years into it did you move to New York?

[00:07:17.550] - Speaker 1
Four. Then so when we moved to New York, then it just exploded. There was a rich dude in Canada, Richard Sulinski, and he bought us and moved us to New York in the dot com bubble. We were like, we were skate. We never had any money. I left home very young. Punk, punk, punk. Then all of a sudden, we were walking around New York and prod a pump. It was like comedic. We were Canadian, Jocals just going, we're going to have asymmetrical zippers. We had money for the first time ever. That's when I bought my place in Costa Rica. I'd never had any money. Then I got my first taste of money. I'm like, I bought a farm in Costa Rica because I'm just like, I'm just going to spend all this money. Down in New York, losing our minds. And then they promptly went bankrupt. And so we bought the company back, I guess that was 1999, somewhere around there, 2000, 1999. And we moved to Brooklyn. We had so much money when we were with them, the other company, that we were going to buy all these companies. One of them was Triple Five Sole, and put them all together and do this e-commerce.

[00:08:38.660] - Speaker 1
So it was going to be basically Amazon before Amazon. It would have been huge, but it was 10 years too early. So we're going to buy Triple Five Sole, and then Troy was like, Oh, it's okay, kid. You can have part of my warehouse. He gave us a corner of his warehouse in Brooklyn. What was Brooklyn like at that time? It was, I mean, heaven, but It was like our warehouse had crack vials. Hookers were giving blow jobs on our staircase. We had to hose it down all the time. It was the Wild West. It was just that was a real early, early day at the beginning. When all the artists were out there, all the bands came like that, it was the same. We were in the right place at the right time because we became Planet Brooklyn. When all of these artists and musicians and that movement came out of Brooklyn, we were just there and chronicled playing it. All the Yaya Yazz and Interpol, The Strokes, and all those bands came out of there, TV on the radio, everybody. It was just like we were just in the right place at the right time.

[00:09:41.740] - Speaker 1
As Brooklyn blew up, so did we. That That was... Those were the glory days. From 9/11 to like 2010. That was just... It was good to be alive.

[00:09:55.110] - Speaker 2
Was it primarily New York magazine at that time, or were you trying to get it everywhere in the country.

[00:10:02.770] - Speaker 1
No, that was the fun part is, I believe the first city we went to, for some reason, was Tokyo. I don't know why. I think it was some sponsorship between the Canadian and Japanese Embassy or something. We launched in Tokyo, and I just fell in love with Japan. I was head over heels.

[00:10:22.770] - Speaker 2
We also have a culture of refined taste for American cultural stuff and all It was obsessive.

[00:10:30.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Obsessive. We just got along. I love Japan and fell in love with Japan. We were doing well in Japan, doing well in New York. Anything that does well in Japan and New York, it does well in in London, so we went to London. Then we came up with this business model where we would go find-You could get the magazine everywhere or only in those cities? Only in those cities. At this point, only in those cities. But then we would to England and we'd meet cool people and say, Okay, we'd do a deal. We had no money. We'd do a deal where we'd find a publisher in England, and we'd find our editor or whatever, and then we'd form a little company, and then they would do England, and they would distribute England the same way we distribute it.

[00:11:19.950] - Speaker 2
But you would send them content or they would create their own?

[00:11:22.860] - Speaker 1
It was the best of, so they would come up with some of their stuff. Each country we added, it got better because it would be like, this is from Berlin, and this is from London, and this is from Italy, and this is from Japan.

[00:11:37.780] - Speaker 2
Were everybody punk rockers in all these places, pretty much?

[00:11:40.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah, or music heads or fashion people, depending on as it grow bigger. Then that was, again, so 9/11 to 2010 was mostly Planet Brooklyn, punk rock, fucking booze and Coke and lunacy. Then, like nine 8, 9 to 15 was like, you move to Milan, get an apartment, you find an office, you hire the people, you live there. You go to Cinquiterra and meet the grandmother. You go, Here, you have a big party and everyone comes and bands and celebrities, and you can't get into your own party. Then you get on the train and go to Sweden to do it there. Like, What about the baby? You're like, I got to go. You would live everywhere for six months, and it was just so much fun to just travel around the world.

[00:12:31.880] - Speaker 2
Is that how most companies are built? No. I've not heard this story before, so it's interesting.

[00:12:36.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was all grassroots, and we just built it from the ground up. That's when it was making money, it was growing like wildfire, and we were getting the best content. It was misfits. We never had money to hire people who knew what they were doing. When Spike Jones said, Hey, you guys shoot everything in the magazine, right? We were like, Yeah. Then we went back to the office and we were like, How do we do that? We didn't just get a camera, I guess. We just started filming shit from the mag. That's when it really exploded because it was just as YouTube was starting, and the mag was at its peak. At this point, we were doing about a million copies a month, which is, for us, insane. It took us 10 years to get to a million copies. Then in our first year, we got to 100 million video views, and we were like, Oh, here we go. We started doing online video of our articles, and that's when it just went to the moon.

[00:13:40.410] - Speaker 2
Amazing story. Content-wise, similar content. It was just a change in format from the written word to video, would you say?

[00:13:49.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the content changed a lot over the years. Everyone thinks that they're like, no vice or we're guardians advice. All the editors were guardians advice, but there was no real. It changed and changed, and it kept changing from the... As we went more and more international, that changed it even more and more. I think that's why it was good is because it was always fresh. Also, we didn't take ourselves too seriously. When we went online, yeah, that was when it was... People used to make fun of us because of our story ideas. But we would write something like, There's a true story about a shipping container that went to Africa of two-pack Shakur T-shirt. Then they stole it or whatever. And then they became an army, the Tupac Shakur Army.

[00:14:38.790] - Speaker 2
How did you first hear the story?

[00:14:40.790] - Speaker 1
Who the fuck knows? I don't know. We get 100,000 of these a day just coming in like people. The story was general Butt Naked and the Tupac Shakur army. It was basically this guy who fought naked with his army because they believe they couldn't be killed, was fighting the Tupac Shakur army. We're like, Well, that's a story for vice. Then-so did you go personally? I was like, Well, let's just go shoot it. How bad could this be? We flew to Liberia to meet this guy, general Butt Naked.

[00:15:11.300] - Speaker 2
Had you been to Liberia before? No.

[00:15:12.730] - Speaker 1
Okay. No. Again, we've never been anywhere. We would go. I think we flew Air Belgium for $400. We had no money. We were staying at some grim place in Liberia. Anyway, and then you meet General Buttnaked, and he's talking to you about not only killing people, but eating them. He was a very famous cannibal. You're like, Holy fuck. Then there's all these other generals, and he's introducing these other generals and the stories that they're telling. And like, we went to Wynrovia, we went to West Point. West Point is the worst slum, maybe in the world, but definitely in West Africa. And it's fucking It's just gnarly. And everyone, by the way, it's so four. Were they happy to see you? No. Well, not happy. They want money. So they're like, How much of those shoes? How much of that? It's money and cameras and shoes. They just want any money. It's hyper... If you're anywhere for a long period of time, you just get surrounded by tons and tons of people. I remember I bought some... When you buy a drink, they buy a Coke or something. They pour it, little bits of it into a plastic bag.

[00:16:33.670] - Speaker 1
I bought some for some kids who were around. Then the bigger kids came out, and then the bigger kids came out, and it became like a little fish eating a bigger fish. You're like, I don't know. I just wanted to be like... It's rough, really rough.

[00:16:51.000] - Speaker 2
Did you ever feel in danger?

[00:16:52.860] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:54.230] - Speaker 2
How do you deal with that?

[00:16:56.520] - Speaker 1
There was two points. One time we got this That guy. So there's all these different generals, and one was General Mosquito, because mosquitoes are terrifying because of Dengue fever or malaria. The General Mosquito, then there's General Mosquito spray. Oh, that's it. So one was General Bin Laden. So we got General Bin Laden out of jail to go interview him. And then as we were interviewing him, the whole building got surrounded by 200 guys with all machine guns, his army.

[00:17:28.620] - Speaker 2
How would you get somebody out of jail?

[00:17:31.030] - Speaker 1
He just bribed the cops and said, Can we have him for a bit to interview him?

[00:17:36.610] - Speaker 2
You'd say in general, you could make things happen in most of the places you went? Yeah.

[00:17:44.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was scary. That was scary. Liberia is a scary place. But you get a bit of Stockholm syndrome because you're hanging out with butt naked, and he's saving you from a lot of these because he comes out and I was like, whoa. So you're like, I'm with him. I'm with butt naked. It's just a weird, weird, weird place.

[00:18:08.770] - Speaker 2
But did everybody spoke English?

[00:18:10.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because Liberia is actually formed by America. It's called-Explain. It was... You know Marcus Garvie? Mm-mm. Marcus Garvie led this back to Africa movement. It was freed slaves who went... Liberia means freedom, so liberty, Liberia. They bought a portion of West Africa. They went to West Africa. The capital city is called Monrovia, after Monroe, who is the President of America at the time. The Constitution was written in America. In Liberia, they have people with African names and people with American names, right? Like Charles Taylor, famously, who was the worst Civil War guys. So the Americans, the freed slaves, went to Africa and promptly enslaved the native Africans based on the plantation system that they had learned in America. So there was a slavery system where the American freed slaves enslaved the local Liberians. So then that started-Did you know this story before you went? Yeah, I knew the basics. And Charles Taylor is famous because he became like this. He killed so many people. He was back by us, and butt naked was against them.

[00:19:37.260] - Speaker 2
You called him butt naked or he called himself butt naked?

[00:19:39.770] - Speaker 1
He called himself butt naked. That was his general. He was General Butt Naked. They literally would fight naked, and they believe that that couldn't hurt them. He would tell crazy story. I was like, Yeah, before we would go to war, we would get a child and cut out their heart and eat their heart before going in because we believe it couldn't kill us, couldn't kill ourselves. Meanwhile, this is a guy who's openly telling you that walking on the streets, telling you these stories, and you're like, It's just... Coming from Brooklyn and flying into these places Other than meeting these people, you're like, What the fuck? But that's what vice became. So anyone said, What is vice? Is it content advice? It became like just fly into the place and press record. And also this whole thing of objectivity or subjectivity. They're like, Well, you're supposed to be objective. It's impossible to be objective. You're coming from Brooklyn to a place where they're talking about eating baby's hearts, and you're like, Yeah, I'm not really. Oh, so that whole voyage of going there and being The objective of like, this is how it's affecting me and stuff, became a signature vice style as well.

[00:20:52.530] - Speaker 1
And then from there, we started sneaking into like, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran. That's when it got gnarly.

[00:21:04.040] - Speaker 2
When did it turn to be more... The things you're describing are more, I would say more hard news versus culture. Yes?

[00:21:15.080] - Speaker 1
It was both. We got into news by doing culture because we did a feature called the Heavy Metal in Baghdad, which was about the only heavy metal band in Baghdad. Bagdad.

[00:21:31.020] - Speaker 2
So we were following-Was it illegal in Bagdad? No. It was okay.

[00:21:34.450] - Speaker 1
No, you couldn't be heavy metal.

[00:21:36.610] - Speaker 2
That's what I'm asking. Yeah.

[00:21:38.390] - Speaker 1
So it was the only heavy metal band in Bagdad. And we happened to be there shooting while George Bush Jr. Went and did the whole Mission Accomplish thing? So he's in the green zone saying, We're done. We won the war, and we're in the red zone getting shot at. And so all the people who were watching this said, Well, the war is not. What the fuck are you talking about? There was war still going on. And so we came at it through that point of view. To go back, news, the golden era of news, was basically somebody in New York calls a stringer in Afghanistan. Majority of stringers don't leave the hotel. They're rum-soaked. They call back in the story. They put it on the teleprompter, and Walter Cronkite reads it, and they're like, Everybody believes it. Everyone's like, Yep, that's the news tonight. God knows if it's real or not. It's also really colonial. It's like a bunch of white guys who've been to Harvard or whatever, going to the thing, writing it, having their take on it, whatever. Our take was just go there and press record and see what the fuck is actually going on.

[00:22:48.810] - Speaker 1
Nine times out of 10, it's not what they're telling you, and you see a completely different side of things. Especially if you embed with young people or locals or people who are like You remember maximum rock and roll? Yeah. Before the internet, maximum, and you'd go to different towns, and you'd meet someone for maximum rock and roll, and you knew that you were like-minded and like each other, whatever. Well, news or vice, whatever It was like an entree. That's why we got the vice rings made because it was a secret club. You'd go and you'd meet people like you, and they'd say, Look, I'll come fucking show you what's really going on. We noticed that a lot when we went to Afghanistan because everything that they were saying about Afghanistan Afghanistan was bullshit. We said it like five years before America left Afghanistan. We said, Yeah, America is going to leave Afghanistan, and the Taliban is going to have more territory than when we came in. We called it five years before because... It wasn't because we were geniuses. It was because everybody in the F. G. S. Thing would tell you that. That's when it became hard news, and that was the HBO era.

[00:23:52.880] - Speaker 1
That's when...

[00:23:54.260] - Speaker 2
How did the HBO deal even come to pass?

[00:23:57.530] - Speaker 1
We did our first vice Nice news deal with Google. Because in the beginning of YouTube, we were one of the largest video publishers, and then we became number one for video news. On YouTube? On YouTube. That's when our numbers were through the roof. Yeah. And everyone used to be... They still decry me for saying, Oh, we're going to be 10 times as high as CNN. We already were because they would have I don't know, like a 1.5. So like 1.5 million people. Even if you put in international, it would be like 15 million. It would be a massive, massive audience for seeing it. We were doing like 150 million video views per video. And you're like, okay, I mean, you're already were. Of course. That's when it was massive because when YouTube was roadblocking news for us, it was just fucking huge. Not making a lot of money, but I remember going to some nobody punk hit. I was in India somewhere shooting and people were going, Oh, it's Shane Smith. It's online. It was exploding. Then we did a little stunt at MTV, which wasn't great. Vice Guide to Everything. They wanted to be more Zips-zap, diddly-app, whatever.

[00:25:17.470] - Speaker 1
I remember going to the party where they said, I think we did two seasons, and we're not going to… I think we did two seasons. We're not going to renew Season 3. I said, Don't worry about it. We're going to HBO anyway. Because HBO is an MTV. We had no discussion with them. But Ari Emmanuel just went to Richard Plapler, and Richard Plapler is like, fucking, meant the greatest guy ever. He's just like, Let's make some news. They've never done it before. I'll never forget because we worked so hard on that first season. At the end of it, we figured out, because I've been in Korea a few times, we figured out that Kim Jong-Un loves basketball and that if we could get... They love the Chicago Bulls. We could get the Chicago Bulls to go over. We call it up Michael Jordan, Scottie Pipp, and they're like, Yeah, no. But the worm was out in Denver, I think, signing an autograph. Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman. Sorry, his nickname is the worm.

[00:26:29.470] - Speaker 2
It It was your idea.

[00:26:31.010] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Because I'd been there, I'd seen. They have the House of Treasures, which is two miles under a mountain in North Korea. You go and you see all the treasures. One of the biggest ones is this basketball signed by Michael Jordan and given by Madeleine Albright. Basketball is the biggest sport in North Korea. We sent Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetronners to play. Then Kim Jongunt invited our whole crew back to his house, and the whole world exploded. Every newspaper was like, Fuck, he said, Stunt journalists, and they did this bullshit. I remember-Tell me about the experience. Well, we had just done this series, which, by the way, ended up tying Bourdaine for the Emmy. Wow. Our first Bourdaine to use, one of the Emmy with Borean. Prime time, maybe, like real. We were really proud of that first series. Then we just got shot on about this North Korean thing. I'm like, The BBC shot on us a lot, and we're like, Hold on, you tried to sneak in in a student group. You're endangering the lives of a student. We figured out a way to get in and get access in a view that nobody else has gotten, and we just were getting shit on.

[00:27:47.920] - Speaker 1
I remember being torn apart. I remember lying in the bath and reading these reviews and going, Wow, we tried. And we launched to a five, which is, I think it was only to Game of Thrones. It was a huge number, especially for a news show. And Plepler was like, That's what these all press is, good for it. Don't worry about these hatsoles.

[00:28:13.700] - Speaker 2
Hbo was supportive of the fact that you got good numbers?

[00:28:17.400] - Speaker 1
Super supportive. No, they were supportive of the show. We got good numbers because of all the press. I didn't realize that because I was like, When we took it seriously.

[00:28:25.770] - Speaker 2
So the bad press actually fued.

[00:28:27.740] - Speaker 1
The reason why we were successful because of all that bad press. It was like a $10, $20 million campaign for the show. When that show launched, that's when everything changed because we started winning Emmys. To win an Emmy, Emmys are a racket. It's like, if you win, you get a vote. 60 Minutes have to be getting Emmys for 70 years. Abc News, CBS News. That's almost impossible to be a new kid on the block and win an Emmys. We started winning Emmys off the... We won Emmys, we won Peabody's and Polk's and Pulitzer and stuff. You had to be really good.

[00:29:05.850] - Speaker 2
But you were also doing real journalism. You were breaking stories that nobody else broke. And stories that people were actually interested in because they would watch them.

[00:29:14.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was the glory Days because we would come up with a story, go shoot it, have a ton of fun, come back, cut it with your crazy bad news bears, and it would go up, and then you'd be at the awards. It was like whatever. You would think it up I remember saying to everybody, Enjoy these times because this is how documentary filmmaking works. You go pitch something for three years, and you make it for three years, and it comes out, and nobody watches it. That was just glory Days. I think we were seven years on HBO. That was just like-Why did it change?

[00:29:47.880] - Speaker 2
Or what changed?

[00:29:49.510] - Speaker 1
Three things. Piper, laughter was ousted, and he was the visionary. We also, because the show was doing so well, It went from 8 was the first buy, and that year we did actually 12. They bought four more. Then it went to 22.

[00:30:09.500] - Speaker 2
More episodes.

[00:30:10.490] - Speaker 1
Yeah, then it went to 56. Then we went to a weekly show, and it was just too much.

[00:30:15.060] - Speaker 2
Just hard to keep up that level of good content for that much.

[00:30:18.360] - Speaker 1
Lots and lots and lots. Somebody was looking at it at one point, because we were doing so much, they were like, We're spending more on place than we are on Game of Thrones. Now, Game of Thrones was doing 12 episodes, and we were doing a fucking hundred. But it was a lot of money. Most shows don't last over five years because that's when it gets more expensive and whatever. Then Plapler left, and we were having a hard time keeping up with Because if you're doing 12 to 20 episodes, you can just really concentrate on knocking them out of the park. But we went to Showtime after and we kept winning Emmys, and it was good, but it never had the same cachet as those HBO. That was at the pinnacle of HBO's. That was Game of Thrones. Anyway, all like girls and I don't know. There was four big hits on the head that they had all the time. Then there was that. They were killing it. And then after that, now HBO is in the max, and you're like, I don't even know what max is. Why would you change HBO to max? Anyway, so HBO changed, the media industry changed, we changed, and there you go.

[00:31:31.540] - Speaker 2
What were the other things going on at the same time? So it sounds like from a focus perspective, the HBO series would have been the most watched thing you were doing, yes?

[00:31:47.660] - Speaker 1
Not by numbers because online, our own own became... We were doing, at our peak, like billion three, billion four video views a month. That would be much bigger than HBO. Hbo was status. It was like... I see.

[00:32:04.310] - Speaker 2
You had success in the old media model as well as the new media model. There you go. I understand.

[00:32:09.200] - Speaker 1
You should be in media. We were killing it on TV, but online was 10X that. That's where we were making our bread and butter. Then we expanded into... We bought a TV network, and we started into agencies and bought studio.

[00:32:27.190] - Speaker 2
Tell me about... Let's talk about each one of those. The idea of doing the TV network?

[00:32:31.620] - Speaker 1
Well, look, I'm a hustler. I called it years and years ago. I mean, I made a McTaggard speech. I've said it to anyone who listened the whole time. I don't know what it was when we started, but it was like 55 cents of every dollar went to the Big Four. Now it went 60 cents and 70 cents. Now it's like 82 cents of every dollar goes to the Big Five. That's 15 cents left for everybody else in the world. So independent publishing was heading for a wall, and everybody knew it. It's funny because five years ago, everyone used to say, Google and Facebook, YouTube, Amazon. These guys are taking all It was all the money. And everyone was like, Yeah. It just got worse and worse and worse. And then everybody just went, oh, well, what are you going to do? And so we knew that that was going to happen. We saw it happen. By the way, I think everybody saw it was going to happen. We're like, okay, let's use insane valuations to buy things that are going to be... It's like a hedge fund model. You say, Okay, well, we'll take our valuation.

[00:33:39.050] - Speaker 1
We'll buy a distressed media asset, which is a TV channel. Ironically, we have the TV channel today, and it's throwing off money because it's a TV channel. They just throw off cash. We did it as a plan to offset and to... We built five different legs of the... We had an agency.Diversified.Exactly..

[00:34:00.010] - Speaker 2
Because of the limitations on the growth in digital publishing. Because it was becoming more and more the mainstream was taking more and more of that space. Yes.

[00:34:11.630] - Speaker 1
Well, not the mainstream because they're in the same, not mainstream media like the old-school guys who now are in the same boat, ironically, that we were in. Anything that's advertising-based is screwed because all of a sudden, Google came along with YouTube and just and Facebook. Facebook runs a lot of online video. What they don't run, Google does, YouTube. Between those two, Facebook, BuzzFeed did a lot of work with Facebook, and they were just going through the roof. Then one day, Facebook just changed their algorithm. They just buzz feed half. To say we were reliant on them is to understate it.

[00:34:56.130] - Speaker 2
Did you ever have that experience with YouTube? It changed the algorithm?

[00:34:59.210] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was more of a Facebook thing. But when we were partners with YouTube, it was definitely easier to get the traffic. There was a long period of time when you were doing SEO optimization and you were buying traffic and everyone was about the traffic, traffic, oh and oh traffic, oh and oh traffic. Then all of a sudden, when TikTok came up or Instagram, then it just became about all screens all the time because your own O couldn't compete with TikTok. Then it just became being everywhere, which is great for numbers, but terrible for money.

[00:35:40.520] - Speaker 2
Looking at the media landscape today, how different is it than when you were able to do what you were able to do?

[00:35:48.130] - Speaker 1
A hundred % different. We started when desktop publishing was just sophisticated enough where three idiots could make a 16-page print mag. It was literally just coming. Now everything's on phones, everything's on these massive platforms. The consumption is through the roof. I mean, if you see, by the way, I called this as well in my McTiger's speech. I'm like, look, there's going to be massive consolidation, which has to happen not only between the online companies, but between the mainstream companies, because you have these Big, massive companies with ever-shrinking audiences. But you have one audience that's growing and just consuming stuff. What are they consuming? Well, going forward, I'll tell you what they're going to be consuming. They're going to be consuming AI because you can just print anything. It gets made. Then you print this. It's going to be personal AI channels, which has your stories, your hosts, your this, your that. It's going to be everything becomes everything for everybody. No one could have ever predicted that that's what the future of media is going to be, because all of these big productions, all of the studios, making, going out in the field and digital video teams and people who have cameras, that's three years away from being obsolete.

[00:37:25.070] - Speaker 1
I could have never predicted. Now it seems crazy, But we used to get in shit for going from a magazine to online video. People were like, Oh, it was like Dylan going electric. You sell out. Fuck you. We were so angry. Gen X is so angry that we became millennial because we went to online video. Now we're going to a super studio format, which is what everyone's doing. Studio is the only way you make any money. Obviously, we get shit on and wait until the fuck are you.

[00:37:54.410] - Speaker 2
Is there any point in the vice story where you feel like vice sold out?

[00:37:59.820] - Speaker 1
I wouldn't necessarily say sold out because we were always independent. We always sold pieces of it.

[00:38:05.890] - Speaker 2
I would say that- But from a content perspective, do you ever feel like you made... Did you ever pander in your content away from what you actually liked?

[00:38:15.390] - Speaker 1
The problem with content, and what people don't understand, it's the same thing with TV, people don't put content on that they like because they like it. They put content on rates. Vice, to go back, around 2017, at the peak of the HBO era, because all of our big clients, Google and the studios and everybody was out in LA. I moved to LA. I stepped back from day to day, but kept doing news. Vice The other channels, not the news, started moving because we always say, give the company over to the interns, like every five years. And vice started moving into this weird, woke era or whatever. But it was the young people writing for themselves to the audience. It was like our audience went from millennials to whatever that is, Gen Z, and they were writing for themselves to themselves. And by the way, traffic was through the But the old vice audience, including me, were like, What are we doing here? And also one of the mistakes was vice news was over here, which I was concentrating, and it was still killing it and doing awards and stuff. But people didn't differentiate between vice.

[00:39:45.760] - Speaker 1
Com and vice news. There was this vice. I think that was a fuck up. We should have had a lot more differentiation. And I mean, the go woke, go broke thing I'm well aware of. And a lot of times I'd see stuff and you'd be like, what the fuck? And then you go to give someone shit. They're like, okay, the one you liked, 10 people saw. The one that this shit was 100 million. That's just what fucking young people want, you're an old man. You're like, oh, well, it's a problem with digital media, and then it changes with the audience. The audience now, the That young audience, that young digital consuming audience, is that audience, and that's the content they want. It became problematic. Definitely, to be speaking of selling out, Disney or any of those corporate partners. They didn't want that. We didn't want that. It was just this... We had, I don't know, 5,000 employees doing 7,000 pieces a day, and just all of this stuff would come out and just be like, What the fuck is this shit? What the fuck? So did we lose control of the bicycle? Yeah.

[00:41:07.410] - Speaker 2
If you were to go back to the original model of the HBO show, and if you would decide to do 8-12 episodes a season now and found the right distributor, whether it be the Netflix or Hulu or whoever it would be, do you think that it would have It's the same impact that it originally had?

[00:41:32.000] - Speaker 1
I don't think so. I think you have to be in the right place at the right time. I also think, for example, Netflix, the big guys who could do it now, Google, Netflix, Apple, Amazon.

[00:41:45.620] - Speaker 2
How could Google do it now?

[00:41:47.150] - Speaker 1
Well, hold on. They won't do it now.

[00:41:48.980] - Speaker 2
But how could they?

[00:41:50.030] - Speaker 1
Well, because they have a large audience in the world. So they can do anything.

[00:41:54.150] - Speaker 2
But if we're talking about a TV show.

[00:41:58.400] - Speaker 1
Now, there's no such thing. No Yeah, it's the same thing. Apple has TV shows. They never get shown on TV. They get shown on Apple TV. But the big one is now. If you really want to do well, it's Amazon or Netflix, let's say. No is the answer, and I'll tell you why. Because Netflix in particular, if you do a news show, then you do a story on Modi, and then Modi gets pissed off and then kicks Netflix out of India. They've just lost $22 billion business because you said, I don't like Modi. So, excuse me, they're not going to do that.

[00:42:37.360] - Speaker 2
It's too dangerous for a big corporation to back this content. Super dangerous.

[00:42:42.790] - Speaker 1
And news on TV doesn't work and hasn't worked in a while. It's aging up, and it's just now there's fear mongering. So Fox is just fear mongering, and MSNBC and all that is just comedy making fun of the fear mongering. We believe that there's a huge middle, like the silent majority, of centrist The main people who are not being catered to. We're going to try to make news products for them. You hit the nail on the head, which is, can it be like it was in the HBO glory Days, the answer is no, because there's no HBO, and it was the beginning of all that shit. But there's an opportunity now. For example, what you're doing, podcasting is this new frontier, and it's exploding. We said, if we wanted to do something around this election cycle, because it's going to be we're already seeing it's completely sheer bull, goose, lunacy, and it's only going to get worse. We were like, let's take the biggest social media memes. It's like millions of people going, let's take them and let's deconstruct them. Let's talk to people on either side. Let's do it like a scientist. Let's do it like a journalist.

[00:44:15.080] - Speaker 1
I'm an analyst. I'm an investigator. Let's go investigate. One of the things I love doing was we went to Antarctica. No, sorry. We went to Greenland, and Greenland is melting. Greenland is something like two meters or three meters There's a sea level rise. It's melting as fast as it can. We're like, Hey, guys, Greenland melts. We're all screwed. This is at the peak of HPL. We got innundated. Usually, we get something like 10 million comments. We got like 28 million comments, and usually it was like 60% positive. It was like 90% negative. There was just bots and everyone's fucking going crazy, me especially. I'm like, Okay, let's follow the story. We went, we found the traffic. It was all conservative think tanks, and they're like, there's more ice ever. In Antarctica, shifting the poles, more sea ice. Antarctica, Antarctica, Antarctica. We went to a conservative conference and the think tanks. We interviewed everybody. Then there We're like, It's Antarctica, you idiots. So we went to Antarctica, met with all the scientists. Like, yeah, it's melting as fast as it can melt. We're like, Well, what? And they're like, Yeah, well, there's always flat Earthers. We're like, Flat earthers is 45% of the fucking America The population.

[00:45:31.360] - Speaker 1
They're like, Well, we're not salesmen. We're scientists. What do you want us to do? I'm like, They're not. They're saying you work in that, are you? They're saying that there's never been more. And they're like, Yeah, well, they're in. They're wrong. To go back to my long-winded story is we want to do that with political memes. For example, the $24 Big Mac took on everything. Biden said it's $24. It's everywhere. And we looked, I have these traffic guys needs to work for me at Vice News, and they're like, Yeah, it's all coming from China. Ccp, Chinese Communist Party. Because somebody had posted somewhere $24, and it had gotten some traction. So they just turned on the... There's no $24 Big Mac. In fact, McDonald's came out and said, Yeah, it's $4.95 where there's a fuck Big Mac is. There's no $24 Big Mac. Then it was like, bing. All of these conspiracy theories, all of these people on the right, on the left, and And I'm just like, let's call them. Let's just talk to them. Let's call the people who are fucking on either side of it. They get their point of view and then also see where the traffic is coming from, because a lot of time it's coming from Russia.

[00:46:43.420] - Speaker 1
Russia will tell you, open. Yeah, we're trying to fuck your election. We're trying to fuck your electoral post. As is China, as is the Free Syrian Army, as are the Iranians. So many people are trying to fuck with our shit. And so you just have these young people going ding, ding, ding, ding. And the reason why I got back in the game is so many of the people I was working with would just say something that's preposterous as if it's a given. We're not even discussing that. That's just part of the thing we got to, the given. You're like, That's not a given, dude. That's bullshit. Where are you even getting that? And I think that what's happened because of the first Trump election was he did an amazing job of, they would say, fake news. And he'd say, No, you're a fake news. He literally I just did a kindergarten like, you're fake news. And it went, oh, that's fake news. And now everything's fake news. Nobody believes anything anymore. This is a huge problem because there's no basis of truth because everyone's just like, that's bullshit. Well, and like, if you, Chez La Femme, if you look for the source, the sources are all these fucking nefarious, weird.

[00:47:54.560] - Speaker 1
And everybody is, by the way, just throwing so much fuel on fire. So we're like, let's try to find these 10, 20, 30 massive, massive issues that no one agrees upon, try to talk to people on both sides, try to talk to experts, and figure out where the traffic is coming from. And wouldn't that be an exciting show? We think that'll be a little bit more interesting than just the shotgun approach of the HBO show, which was just like, let's figure out what's interesting in the world today.

[00:48:26.750] - Speaker 2
I'd be really curious to see that. I'd like to see that. There you go. Great.

[00:48:30.160] - Speaker 1
Well, this is the first one. We're doing it together.

[00:48:32.690] - Speaker 2
Was vice ever banned or censored?

[00:48:36.150] - Speaker 1
Yeah. We used to say, we take the sex pistols brand of marketing, i. E. Get banned and go number one. In Canada, America, you have no freedom of speech. In Canada, they just censor the shit out of everything. We had vice. It wasn't even an article. It was a skate ad, and the skate ad got banned at my alma mater. So Gavin and I went to Carleton for Gordie McGill and he went to Gordie, but we were at Carleton, so we used to distribute in Carleton. They banned us from Carleton. And then the Carleton newspaper ran the article and used the same image. And using the same methodology, they banned their own newspaper. Then the gay and lesbian newspaper wrote about it, used the same image, and they got banned. That's censorship. Then, of course, all Canadian media called us to say, What happened? We're like, Well, that's censorship. Because obviously, you should censor us because we're filled with terrible, horrible, garbage. But then the next guy gets banned, and the next guy gets banned, and the next guy gets... That's what censorship is. Everybody wants to censor something. I love any censorship argument because I've been on in my whole life.

[00:50:00.780] - Speaker 1
But yeah, we get banned all the time. You get banned and your kids love it. You're off to the races. So we've been banned, I don't know how many times, tons and tons of times. Europe, we come here, we get banned. Italy, actually, You have to register with the local council, and local council has one clergyman. So can you imagine vice giving every month to a fucking clergyman to say, Okay, let's see what we got here. And it's like, Which dildo is best for a donkey? It would be like-Was that ever a real vice story? I don't know. It sounds like a vice story. There's a funny meme where the guy gets a dildo and he goes, Country funk, and it hits Tunisia. Fucking animal. It's like, donkey, sexual vibrator. It's an actual vice thing. It's like, Tunisian donkeys are being fallaciated by vibrators or whatever. You're like, Okay, I can take a good joke. You're like, vice articles became and headlines became a bit fucking rich at the end. There used to be a thing called not vice or something that was just... It was like online and you had to pick which was a fake vice headline and what was a real vice headline.

[00:51:17.220] - Speaker 1
It did become a bit rich. But anyway, yeah, we got banned all the time.

[00:51:22.580] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story with John McAfee.

[00:51:25.530] - Speaker 1
That was a weird one. He was on the run in Belize, I don't know who he was on the run from because we couldn't figure out if he had made it all up or if it was real. I think it was 90% made up in his head, but maybe a little bit real. We sent a reporter down there to go follow him. And then-He contacted you?

[00:51:51.990] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Was that normally the case?

[00:51:55.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah, a lot of times. We contact people. Everybody knows everybody. So like, My uncle knows this guy, or they caused... At our peak, everyone was like, I got a story for you guys. So we sent somebody down, and then they were following them. They decided to go on the run with them or whatever. And then I guess they took a picture of him, but it had the metadata still linked to it so that they could find him. But I don't know if anyone was actually looking for him. But we got in shit the metadata picture.

[00:52:32.570] - Speaker 2
From him?

[00:52:34.040] - Speaker 1
No, he didn't. He was with us. I don't know that they ever caught him. I don't know that he was ever...

[00:52:40.820] - Speaker 2
But if they weren't after him, why would the metadata been a problem?

[00:52:44.200] - Speaker 1
The whole thing about it was like, the internet blew up for a day about it and you're like, we were involved in it. It's still unclear as to whether or not he was actually being saved. But he was a freaky guy. The person who went down there was just whoever was in the office, I guess, went down there and took a picture because he said, take a picture, and they didn't take off the metadata. Anyway, I forget how it ended, but I think he got caught. They went through and then let him go. It turned out to be much a do about nothing.

[00:53:21.780] - Speaker 2
What were some of the other places that you flew into and got to experience something unusual, let's say?

[00:53:31.620] - Speaker 1
So many. The one I remember was there's another great story, which was this guy named General Abdul Rizk, and he was like a teenager. He was a kid, maybe before he was a teenager. In in Kandahar, and the Taliban are from Kandahar. When the Taliban came, he got kicked out. His parents were killed. So he's like this young kid went through the tunnels into Pakistan. He's sweeping the floors in a shitty shop in Pakistan, illiterate, fucked up. And then becomes a teenager, goes back through the tunnels and gets this teenage gang together, and they just start killing Taliban. But they look like fucking Adam and the ants. They have these weird shreds of things, colored rope, not ropes, like colored ribbons. They wear a crazy color. They look awesome. He was known as a Taliban killer. He's a teenager, and he When the Americans invaded, they said, Bring us anybody who's fighting the Taliban. So they bring him to Kabul. They train him. They give him this ludicrous amount of money. And he becomes the Police Chief of Kandahar, and then eventually governor of Kandahar. It's like Kurtz, like when he went into this region and all enemy activity died.

[00:54:56.640] - Speaker 1
So he goes to Kandahar. Where the Taliban are from. The NeroTalaman. I get it. Kills it. It kills. It fucking kills the shit. You can imagine he's not a good guy. Lots of killings, lots of torture. He's a bad guy. But he becomes, I think, maybe the biggest drug dealer in the world, running the opium into Pakistan. He has all this gold bullion. His brother kills Karzai, the Prime Minister's brother. Super powerful guy. I flew in the Kandahar. In these places, you It can't be. You have to wear like...

[00:55:32.980] - Speaker 2
You have to dress as if you're from the place. Yeah.

[00:55:35.960] - Speaker 1
And so I'm pink. It's funny because I went into Northwest Frontier province with Saroosh, who's a bag of standing. So he speaks to her, doing everything. I had just come Both were shooting in Kashmir, which is another hotspot where they're having a war. I was wearing Kashmiri Chuppal. So a pink guy, I had a long beard and handed the beard because that's what they do there. So I handed the beard and I was wearing Kashmiri Chuppal. I remember they asked the Ruche, Does your religious leader require any dietary restrictions? Because there's only one guy who's got a pink face wearing a Kashmiri Chuppal, and he's a badass. Because a lot of the top fighters and the top come from Daghistan, which is in Russia, because Daghistan is where the Spetsnats run. Basically, it's like super training ground. If you go into the forest, it's called, if you're Muslim, you fight the Spetsnafs, the Russian Special Forces. So you become super badass. Those guys then go out and train everybody else, like the Taliban and Boko Haram and everything. So they thought you're one of those guys. So anyways, we go interview him. And I don't speak Pashto, so I'm sitting there talking to him in English, and then there's translating the new...

[00:56:51.500] - Speaker 1
Anyway, I finish the interview, fly to Kabul, which is grim, but this is how bad Kandahar is. When I flew into Kabul, I'm like, It's Paris in the springtime. You're like, There's hotels and there's food. Oh, my God. He was knock, knock, knock on my door, and they bring me to the American embassy. It's Treasury, DEA, and CIA. They're like, Okay, we'll trade for you. We'll give you deep cover, meaning deep cover stories. We're not going to attribute them, whatever, but we'll give you the actual story. That's true. If you give us Riddgick, give us the stories on Riddgick, I'm He's your guy. You fund him. He's your guy. And he's like, Yeah, he's off the reservation. And I'm like, I just spoke to him in English, and he spoke back to you and passed you. I don't have any insight into that general, Abdu Al-Rizk. I don't know what you're talking about. But if he's that far off the reservation, then this is a worry, because he's literally the Taliban killer. And the minute that guy goes, which happened, then Kandahar goes. So that was freaky because you're sitting there going like, I'm this punk kid.

[00:58:02.930] - Speaker 1
I used to fucking bus for fucking quarters. All of a sudden, you're talking to the CIA and DEA about fucking trading for deep cover stories about fucking The Taliban.

[00:58:15.900] - Speaker 2
You show up in these places with a story in mind. Are you ever surprised by what's actually happening there? Always. Are the people who are the bad guys necessarily the bad guys? Tell me about this. Tell me about our your understanding of the world versus your first-hand experience of the world.

[00:58:34.170] - Speaker 1
Well, there's always a point of view. For example, the Taliban are such a bad guy, Taliban. If they're American, they're freedom fighters because we invaded their country, and they said, We're going to fight you until you leave. If you want to look at it objectively, they're very successful freedom fighter. They beat America. By the way, before that, they beat Russia. Before that, they beat England. They're fucking the empire killer, right? Why? Because they don't want their country to be invaded.

[00:59:06.400] - Speaker 2
And why is everybody invading their country?

[00:59:09.770] - Speaker 1
Well, geopolitically, it's very important because it's in between India, China, and Iraq, and Iran. It's the crossroads.

[00:59:22.980] - Speaker 2
More location than anything else.

[00:59:25.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's also very difficult to tame. And so if it's very difficult to tame, then shit can go down, like trading camps for extremists, et cetera. I mean, that's the whole thing is like, oh, 9/11 happens, and they say, okay, we're going to go there, which at least had a modicum of sense because they had training camps there. They're also like, we're also going to invade Iraq, which had zero, like absolutely nothing to do with it. We're just going to do that, too. We're just going to go in there. It's ludicrous. But if you go to Afghanistan. I mean, are they good guys? You can believe in them or not believe in them, but they are fighting for the freedom of their country, and everyone forgets that, and we dehumanize them, and we tell these terrible stories about them, and everybody jumps on board. That's what I'd say is surprising, is that everybody, all media, will just jump on board with the political narrative, and just nobody deviates from it. I got to give it to Al Jazeera. We do have colonialist news, which is our point and our point of view is right. If you go to the countries, they're like, Yeah.

[01:00:36.170] - Speaker 1
If you go to Iraq, we went in there and mismanaged it so badly. We created, not Al Qaeda, we created ISIS. America made Isis because we created this vacuum. Then Isis came along and you're like, Well, that's not good. What we did in Afghanistan and what we did in Iraq were bad things. And how we get it back here, the propaganda is propaganda. That's one thing. Wars have propaganda on both sides, and one side always believes that my Side isn't propaganda.

[01:01:18.120] - Speaker 2
Have you spent any time in Russia? Yeah.

[01:01:19.830] - Speaker 1
What's that like? A lot of time. They've had an interesting time where they were the shit. They were number two, and then Yeltsin gets blamed for a lot of stuff. Basically, Putin is trying to get them back to where they were before their... The way they see it is we had a complete economic collapse, and everybody feasted on our corpse. I remember saying, when I was in Russia, Putin, is he Communist? Is he fascist? What is he? They're like, No, you don't understand, Shane. He's for Russia. And you're like, Okay, got it. But on the political spectrum, because he He was part of the KGB, but now... No, no, Shane, he's a patriot. He's for Russia. So he wants to get Russia back to those old borders and those old territories and all that stuff. A, B, I talked to Lavrov, who's the foreign minister, and he'll say that, and they've been saying it to anyone who'll listen. If you put missiles on our border, for example, in the Ukraine, it's exactly the same as putting missiles in Cuba or Canada or Mexico. We're not going to let you do it. We're going to retaliate.

[01:02:33.040] - Speaker 1
They've said that for the last 20 years, and then you would go do it, and you're like, what do you think is going to happen?Unprovoked. Yeah, unprovoked. Oh, my God, what happened there? And so when you go, there's two sides to every story, and poor Ukraine is Vietnam. It's a proxy war that's being fought in its backyard, and that's unpleasant for everybody who's there. But there's two sides to every story. That's the one thing that's really messed up in America now is we don't have two sides to one story. We have one side that's hyper impassioned and angry and won't even listen or talk to the other people. And you're like, you have two parties in America. But that's the other thing. When I first came down to America, so I studied politics and economics. When I first came down to America, You know, Baba Clinton had done, he had shrunk government and had the largest surplus of all time. And then Bush increased this level of government and had the biggest deficit of all time. So basically, the Republicans and the Democrats switched their whole basis of their whole political mandate. No one in America said, boo.

[01:03:49.630] - Speaker 1
No one said, Shit. And that's when I realized a lot of this stuff, and now it's with Trump and Biden, which makes for fucking insane political theater. But a lot of this stuff in America, because America is not a democracy, it's a Republic. If you talk to the founding fathers, they're like, yes, it's made to do nothing and to do it very slowly. But a lot of this stuff is bread and puppet theater. It's to give the mass imagination that this is a massive democratic process, that there is agency, that you actually have some democratic country And you're like, well, it's not set up to be a democracy. It's a Republic. And you have two parties. That means one is in power and the other one's in opposition. So they're always in power. And so a lot of this stuff is bread and pop at the dinner. But now it's amplified to the point of just impassioned lunacy. And the thing that we have to watch out for is, I was in Yugoslavia during the war there. And what happened was Tito kept everybody under his thumb, but he was afraid of the Soviet Union.

[01:04:59.380] - Speaker 1
So he put a machine gun in everybody's house. So when he died, everyone just starts shooting each other because they all had machine guns. No problem if you don't have a machine gun. And now America has just been arming itself for the last decade, like superarming itself. And no one is listening to each other's point of view. Democrats, it's like the old Soviet Union, America, like, oh, Russians eat babies. Oh, American guys. The Democratic and Republican propaganda agenda against each other is dehumanizing and doing this war. And that's terrifying because you're like, it's a fucking Republican Party versus Democratic Party. It used to be, and it should be, nothing. Like, whoever you vote for is whoever you vote for. And then you're done. Then you get on with life, and who cares? But it's like a declaration of fucking war. It's crazy, man. So good for media, and good for news, and good for what I'm doing, but terrible for anybody else.

[01:05:58.930] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the home you grew up in.

[01:06:02.850] - Speaker 1
That's a weird question.

[01:06:05.630] - Speaker 2
Really? It seems so straightforward.

[01:06:07.070] - Speaker 1
Really? It's funny. I've been thinking about it because I just came from Greece. I think Greece was the first I was young and beautiful for the first time, and punk wasn't part of my persona, and it was gorgeous, and it was weird, and water. Pre-punk.

[01:06:26.360] - Speaker 2
This is pre-punk.

[01:06:27.720] - Speaker 1
No, sorry. This is post-when I was fun. I'm getting to that. But it was like I first discovered beauty in that 18, 19, 20. Before that, Ottawa, no money, punk, everything was very grim. We celebrated the work in class. I worked as a bartender from a very young age, so I had money, so I left home at a young age. There was a lot... You know Punk Rock Palace? It was like you could be in a band and then you would pay the out of the band money and stuff. So I grew up playing in punk bands. You lived in a commune with other band guys? Yeah, exactly. I had a fine family life. My dad was very strict and was like, You have to learn how to build a house and build a car, and you have to get straight A's, and you had to box, and you had to do this stuff. Because his dad was self-taught and ended up being a big war hero, even though he left school in grade 8 or something. And so he was a real harsh taskmaster. So my dad was like, Look, life is tough. Life is hard.

[01:07:36.140] - Speaker 1
Life is like a shit sandwich. The more bread you have, the less you have to eat. But he was the only guy to ever lose money on the insider trading. So he never really did well. But he was like, he's an academic smart guy, but just whatever. Life never worked for him. So basically, I left home very young, punk, using my Duke's hustler. Then I moved to Greece, and I was like, This is on the menu?

[01:07:59.690] - Speaker 2
How How did it work out for you to move to Greece?

[01:08:01.800] - Speaker 1
I was in a band, and we were just tooling around, busking. Then I went to there, we were busking. We were in Athens, and the guy said, You want to come out? He gave us a house on the beach. We could eat in any restaurant, drink in any bar. We had to play one night at the Hard Rock Cafe, one hour a night. I never left. I'm like, This is the greatest fucking thing. But it was the first time I was coming out of this real working class, punk, northern, cold, trench-coaty world, all of a sudden, wearing like, flip flops and shorts and just being tanned and beautiful and be like, Oh, my God, this is great. I was saying, I used to say, This is the truth. One more year, then I'm going back to Greece, man. One more year, then I'm going back to Greece. It's my ontological paradise. But yeah, I don't know. My dad was a harsh taskmaster. My mom was overprotective, so Irish.

[01:08:52.980] - Speaker 2
Do you have brothers and sisters?

[01:08:54.670] - Speaker 1
Brother. And then so they got older. They got divorced. And then we were I was so out of control, these young punk kids, that my mom got remarried to put some rational... We were going crazy. And because of that, I left. I was like, Well, fuck you. Then left home. I had a good relationship. I still have a great relationship with him. But it was just like, oh, now a man, 14 or 15. I'm like, okay, fuck it. I'm out. Then it was just there, but for the Grace of God, go I. When you're 15, 16, 17, you're not making the best of decisions. But I was obsessed with just getting out there in the world. All my friends and brother went to university. Most of these bands were in university. I was in high school. So that was one good thing is that I wanted to get out and go to university and be with my buddy. So at least I didn't drop out of school. That was good. Yeah, I just wanted to get out. I wanted to get out of Ottawa and get out to the world. I spent a lot of my time before vice just traveling.

[01:10:04.740] - Speaker 1
And then when we did vice, I spent most of half my year on the road. I love, excuse me, going to see as much as I can.

[01:10:15.170] - Speaker 2
How do you think growing up in Canada impacted your outlook on the world?

[01:10:22.290] - Speaker 1
Canada is weird because we're sanctimonious. We're like, We get more than foreign aid than everybody else. We do this and this. We also gave reactors to India and Pakistan. So don't do anything bad with them. They both exploded an atomic weapon. It's a sanctimonious place, but it's a great place to grow up. It's like the definition of the Canadian character is we're not American. And vice was beloved in Canada until we went to the States. We're like, yeah, we love America. America is great. It's the only place you could come with no shoes. I came from Costa Rica, and I had literally no shoes because someone stole my boots. I had flip flop. You could become a million. It's the only country in the world you can do that. It's amazing. Canadians are like, Fuck you. They wanted us to hate the States. I'm like, I love the States. I think it's great. Now, this is this whole political fear. Like, politics, it's ugly. It's an ugly country, and you have homeless people living right next to the richest people. We could do a better job. It definitely could be, especially it's the richest country in the world.

[01:11:32.670] - Speaker 1
It could be managed better, and it should be managed better. I think you get that from Canada, but you also get like, We're better than you because we're not that way. But we're also really small and really rich. I think there's a lot of countries that are sanctimonious because they're tiny and rich. If you're tiny and rich, you can get out a lot of the problems that the big countries have. India has 300,000 people who would be considered middle class. They have a billion people that are poor that you have to pull up into that middle class. That's a huge job. I don't have any water. These are massive, massive, massive. Canada is a massive country with tons of money. Anyway, it was a great place to grow. It gives you a perspective of being one step away and being able to see stuff and say, you can see, for example, the political spectrum in the States and go, you see it a bit more for what it is rather than, I was born into it. It's like a sports team or something. It's going to be the Philly's Until I Die thing.

[01:12:47.520] - Speaker 2
You have a little more perspective because you're coming from the outside. How would you describe your temperament?

[01:12:57.080] - Speaker 1
Oh, my Lord. That's a good one. Much changed. I mean, I was very hard-charging. I was like, I speak French, why don't you speak French? Why don't we all just know this? I was very aggressive and probably a bit arrogant. But a calm... She never did a good captain make. When I was the Blue-Eye Boy down the hill catching money. I was the smartest guy in every room. Then after a few belts to the head, you're like, You know what? We should maybe think a bit more and listen them a bit more and read a bit more. I think now, probably much happier. I'm pretty lucky. I've been happy most of my life. But comprehensively happier. I much more contemplate things. I think about things more. I think it was Carl Sagan who said, It's insane with all the billions of years that it took to get to this point. We live in this tiny little eye blink of the air works and the temperature work, this work. But not only that, if you look within that envelope of human existence, we got to live in the only era ever without major wars. We didn't get stabbed with fucking pitchfork.

[01:14:42.720] - Speaker 1
And food is delicious. It's not like this rotten fucking moldy bread. And all foods are… You can travel around the world. Our era, and God knows if that… That's the other thing. I don't know if the HBO era continues going on. Let's say the Gen X here. The Gen X here is pretty goddamn good. I'm very thankful that my envelope happened to be probably the greatest envelope of human existence. So that's good. And now also, when Bill called me to do this thing, I'm like, people want me to get back in the game. I was watching this thing about ages of America. That if you're If you're 40 and you don't have a plan, you're fucked. And if you're 50, just fucking... And for us, we still get to fucking do what we love to do. That's a fucking blessing. We're not like, Oh, you're fucking old. You can't do anything. Like family, like happiness at a cellular level. I think I learned a lot. It's funny. I studied philosophy in university, and I think it's completely the ask backwards. We should study philosophy What are you doing now? Because you read it. But when you're a kid, you're like, I don't fucking know.

[01:16:04.820] - Speaker 1
What do I need to write to get a name? So now I read a lot more. I also appreciate pretty much everything. But being able to get back in the game and being able to do something with a little bit more understanding of the complexities of it and a little bit more understanding of, look, there has to be some place where people can go where they believe in what you're saying. I could retire and fucking live my serene existence, which, by the way, is great. But if you can still do something and use your skill set to do something that isn't shitty, then that's just fucking great. So comprehensively happy, but grateful to still be in the mix and grateful that the arrogance and We were a self-fulfilling prophecy, and I used to say, If I don't believe it, who else is going to believe it? You have to believe it. Perhaps that's why I was so hard charging, because I'm like, We're just making this up as we go along. Now, I don't have to do that anymore. So you're just like, Okay, let's look at this and let's try to do it right.

[01:17:18.020] - Speaker 2
Also, your hard charging achieved a tremendous amount. I mean, it's insane what you accomplished.

[01:17:25.990] - Speaker 1
And nobody believed it. Everyone would say no. That's why we You had to get self-fulfilling profit. You had to be like, We're going to do this. We're going to do this. Because nobody says yes. We're going to go from $15,000 to the largest private company in America. They're like, Yeah, no. We're going to be the biggest. The reason why Canadians got mad at us was we're the biggest ever media outlet to come out of Canada. And we went, Yeah, we're going to America. We love it. They were like, Fuck you. It was definitely We didn't know what we were doing. Then when we put the Bad News Bears together, we just struck this alchemy. At one point, we were making the best content in the world. There was a time when you're just like, I knew you can't keep the team together, but it was just a fucking great feeling. That was a really great feeling. Also to be vindicated when everybody says, You can't do it, you can't do it, you can't do it, and then you do it.

[01:18:26.800] - Speaker 2
When did Tom Fruston get involved?

[01:18:30.110] - Speaker 1
That's a great question. Tom is the best guy. I love him to bit. I don't know if you know his story.

[01:18:38.180] - Speaker 2
I don't really.

[01:18:39.350] - Speaker 1
So he was a hippie, hitchhiked around, ended up in Afghanistan. I didn't know that. Started a company in Afghanistan, and Delhi, clothing company. It was like hippie thread, and had a whole life. And then the communists, the Russians came into Kabul, lost everything. I think he was 38 or something.

[01:19:07.410] - Speaker 2
Wow, grown up.

[01:19:08.580] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. But had a life, was a millionaire, lost everything, flew back, and then Pitman said, Oh, we're doing this thing. You know how to sell shit. You sell pants and stuff. He became head of marketing at MTV. Then when they sold it, all the other guys had equity except for him.I.

[01:19:28.020] - Speaker 2
Didn't know that either.Yeah..

[01:19:29.310] - Speaker 1
They all laughed, and then he was the only one left. They were like, You want to be? He went to run it? He said, I guess so. Ends up becoming CEO of Viacom. Super smart guy, amazing person. He gets ousted because Redstone is going nuts. Philippe Daumen, who used to be his lawyer, gets in the golem or whatever his name. And then Tom started working with us, and he really wanted us to be big, to be, let's say, basically, fuck you to MTV. He did it again. And so we traveled all over the world together. He would come to Afghanistan, and he would come to Sudan. He was an older guy. He fucking loved it. He loved being on the road. He loved going to these places. When we were at the peak of our success, they did this thing where we were three times the size of MTV. Mtv, when we did the deal with Tom, I had a deal, a cause where Tom last week to buy it back. We did. We bought it back for a book value, which was $4 million at the time. Then it was worth whatever. When they did the article, it was $4 billion.

[01:20:39.600] - Speaker 1
They're like, Oh, that $4 million turned into $4 billion. Tom loved it, and we loved Tom. He's one of the last entertainment gurus. These guys back in the day were larger than life, and now they're just lawyers with fucking Police Best. But he was a hell of a fucking... Still is, he's a hell of a character.

[01:21:07.110] - Speaker 2
Who were some of the suiters who wanted to buy Vice over the years? Everybody.

[01:21:12.810] - Speaker 1
We had A deal done with Time Warner for 49 % because I wanted to get a TV network. So we were going to get HLN, and we were done. And then a guy came and he said, Go talk to Bob Iger. And everyone was like, fucking, this is not ever going to deal with deal advice. It's funny. I walked in and he said, I want to talk to you about copyright infringement because in one of our pictures, there was a huge dildo next to a frozen cup. And he's like, I want to talk to you about copyright infringement. He was joking. And I was like, oh, he's a very fucking smart guy. And he said, look, you've given these guys nine months, give me nine days. So I delayed my trip back to New York. We worked out a deal. I went back, told Time Warner, I wasn't going to come in. And they, five minutes later, the New York Times, boom, they dropped the story like, Couldn't agree on price, i. E, I was too greedy. Then two minutes later, we released our story with Disney at 2.5. So we had 800 million of value in a week.

[01:22:17.940] - Speaker 1
Wait. 3, 4. 4 o'clock.How great is the bell?4 o'clock is a good time.

[01:22:27.820] - Speaker 2
I love the bell.

[01:22:28.420] - Speaker 1
Does somebody have to do that?

[01:22:29.750] - Speaker 2
No, it's aIt's an automatic?

[01:22:31.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That's awesome.Yeah, 9:00 to 9:00.It's awesome.Yeah..

[01:22:33.920] - Speaker 2
We were talking about Disney. You meet with Bob Iger.It.

[01:22:40.810] - Speaker 1
Was the question of money.You.

[01:22:41.390] - Speaker 2
Give him nine days.

[01:22:43.360] - Speaker 1
Oh, it was suiters. So Southerners, so it's everyone from Rupert Murdoch. That's another person. Everyone, Rupert Murdoch is the devil, Rupert Murdoch is the devil, blah, blah, blah. You're like, Yeah, he got Labor elected in the UK. Labor being communists here in America, he wanted access to power. That's what he does. He doesn't give a fuck if it's Bright Wing now, maybe because he's older. But back in the day, he would just get access to power anyway. Rupert wanted to buy at one point. Jeff Bukas, the time Warner, another great guy, Jeff. Tom wanted a bias before that, and then Bob Iger. Yeah, so that's one thing is everyone's like, Oh, Shane said no to Disney, now they're bankrupt. Which is a great story. It's not true. Because I said yes to Disney.

[01:23:36.090] - Speaker 2
Well, you said yes to Time Warner first.

[01:23:37.910] - Speaker 1
I've never said no to money. I'm a capitalism. Said yes to Time Warner, then Disney outbid them. Yes. Then we were working to sell Disney, the whole company. There was a time when Disney was trying to buy Snapchat and/or Spotify. I know Daniel, and I was good friends with Evan, so I was trying to get in there, get in to At some point, Spotify and/or Snapchat said, We're too big. We're not going to do it. They said, Put a hold on the whole vice, because we were going to be the content part of this platform thing. Then that's turned into Shane said, No. Then they went bankrupt. I never said, No, I would love to be part of a bigger platform. And that's, in fact, what we were building the whole company to be. And then because Disney pulled the bug. That's when we got into private equity. And private equity is like scoping in the frog. They're like, Yeah, we'll value it six and a half billion. Fuck, let's go. But then they put in all the ratchets and the things. And look, private equity do what they do. They're going to end up owning your company no matter what you do.

[01:24:47.840] - Speaker 1
That was probably not great. We were built for a strategic, i. E.

[01:24:54.480] - Speaker 2
Like a-A real partner.

[01:24:56.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:24:58.060] - Speaker 2
Tell me some expert advice you along the way that turned out to be really wrong.

[01:25:02.500] - Speaker 1
All of it.

[01:25:04.360] - Speaker 2
All of it. Give me some examples.

[01:25:07.480] - Speaker 1
Private equity. We always had a rule. For every It was a page of content. We had to have a page of ads because it was a business. If you don't pay for it, it's going to die. I was always really into sales. I was always really into driving revenue. Then the whole company, including me, got caught up in this weird valuation game of just building up the valuation rather than selling and taking the money in and making it. You were just taking in higher and higher valuations.

[01:25:58.300] - Speaker 2
How much of your time was that taking versus on focusing on the content?

[01:26:02.280] - Speaker 1
That's a great question. The advice I give to media kids and people who came in device and stuff, I'd say, Look, concentrate on two things, content and revenue. That's what a media company is. Make great content and then monetize it. Now, it sounds like simplistic advice. Everyone will try to take everything away. It'll be HR, it'll be lawsuits, it'll be courtroom battles, it'll be proxy votes, it'll be rights offerings, it'll be raising money. People like it. It's lawyers, and it's hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's exciting. Making content and selling brands is difficult. People get sucked up into it, and I think that happens to all media companies, I think that's what's happened not only in new media, but in legacy media, because if you look at what's happening now, they have to consolidate and fire everybody because they're just They're not driving revenue or interesting ways of having because everybody's advertising based. And as we talked about, the big five are taking all the advertising. So they haven't innovated. They haven't got into sub-base. They haven't got into anything new. And so they're just sitting there. Nobody's concentrating on revenue. No one's concentrating on making great content except for Amazon and Netflix, because they can, because they have the money.

[01:27:26.790] - Speaker 1
I mean, Amazon, pretty soon no one's going to be able to compete with Amazon because they just do content as an add-on.They don't need to make anything.They don't need to make anything. Because they're going to sell everything in the world. And pretty soon the content is going to be like, Oh, it's going to be hot clicks. I want those jeans. I want that bottle. And you're just going to be able to click anything on an Amazon and just be able to buy. It's genius. Who's going to be able to compete with that? No one can compete with that. Can't compete now. So private equity, you always think that you can control the beast, and you never can. What else has it told me? Most of the advice of the day-to-day stuff is always bad. It's mostly lawyers. For example, we were going to do the vice, going to have it in the vice book, the be-all and end-all story of vice, the two stories. The two stories is phenomenal. We started writing it, and the lawyers were like, Yeah, this is like 50 different lawsuits. This is going to be insane. And you're like, Okay, well, fuck it.

[01:28:41.400] - Speaker 1
We won't do it. So we didn't do it.

[01:28:42.500] - Speaker 2
Just telling the truth.

[01:28:43.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And then now the narratives are being... We always used to say that, if you don't write your own narrative, then someone else is going to write it. It's not going to be your narrative or the truth. And so we didn't do it. And then now everybody's just writing the narrative, which is obviously like disgruntled employees or this or that or whatever. It's not going to be... Nobody who's inside and who actually knew about the growth and knew. That's We shouldn't listen to those lawyers.

[01:29:18.420] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your experiences currency trading.

[01:29:27.280] - Speaker 1
Well, it sounds a lot, I don't know, sexier. Anyway, I went to Eastern Europe. When I was studying politics-How old are you at this time? 21, 22. I was studying East European Soviet studies in college, and then the Soviet Union goes away. It was the hardest school to get into for politics. I'm like, Okay, well, they went away. I went to Eastern Europe. I I went to I went to Prague, which was where everybody went, but it was already inundated. Then I went to Budapest, and I taught business English. Then I was teaching business English, and all these guys were like, You as a foreigner can get a, like a foreign company, and you can buy currency. It's much better rate than the black market, which is like... I had this book, and I was buying selling foreign... All of a sudden, I didn't have to do the school anymore. I was making a lot of money. I had a car and driver. I lived in the same building as the Prime Minister. I had tailor-made suits. By the way, this is the punk kid. It's really interesting. Yeah, it was super fun, except for when the Romanians, Translvanians, who were running real money laundering with bad guys, start catch wind that you're taking their business.

[01:30:53.850] - Speaker 1
It got very hot for a minute. My brother said, Oh, I'm getting married. I'm like, You know what? I'm going to take a little break. But it was basically all money trading. There's a difference between the arbitrage between the black market rate and the other rate. What saved my ass was that because I was doing it with companies, I was out of the spotlight of the bad boys for long enough to make some money. But what I realized about that, so that's a good question, but the real thing I realized was I'd been poor for so long, that that was my first taste of money, although it was not real because you couldn't leave hungry with it. But what I would do, I would go to Venice. I would work and get my money, and I would be rich and hungry, but the minute you left, you were poor. But I would go to Venice for the weekend and stay at the Danielli and Bacchimula. And to a poor kid from Ottawa, this was just like your fucking brain was exploding. And then I'd go back, but you couldn't ever really Eastern Europe because the differentiation was so much.

[01:32:05.510] - Speaker 2
What was Budapest like?

[01:32:06.440] - Speaker 1
Oh, my God.Beautiful.

[01:32:07.620] - Speaker 2
Place.oh.

[01:32:07.820] - Speaker 1
My Lord. Paris and East. It's gorgeous, and it was not destroyed. It was no fast food. There was no signs. There was no neon. It was just fucking beautiful. Speaking of, it had Roman baths. It was known for the bath. It had baths everywhere, like hot baths, go to this bunch.

[01:32:30.580] - Speaker 2
That's where the water culture was invented, the bathing culture.

[01:32:35.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah, huge. It was massive complexes in Roman bath. Incredible food culture, incredible wine culture. How long did you get to live there? Two It was just fucking lovely. I got to say that it just was opening up, and they were very excited. We were very excited. Did people speak English? Now, It was before, it was more German.

[01:33:03.560] - Speaker 2
How did you communicate?

[01:33:06.020] - Speaker 1
A little bit of Hungarian, a little bit of English, a little bit of German. Now, they speak English. Hungary is a beautiful country. But Budapest is staggeringly beautiful. Yeah, living there and being like... You felt like James Bond. My car was a muskets car, like the old Russian. You're trading money and you're like, Yeah, this is fucking cool. Now, that's not going to go on very long. When I came back and they said, Can you come and let's do vice together, that was probably saved my life. But the one thing about that is after you get a taste of that lifestyle, you're like, Fuck. I want to go back to my dad. The one piece of advice he gave me was, Life is like a shit sandwich. The more bread you have, the less shit you have to eat. It's true. When you have a little bit of cash, it's fucking nice. That was the first thing that ever gave me a taste.

[01:34:03.760] - Speaker 2
Did you ever think about staying there? Yeah. Just that the quality of life was so good.

[01:34:09.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I did. I mean, there's a few things. I came back from there and found myself going, Hello, Rick. How are you? Are you feeling fine? Because... That's the thing. I don't know, Scooby-Doo. It's like a dog. It's a cartoon. There's no cultural references. You're wearing weird clothes. You become hodgepodge, personally. People, they were talking about music because I'd grown up in music and stuff. There's a whole new music wave going on. There was a whole new... Everyone dressed different. Everyone talked different. I'm like, Oh, I'm fucking off to it.

[01:34:55.260] - Speaker 2
It felt like you were missing out on culture.

[01:34:58.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Just being able to talk was a big deal. And comfort food and stuff. I thought about going back, but at that point, I was loving. I mean, again, I moved back to Montreal, which, again, is one of my favorite places in the world. It wasn't terrible. It was great. Montreal was great. But, yeah, the one place that stuck with me was Greece. I was always like, Greece to me was always my utopia.

[01:35:32.220] - Speaker 2
How were you involved in Greenpeace?

[01:35:34.640] - Speaker 1
My first job out of college was Greenpeace Canada. I started out as a fundraiser, and then I ran fundraising, and then I ended up with a couple of other people running Greenpeace Canada, which is part of Greenpeace. Then I went to Switzerland, because the Greens got elected at that point, they had 32% of the parliament. I was very politically active. When I was here in Italy, I joined Parti Ci Comuniste Italia, went to Umria, worked for Greenpeace, was very environmentally active for a number of years. Then went to Eastern Europe, the program was called Education for Democracy, which is basically go teach people English, but at the same time, talk about how democracy works and liberal democracy. So very politically active. And then That, I think, later on, that's why I veered off from the fashion and music and stuff into more political commentary.

[01:36:44.650] - Speaker 2
Of the pieces that you worked on, are there any that got wildly popular that you never would have guessed would have been popular? Were there any that you thought would have been really popular that nobody cared about? Tell me about that.

[01:36:58.190] - Speaker 1
Napoleon said Conquest has made me, and Conquest lets sustain me. Basically, North Korea made me, and Conquest lets sustain me. North Korea was insane. North Korea was... I went from nothing to hundreds and hundreds of millions of video views. When you look back on the experience, forgetting the content aspect, was it a good experience in your life?

[01:37:23.000] - Speaker 2
From your perspective, going there and having the experiences you had.

[01:37:27.200] - Speaker 1
The experience is like being on acid for a week. It's not You're being watched the whole time. It's fucking weird. Like it's-Weirdest place you've ever been?Times a billion. Really? It's fucking so weird.

[01:37:42.610] - Speaker 2
You've been in weird places.

[01:37:43.680] - Speaker 1
I highly recommend going, Because it's-Can anybody go? No. That's the problem. But it's basically a theme park for 1950s Stalinist Russia, 1960s, now it's China. Total cult of personality. Every room, two pictures, everybody, state police. It's like going to Disneyland of what the world used to be under Stalin and Mao. It's crazy. And also studying that stuff. So it was phenomenally interesting. Terrifying. State police run. And And by the way, we're lucky that we live here and not there. Holy shit. There's stories of going to concentration camps and people eating the kern of corn out of a cow shit. It's bad. But it's the most interesting. For example, the first time I went, we went to the Aerie Rang Games. It's the largest stadium in the world, and they get the best and the brightest to practice for a year to do this thing, the Aerie Rang Games. And it's basically, I don't know, 150,000 people And then they do pixels, like they're human pixels. And they go,. And they do this thing where they do highly choreographed things where it's the whole history of Korea, the Communist history of Korea, by 150,000 people doing this fucking thing with pixels, and then people flying through the air and the and just-So is it cheerleaders, would you say?

[01:39:27.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's like a floor show of maybe 50,000 people doing choreograph, like, no, here's an island, and now here's this, and now here's Mount Erie Rang, and then here comes a song, which is these 50,000 people here. And then in the background, There's literally pixels. I have to show it to you. But they do a thing where it's like TV, but made of humans doing choreograph pixels, 100,000 of them. I'm sitting at the dias where Kim Ilson used the first one. There's maybe me and some generals and no one else. It's 150,000 people doing this thing a year.

[01:40:08.520] - Speaker 2
Performing for you and a handful of people.

[01:40:10.390] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Generals and stuff. Wow. You're like, What the fuck? You're What is going on here? What is going on? That was the craziest thing that ever happened. I shot it. I can show you the thing because people wouldn't believe me. I shot myself with nobody there. Then there's the fucking thing. That's That was crazy.

[01:40:32.250] - Speaker 2
How did you get permission to go?

[01:40:34.740] - Speaker 1
That year, there was... So we got refused. That year, there were flood, which is why I was one of the only people there. They hadn't done the area-run games for two years, but that year, they had to do them because the Chinese something, the delegation was coming. So they wanted to get a few practice runs in. And what I was told was they were going to refuse everybody before the Chinese come. But if you go to Shin-Yang, which is an industrial city in Northern China, right on the Korean border, you can go to the Korean embassy and pay an entrance fee. The whole thing was crazy. We went to Shin-Yang, and we're not going to tell you if you can get in or not. We paid the entrance fee. They make you stay in a North Korean hotel there, which literally has concrete beds. You're like, What the fuck? Really? Yeah. They come in at 2:00 in the morning. They take your passport. They take everything. They go, Come on, They put you in this fucking shitty military bus. They take you to the military airport, and they put you on an old two-plef, like an old aluminum fucking Russian plane, and you fly into Pyongya, and you're like, Holy fucking shit.

[01:41:46.150] - Speaker 1
We made it. We're in. Then from the second you get there, you're like, What is that?

[01:41:51.780] - Speaker 2
Did you have any feeling that you wouldn't be able to get out? Was that ever a feeling?

[01:41:55.260] - Speaker 1
We got caught filming. What we did, because we were fucking stupid, is we got these point-and-shoot cameras.

[01:42:07.360] - Speaker 2
Were you not allowed to take it?

[01:42:08.690] - Speaker 1
Well, you can go to specific areas and take a picture, and then when they say yes, But what we were doing is we got these... It was basically the first time where you could get a big memory card. We put a memory card, and you could shoot film on your camera. We would be like, I'm just taking a picture. We were doing that because you have a guide, a guard, and then the secret police. I remember the secret police guy was watching us. We got probably a bit too cocky. Then he was like, Say, give me that. I gave it to him and he goes, Why do you have a, whatever, 250-meg photo card? Because he was like, I guess, 18. I don't remember the numbers, but it was like 10 times as it should have been. I was like, I don't know. I just laid out. I'm I have no idea. I was in the airport, and I bought it, and that's the only one. But that was our Dodge. They knew that I knew that they knew. Then I started going, Oh, shit. They know. They know that we're fucking filming this fucking thing.

[01:43:16.510] - Speaker 1
That was scary because one guy on that trip had a camera. Because they put you in a hotel, which is like a... It's It's like hotel murder. It's like this concrete box, and you go in and it's just a concrete room. You imagine the carpet's been soaked in blood many times. It's like there's a thing there. It's like a '50s radio, but it's just listening to you. You can hear it listening to you. It's on an island, right? You can't get off. You're not allowed to go do anything. You can't do anything unless there's guards there and all that shit. You can't go. It's all choreographed. This guy tried to fucking get off the island and go shoot, and he got caught. They're like, Yeah, you're going to jail for a long time. Something happened. I don't know. They kicked him out. He didn't end up having to go to a concentration. You have what you don't want. But they're very fucking serious.

[01:44:12.940] - Speaker 2
Did you get to see how the regular people live at all?

[01:44:16.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, and it's fucking wild. There's one that became most famous. I actually interact with people. It was like, We stopped at a tea shop and I played pool with a tea girl who's been in the tea shop for five years playing pool. She was really good at playing pool. But nobody comes in because there's no fucking tourist. Everyone's like, What happened to the tea girl? Because she's really cute and really sweet. They're like, The tea girl. We got to get the tea girl. Then I went to the DMZ and You do your DMZ shit, whatever. But on the way back, you see villages. The village, it's so fucked up because they don't build villages with houses and stuff. They build villages which will just be in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing. It's like forest. Then there'll be a 50-story Stalinist apartment building, the massive Russian ones. It's huge. That's the village. It's one building, two buildings. It's one and then one big empathy for political whatever, endocrinization. And then that's it. It's like, what the fuck? But because they have no money, they sold all the windows. So all the windows, 50 stories up, have been taken out.

[01:45:29.300] - Speaker 1
They've sold They've taken out the rebar to sell it to the Chinese. So it looks like this pockmarked. It looks like it's been eaten by like woodpeckers that eat concrete.

[01:45:39.610] - Speaker 2
And people live in it.

[01:45:40.480] - Speaker 1
But wait, so there's no... And there's no electricity now. So they have You see on the 50th floor, you'll see cooking fires. They're carding up 50 stories water. They don't have it. There's no running water. They go get water from the stream and lumber 50 stories up to their apartment where they cook cooking fires, and you're like, What? You see at night, if you're ever out at night, which you're not allowed to be, people with scissors.

[01:46:11.200] - Speaker 2
You weren't allowed to be or nobody's allowed to be?

[01:46:13.270] - Speaker 1
Well, no, Westerners. Okay. That's what we're doing. We're allowed to go out. Because Kim Jongun came to our basketball game, all of a sudden, they're like, Oh, now we're going to show you this, and now we're going to do this. Because everyone has the same footage because they give you the same tour. All of a sudden, we had all this new footage that nobody else had, and that's why we got all this shit. It was like, oh, vice a stunt journalist, vice versa. But we had the footage that nobody else had. Yeah, North Korea is not a place you want to live.

[01:46:40.010] - Speaker 2
Tell me the whole story of the basketball game. It's a wild idea.

[01:46:45.570] - Speaker 1
They have this mountain. The whole of North Korea is wild. But they have this mountain, and they have the Hall of Treasures, which is every treasure that's been given to either Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, or Kim Jong-un. And so it literally would take you two weeks to go through the whole thing. Sorry. It's two miles down a mountain. So they hauled out a mountain. So you go down this mountain, and inside the mountain, they have the first train that Stalin gave Kim Il-sang. A train 2 miles down to a mountain because they have to be fucking protected because they're treasures. But there'll be a bar coaster that Fidel Castro side. There's so much shit. You go through and through. It's weird, weird stuff, like an alligator from some guy from Nicaragua, whatever. So you go through. Oh, yeah. There's also a wax figure of Kim Il Song and Kim Jong-il with a fan blowing their hair. And everyone has to go there because they're still... And bow to them. By the way, as a North Korean, you have to go there one time in your life, see the treasures, and literally 10 feet away the dear leader and the President for Life is this basketball signed by Michael Jordan.

[01:48:07.010] - Speaker 1
I was like, That's so fucking weird. It was the first time a rapper small since the Korean War with America, Adlyn Albright. They love the Bulls, et cetera. We came up with the idea, why don't we just do a fucking ping-pong diplomacy in China? We're going to do basketball. I'll send you the doc. The doc is heartwarming because the Harlem Globeshotters were the stars. I mean, those guys are fucking amazing. They played the North Korean national team. He showed up to the game, which was fucking insane because the people went apeshit because he's like, God, they They could say Mance.

[01:48:45.830] - Speaker 2
Happy?

[01:48:46.920] - Speaker 1
Oh, they say Mance, which means 10,000 years or something. They're just like, Mance. Like crazy for, I don't know, half an hour.

[01:48:55.930] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[01:48:57.400] - Speaker 1
Then, which was really fucked up, is they said to the crew, Yeah, come back to my house. The whole crew went back to his house for like 12 hours. Kim Jong Un? Yeah. Then, because of that, we got access to everything.

[01:49:14.970] - Speaker 2
What was his house like?

[01:49:16.290] - Speaker 1
I wasn't allowed to go. For that trip, which I set up, during that time, I was banned. I've since been back because what happens is I do a documentary, and then they get mad at me. I see. They ban me, and They say, Okay, I can come back, and then I do it again. That one I set up, but they're like, Yeah, you're not coming on this one, buddy.

[01:49:38.080] - Speaker 2
That sounds like a great...

[01:49:40.840] - Speaker 1
The doc is amazing. It sounds amazing. The doc is great. At the end, the Heart of Georgia. You see these little kids and their eyes light up, and they're just... That's what I like doing it because they're just regular people. We're like, Northsgrane, it's a fucking Northsgrane. They're fucking Norsegno, and fucking bombs, and lasers and shit. You see, they're just kids. They're just kids who like basketball, and They're just stoked to see somebody. The greatest thing about that is that you realize that it's all propaganda. Everything is propaganda. Anyway, that's the one that surprised me in the West and North Korea. The one that surprised me that didn't hit as much as it should have is we took the first sitting president to a prison to talk about prison reform, got two-Sitting President of what country?

[01:50:34.650] - Speaker 2
Obama. You took Obama.

[01:50:36.880] - Speaker 1
No president's ever gone to a prison. He had to lie to the DOJ and DOP. Really? Yeah, it was a big deal. Wow. It was a hugeHow are we able to orchestrate it? Biden came out to vice in Williamsburg for a day. They had snipers on the roof and all this shit. Wow. He came in to basically vet us, that we would do it, went to a prison in Oklahoma Oklahoma to talk about 56 % at that time, 56 % of all prisoners, which is obviously 25 % of all prisoners in the world or in America, 56 % of them were nonviolent drug offenses, most of them weed. We did a lot on weed, and always have done a lot of weed and decriminalizing, et cetera. We went to Oklahoma, where something, I don't know, 70% population of maximum security were three-time offended, like the three strikes you're at.

[01:51:37.700] - Speaker 2
For weed.

[01:51:38.640] - Speaker 1
For weed.

[01:51:39.570] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:51:40.590] - Speaker 1
We went there with Obama and won an Emmy I got two bills passed, bipartisan bills on reform, crime reform, prison reform, prison reform. It just didn't hit. Really? It didn't rate. It was very serious, but it's Obama in the fucking prison, freeing prisons for weed. I thought that would hit, and it didn't. The one that hit, actually, the Because we did the prisoner reform one, he gave me unlimited access to the last six months of his presidency. I was going to give him a blow job. We were just going to say, Hey, fucking good job. All they wanted to talk about was the Tea Party and John Boehner and how fucking dysfunctional America was and how fucking city of Republicans. It was them. So I went, okay, now I'll go talk to John Boehner, who's a great guy, by the way. Went to go talk to John Boehner, then went to talk to the Tea Party guys. John Boehner, which I didn't know, speaking of how things work, speaker, famously him and Obama. John Boehner got ousted by the Tea Party because he even met with Obama. He was doing his job, and he actually was very...

[01:53:02.250] - Speaker 1
He was like a political mechanic, and he would get shit done, and he was like a whip, and he would fucking go do stuff, and he'd go meet Obama, whatever. Just for meeting with the guy, that was his fucking job. The Republicans ousted him, and he's a conservative. He was a conservative. And so Obama was like, Look, our political institutions are under attack. Whether that's a long... Democracy is blah, blah, blah. And this Trump thing is going to be an issue. And He called it. He said, This is going to get a lot worse. That hit. That was, I think, our biggest show on HBO. But the Prison One, which was an excellent episode, it didn't hit. That's what I thought would, for our audience, especially, Weed and prisms and Obama, you think like, All right.

[01:53:55.380] - Speaker 2
How is running something big different than running something small?

[01:54:00.520] - Speaker 1
Running something small is all about how do I survive? How do we keep the lights on? If something bad happens, what is it they say? Americans don't have $586 if there's a catastrophe. That's running a small business. It's like, if something happens, we're fucked. I remember so many... We had stores, and I remember so many times the mag, an ad wouldn't come in, and so we'd have to go clear out the fucking... The tills from the stores to pay. It's robbing from Peter to pay Paul. Then when you're big, it's like boardroom, lawyers, One of the reasons why I went to LA and got out of it is I'm good at creating content. I'm good at brand building and revenue. I'm bad at lawyers and boardroom politics and all the stuff that you have to when you become a company. It's a different thing. It's a different thing. It's also terrible. I just don't like it. And it's false. Everyone's lying. That whole scorpion in the front thing. Look, success has many parents, and failure is an orphan. So when you're rolling down the hill catching money, everyone's your best friend. And the minute something goes wrong, that guy.

[01:55:28.290] - Speaker 1
So the fun stuff is The fun stuff is building, the fun stuff is making, the fun stuff is, Hey, let's go to-When it gets big, it becomes essentially a corporate job. It's a corporate job, and you have a lot of people that you have to appease. And quite frankly, you shouldn't appease them. You shouldn't do what you're going to do.

[01:55:45.130] - Speaker 2
Did you ever have advertisers complain about the content?

[01:55:50.450] - Speaker 1
That's a big question. You know who's the blame for censorship and who's the blame for... Is advertiser on both sides. Because we would do something and our audience would go up, but the advertisers were like, We don't know about that. By the way, nobody's safe. Even the right, a lot of people go to the right because the left is so sketchy. If the advertisers take a second out, you're gone. They don't care. So the right, at least they'll stand by you more. Even Tucker Carlson got ex. The advertisers, they're the modern-day The answer. They're the ones that are, In fact, we did a thing. We actually want to-What's their motivation, though?

[01:56:38.860] - Speaker 2
If the goal of an advertiser-They wanted to be brand safe.

[01:56:43.210] - Speaker 1
We did a campaign which won the first glass line or diamond line or crystal line or whatever it was. They had 10 lines because we did a brand safety campaign where like, homosexual, like gay, black, all of these were in brand safety guidelines for all these brands, for the majority of brands. These were seen as negative terms that they didn't want their brand next to. We're like, You want your name next to black? You want your name next to homosex? This is this? 1953? We actually did a whole thing to reedit this brand safety dictionary because we were getting nailed on everything for brand safety. They don't want their brands next to anything risque. You're like, Well, that's what it is.

[01:57:40.240] - Speaker 2
It's called vice.

[01:57:41.410] - Speaker 1
Exactly. But they are the modern-day sensors. If If you pull their money, their advertising, then you're fucked.

[01:57:49.310] - Speaker 2
What would you say are the biggest takeaways from the whole vice experience?

[01:57:54.310] - Speaker 1
Look, we lasted 30 years, which most people don't. It lasted a lot longer than I thought it was going to last. I wish it had ended differently. Well, it's not over, but I wish my part of it ended differently. The takeaway was the greatest thing in the world for about 15 years. Really, this is the bad news, bears. We had people who didn't know how to shoot, who revolutionized shooting. We had people who'd never cut anything before becoming the best editor. We never had any professional host. It was just, Hey, you, go, fuck. Baby balls. We got him as a joke because he was 92 pounds, soaking wet with halitosis and dendro. He became our fucking most non-feerless fucking man in the street. We did it. So much of it we did as a joke. People just resonated with it. I think that was when it was really fun. We were literally the bad news there. We were shitty at everything individually. But if we put them together, there's this weird alchemy, this symbiosis that that led to this unique way of shooting and cutting and telling stories. But for a while, it was great.

[01:59:11.160] - Speaker 1
Then we got too big, and also everyone caught up. People started sending me like, ABC news and CBS news stuff that looked exactly like vice.

[01:59:20.220] - Speaker 2
You set a standard that then got copied?

[01:59:23.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah, 100%. They look and feel. Then people would just say, Well, just do that. I But I mean, you could work for Vice and get a job back in the day when there still were jobs in media like that because they wanted to just rip it off. Which is funny because a lot of times it was like the Borg, like when you left the collectives, because Because it was no secret sauce to Vice. It was like the editor would stay, excuse me, 24 hours to fucking cut the thing and polish the turd. The shooter would just fucking stay there to get the shot no matter what happened. The host would be like, I'm not leaving until I can, or ask the questions that nobody else would ask. All of that together made to this weird alchemy. That's one thing I missed because I don't know that you'll ever work with a team that you'll put together like that again because nobody in their right mind is going to put together a team that's never done it.

[02:00:22.650] - Speaker 2
Would you say what unified it all was the attitude? Would that be right?

[02:00:29.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Also, I think a lot of people couldn't get jobs, and they were just like, Well, this is my shot, so I'm going to give it my all. And there's a lot of... We used to come up with tag lines that we thought were funny. My favorite was rumored to be among the best. That's really funny. Rumored to be among the best. But we had one for a while, which is less shittier. I forget what it was. Less shittier than everybody else. And that used to be our line, just let's less shitty than everybody else because everything's so shit by and large. And then you're just like, Let's try to be just not shitty. I think that was the real ethos that people would be like, Come on, fucking that's shitty. The majority of stuff that comes in is just not great. You're like, Okay, let's try to make it good.

[02:01:18.700] - Speaker 2
If you were to make a list of the things that worked and a list of the things that didn't work, what would you make those lists for me now? I don't mean content-wise. I mean in building the company. What worked and what didn't?

[02:01:34.260] - Speaker 1
Well, having people... I remember coming into our office on, which was a rabbit war, and we put together 40 offices because we had no money. We We went to that office, and then someone would leave, and we'd get down. It was like tunnels and things. I remember going like, Oh, fuck, I forgot my thing. I went there like, midnight on a Sunday, and it was packed. Wow. Just ran because people were like, That's where they worked. Then they hung out. We had bars in the office and stuff, so people would just drink, and they would just stay there. That's what worked. I'll tell you, when it's us against the world, That's when it worked. When we did well, we bought a whole city block. Not bought it, but put together. It was like the Starship enterprise. It was fucking amazing. It's amazing. It's like edit suites, and everything was fucking… You know what I'm State of the Yard, and we had a farm where we grew our own vegetables and the fucking thing. That's when it went bad because that's when it was us against them, them meeting us, meeting the management of the company.

[02:02:43.210] - Speaker 1
Because when it was all the rabbit warrants and you had to stand and ride for the bathroom, whatever. We were all together. We were all on a mission. There was a time when I lived off of gambling because I didn't have any money. Then when I got I made some money, I gambled a lot, and I made a lot of money. One time, I made so much money that I took the board out for dinner, and I spent a lot of money at dinner. Now, what happened was there was an earnings call for MGM, Bellagio, or whatever. They're like, Vegas is back. There was a big whale. He came in, he spent $400,000 for dinner. Somebody called the restaurant and figured out it was me. Now, what they failed to mention, it was comp. I don't know if you know how comps work, but you can buy a cheese sandwich or you can buy a $400,000 dinner. They don't give you the money. They give you a comp allowance, but if you leave, the comp dies. I'm like, Okay, it's comp.

[02:03:44.620] - Speaker 2
It's free. Because you spent a lot of money gambling?

[02:03:47.070] - Speaker 1
Or you made a lot of money gambling.

[02:03:48.260] - Speaker 2
Okay.

[02:03:49.840] - Speaker 1
Yes, they comped it. When I heard about it, I was like, Yeah, I made a lot of money gambling. I'm a good gambler. And I got comped. But when the story came out that it was 400,000-dollar dinner, that's when it became us versus them. They're like, Shane isn't one of us anymore. That's when the union started and all this stuff. It was us versus them. I see. You're like, Oh, that was bad. To this day, you can't explain to someone. It was comped. It was like, you either take it or you don't. That was bad. Very high up there on the bad list of what not to do.

[02:04:38.200] - Speaker 2
It was the feeling of you guys had made it and everybody else was still struggling.

[02:04:43.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And by the way, we tried to give away equity, and we tried to do that. We did. We gave away a lot of equity. And then I remember we had this thing, and we were like, Would you rather have $10,000 cash or equity? And they're like, $10,000 cash? I'm like, Okay. And I would give my own money because I wanted the equity. But people just wanted money. There were people who also had equity. If you're at a Silicon Valley startup, they know about seed rounds and down It comes and up. Our kids have never had anything. It was like, Where's my money? You're like, Well, it's not public company. It doesn't exist.

[02:05:23.500] - Speaker 2
Did it ever become a public company? It never did. Was it close at any point?

[02:05:27.450] - Speaker 1
We were going to do a SPAC, but every We were a day late in a dollar short. Spacs were hot, I guess, in '22, '21, '22. Then we were going to SPAC in '23. Buzzfeed did a SPAC, and it just died. I think they SPACed at 12 and went up to 15, and now it's at 1. Wow. Spacs became like the devil. We were going to do a SPAC, and then we just said… I mean, everyone was SPACing as a last-ditch effort. I mean, that's the other thing. It's not just us. Like, BuzzFeed, who was number two behind us, did the same thing. At one point, they were like, I don't know, 38 million dollar market cap. You're like, everyone's looking to say, I always say, who left the the porthole open in the Titanic? Well, it hit a fucking iceberg. The iceberg is the big five. The porthole, it just fucking doesn't matter. But everyone's looking for that person who left the porthole. But yeah, what I would say is it's depressing because it means the end. That your last or whatever question before of who's coming up, who's the next vice? That's the shame.

[02:06:42.000] - Speaker 1
There should be somebody who took vice and ate our lunch and is better than us and cooler, global and maybe they're fucking out there. Great. I don't think that there's going to be that. Not because I want to say I'm saying it's because independent publishing is general, unless it's very niche, is gone because it's just all the air is being sucked out of the room. That sucks. That sucks for everybody. What vice was the bellwether for new media and independent media, well, we're also the bellwither for that's not happening anymore, which sucks. The best time of vice were three, which was living in Montreal in a big loft, starting it from scratch, and having your peers go, That's good. That's a good thing. My dad a prick and a tough guy and a harsh taskmaster. I remember I was in Florida at ASR, and he called me up and he was like, How does it feel to not only have the best magazine in Canada, but the best magazine in the world?Wow.That was great.

[02:07:45.860] - Speaker 2
Were you shocked by the call?

[02:07:47.420] - Speaker 1
He's never said that job before. Even now, I'm getting. Anyway, that's the deal. That's beautiful. That time was good. The Planet Brooklyn time was good. But the best time was going country to country. Country and building from scratch in each country, learning a bit about that country, et cetera, et cetera. You'd fly in, you'd spend six months, have a relationship, eat the food, speak the language.

[02:08:12.610] - Speaker 2
That was really fun. Super fun.

[02:08:14.660] - Speaker 1
At the end of the At the end, it was flying to a boardroom for 24 hours, sit with accountants and lawyers, telling you about vice, telling you about protecting vice, and telling you what we should be doing with vice, and then not having any fun, not having any... And then flying out of it. When you realized, I used to have the freedom Because I control the business, to go and build. That's what I'm good at. And by the way, we were spectacularly successful. What I was spectacularly unsuccessful had was flying in, hanging out with lawyers and fucking accountants saying, Here's how you should do it. And you just go, Well, fuck you, which doesn't help anybody either. And then flying out on a plane just going, What the fuck did I just do? That was terrible.

[02:09:09.050] - Speaker 2
Is that the difference between what a founder does and what an operator does? A hundred %. That's the difference.

[02:09:16.100] - Speaker 1
You hit the nail on the head. The founder is like, This is my baby. Let's build. That's great. And the operator goes, Okay, publishing isn't making money. Do it with somebody else. Okay, the studio is killing it. Up with a TV. Tv. Fucking let's do it. That's what an operator does. They know how to manage those boardrooms. They know how to manage those lawyers and accountants. At some point, you have 15 different outside consultants in these meetings, giving you all their whatever. I never knew who McKinsey was, and then all of a sudden, I was surrounded by McKinsey thing. You're like, This is just terrible.

[02:09:55.510] - Speaker 2
How bad were some of the ideas that you would hear?

[02:09:58.420] - Speaker 1
I would say 90% of them were just awful, super bad. It's people who had seen something by vice, and they liked it. Then they come in and say, You know what we should do? We should do this.

[02:10:12.780] - Speaker 2
You're like, That's not it.

[02:10:15.220] - Speaker 1
That was like, shitty 17 years ago. We did it. We're not going to do it again. Most of you, I guess. But lawyers, they all want to be creative, or they all want to do this one. You're like, What are you fucking… Everyone shouldn't have a mustache and wear yellow. You're like, What are you fucking talking about? And everyone, You know what, too? I want to talk about being authentic. And you're like, Do any of you have to say it's authentic? It's not. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around.
