[00:00:08.490] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammatin.

[00:00:22.290] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you for having me do this. I'm a huge admirer of yours.

[00:00:26.880] - Speaker 1
Thank you so much.

[00:00:27.600] - Speaker 2
I really appreciate it. I was very honored by getting your call.

[00:00:31.790] - Speaker 1
I'm a fan from a distance and it's interesting because I'm not a fan of horror movies.

[00:00:36.500] - Speaker 2
Is that right?

[00:00:37.130] - Speaker 1
But no, but I'm interested in outsiders doing something interesting. It's like you fit. What's interesting to me in the world is what you do.

[00:00:49.170] - Speaker 2
That's cool.

[00:00:49.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's not necessarily about the actual content. It's more a way of looking at the world.

[00:00:55.080] - Speaker 2
I'm very flattered by that and I feel the same about you and it's a little different. I'm a fan of all the incredible music that you've put together and I love the 60 minutes, by the way. I just saw that. It was excellent. It was excellent.

[00:01:10.320] - Speaker 1
Thank you.

[00:01:10.780] - Speaker 2
My dream is 60 minutes. Wow. I pitch them constantly.

[00:01:14.700] - Speaker 1
Really?

[00:01:15.080] - Speaker 2
They're so tired of hearing. I can't get on.

[00:01:17.150] - Speaker 1
I'm just trying so hard. There'll be a time. No, there'll be a time you'll do something really bad, really terrible, and that'll spark it.

[00:01:28.050] - Speaker 2
I feel like 60 minutes, that might actually really impress my parents. They don't like horror movies either, but that would really solve a lot of inner problems.

[00:01:39.710] - Speaker 1
Let's talk about that. How do your parents feel about the movies?

[00:01:43.800] - Speaker 2
Oh, my parents definitely don't like horror movies, but I think they're both very proud of what I've built and what I've achieved. But they don't see very many of our movies. I took my dad, we premiered the normal heart in New York, which is a movie I made for HBO with Ryan Murphy. And he went to the premiere of that. I thought that was really going to solve that problem. But he didn't really like the normal heart either. Although I'm sure they liked whiplash. They both like Whiplash.

[00:02:12.880] - Speaker 1
Whiplash.

[00:02:13.490] - Speaker 2
Black Klansman. They like black Klansmen. They like Blumhouse classics.

[00:02:20.750] - Speaker 1
How did you find yourself in this niche? Was it intentional or it just revealed itself as you were working?

[00:02:27.550] - Speaker 2
It was definitely 100% both. I loved independent movies in the 90s. That's what I kind of grew up with is independent movies. And I left to become an independent producer probably a little. I probably should have stayed in the system a little bit longer than I did. Anyway, I left to start producing movies on my own in 2000 and I made a handful of independent movies which were fun to make, but nobody saw them. And I was very frustrated by the fact that no one was seeing our little independent movies. And I really, really wanted to make a studio movie, mostly for the distribution, not necessarily for what studio movies are like, to have 500 people work on the distribution of my movie. And so the first one, really, the only one I ever made a traditional studio movie was the tooth Fairy with Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

[00:03:16.340] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:03:16.980] - Speaker 2
Which I made for Fox. And I was, I guess, in my early to mid thirty s. And it was disappointing. It was nothing, kind of, I hoped it would be. The production of it was very decision by committee. The more money you spend for me, the less interesting the process is. And I've never, ever not had that experience on movies. But that was the good example of it. But the Tooth Fairy was released almost exactly the same time as paranormal activity was released. The distribution of the tooth fairy, I was blown away. I was like, this is everything I hope for and dream for. I want to make movies that go through this system. I want the studio system. I don't want to beg this person to draw the poster and call the movie theater that doesn't want the movie and beg people to go see the movie. Like, I want ads on the basketball game for my movies. So the tooth Fairy happened, and right after the tooth fairy, right before, right around the same time, paranormal activity came out. And the amazing thing with paranormal activity was I got to have my cake and eat it, too, because it was a totally independent movie made for no money, distributed by a studio.

[00:04:25.750] - Speaker 1
How did it get distributed by the studio? How did the. Tell me the story.

[00:04:29.220] - Speaker 2
The story of paranormal?

[00:04:30.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:04:31.990] - Speaker 2
Wow. I haven't told this story in a long time.

[00:04:34.840] - Speaker 1
Good.

[00:04:35.240] - Speaker 2
Do you want. The longer you want me to try and long you want the long, I.

[00:04:38.440] - Speaker 1
Want to hear everything. I like detail.

[00:04:40.640] - Speaker 2
You like detail? Okay, well, I'll give you detail. Well, like I said, I left an executive job in 2000 and I produced a bunch of independent movies. And it's another story. But I got what I thought I always wanted, which was a first look at a studio. I had a golf cart. I had fancy offices. The dream had come true. In fact, I learned, in fact, and we don't have offices on a lot anymore either. And it's the last thing that I wanted, but I had to get it to learn that I didn't want it.

[00:05:14.370] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:05:15.120] - Speaker 2
And I was working at Paramount, and Gail Berman and Brad Gray, who's no longer with us, had kind of made my deal. And then the administration there inherited my deal. And they were like, why are you paying this guy so much money? And this guy's never produced a movie before that anyone's ever seen. And this is stupid. So I couldn't get anything done at Paramount. I was lucky enough to have spending, but they were spending a lot overhead. It was just a mess, and it was very frustrating. Anyway, there was a younger producer named Steven Schneider who they put me with, who was a horror expert. I was not a horror expert. I had certainly become one, but I was not like Quentin or Eli Roth or like, growing up with horror. I grew up with Halloween and being very weird and having a lot in common with fans of horror, but I wasn't like a horror nut movie.

[00:06:07.390] - Speaker 1
What were the movies that you watched as a kid? Like, what were your favorite movies?

[00:06:10.160] - Speaker 2
I loved Hitchcock movies, but I loved academy movies. I loved art house movies, bigger art house movies. I love know, I love bigger commercial movies. So anyway, I'm sitting at Paramount very frustrated. This guy, Steven Schneider, who's a horror expert and kind of an academic, he had written books about horror, and he's introducing me to horror, and I'm interested in it, kind of, and we get a dvd of paranormal activity as a directing sample. And we got it from CAA, but finished film, wow. I had nothing to do with the finished film. My favorite way to produce a movie is when the movie is already finished.

[00:06:51.480] - Speaker 1
How great is.

[00:06:52.100] - Speaker 2
It's the best ever.

[00:06:53.060] - Speaker 1
No fantasy there.

[00:06:55.430] - Speaker 2
It's right there. It's right there. It's right there. So I got this. You don't know any of the. So I got the movie finished, and the person at CAA wasn't representing the movie because they didn't believe in the movie. But there was someone at CAa, a guy named Brian Cavanaugh Jones, who's no longer there. And he was like, this movie is kind of cool. I'm going to try and sell it or do something with it. And we got it, the pretense with which it was sent to us as a directing sample. So, like, here's the movie. This movie is out, coming out already, but do you want to make this guy's next movie? And I saw the movie, and I was like, this movie is really good and really commercial. What are you doing with it? They were negotiating a deal with IFC to sell it for like 100 grand or 150 grand for a direct to video at the time, a direct to dvd movie before streaming. And I, ten years before that, had the wherewithal to pass on the Blair witch project. And that was a big mistake, and it was ingrained. I really learned from, like you do.

[00:08:01.550] - Speaker 2
You learn from your mistakes? And I was like, if that ever happens to me again, if the gods ever happen, I'm not going to fuck this up a second time. And it did. Ten years later, I got like, what I thought, and the first thing I thought when I saw the movie is Blair witch.

[00:08:16.090] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:08:16.480] - Speaker 2
Everyone thinks it's nothing. It's made for nothing, and it's a joke, and it could be something amazing. Could be, yes. I didn't know for a fact. You never know.

[00:08:26.440] - Speaker 1
You never know.

[00:08:27.220] - Speaker 2
You never know. But you have a. Yeah, yeah.

[00:08:29.540] - Speaker 1
You felt it.

[00:08:30.290] - Speaker 2
I felt a hunch.

[00:08:31.020] - Speaker 1
I felt it enough to want to pursue it, which is exactly the key.

[00:08:34.420] - Speaker 2
Exactly. So I felt it enough to say, I want to meet the director, writer director guys named Oren Pelley. He was a video game designer, and that's kind of why he was able to make the movie work, is he did a lot of stuff from video game, if you think about it, has a lot of kind of dna of a video game. Anyway, I meet Oren at my old held house in the hills in West Hollywood on a Sunday, and I said to him, I told him the story, and I said, I've seen your movie, and I don't want it to happen again. And I think it could be a big theatrical hit, and I'm willing to only get paid. I remember I said, if you make. He had 150 grand, I think, or 150 grand. I said, I don't want to get paid unless you make over $400,000. But if you make over 400 grand, I get x piece forever. And I'm going to try. And he said, well, everyone's seen it. Everyone's passed on it. It's just the ship has sailed. I said, you never know and you.

[00:09:33.300] - Speaker 1
Got nothing to lose.

[00:09:33.980] - Speaker 2
I got nothing to lose. Yeah. Well, here was one. You always have to be lucky, too, right? So one thing I was so lucky is he wasn't a kid. Had he been 22, he would have said, I made the movie for 15 grand. I got $150,000. I'm taking my money. But luckily, he was also in his mid 30s. He was making six figures already, so it wasn't going to change his life forever. So he had the liberty to say, okay, I'll cancel this deal and give this weird plum guy a shot. So I was very lucky about that. So we did an agreement, and I said, when I was an executive, I did acquisition. So really I bought and sold, finished films. So this was a muscle that I was very used to using. And I'd been out on my own for about four or five years as a producer, no longer an acquisitions executive. I was very careful with the relationships that I had. I went all around the world with a group of people who did this very weird job. They bought movies for film companies and we all knew each other. There were 20 of us.

[00:10:32.490] - Speaker 2
I'm sure it's still the same today, maybe there are a few more, but it's the same idea. It's a weird job in our ecosystem. And anyway, it had been years since I'd seen these people and I called them individually up and I said, guys, I think I have the next Blair witch. This is a paranormal activity. Oh, we already saw it, guys. We all saw Blair Witch, too. I had the DVD of Blair Witch before VHS of Blair Witch before Sunday. I watched it on VHS. We all passed. I couldn't just spend $20,000 or $30,000 on a test screen. If it would happen today, I would have sent a test screening and I couldn't. So I was actually just saying, why don't you guys just test it? Like spend 2030 grand, test it? I couldn't get anyone to do that. So I thought of festival. So we applied to Sundance, they turned it down. So then we applied to slam dance and they accepted the movie, which is never as good because everyone knows when you're in slam dance you've been turned down by Sundance. But it was some platform, right then I had Anne Thompson and John Horn.

[00:11:33.800] - Speaker 2
Anne Thompson for Variety or Hollywood reporter, and John Horn wrote an amazing LA Times piece. He loved the movie and she loved the movie. And they got the movie.

[00:11:42.740] - Speaker 1
Nice.

[00:11:43.310] - Speaker 2
And I got a big piece of press, two big pieces of press, like really substantial. And I called all the acquisition people again. I said, I know you guys have the DVD. I know you guys. Or the VHS, no dvd. I know you guys have seen it. Come to the screening. Look what John Horn wrote. Look what. And it was a Sunday. Pictures, like big, look what Anne Thompson wrote. Come to this screening. And they all said they would come and then they didn't really, they sent their like the junior most junior most junior person. And slam dance ends. And I'll remember this for the rest of my life, I'm sure, because it's been 20 years already and I'm sitting at lunch with Oren and I'm kind of like, well, I mean, I guess you're going to take this IfC deal. I got no choice. Except there's one last Hail Mary, which I don't think I'd even really told him before because I was so sure I wasn't going to do this. Paramount was treating me like shit, but I was guilty because they were paying me so much money. And this was at the time when Paramount owned DreamWorks.

[00:12:42.590] - Speaker 2
So I thought, if I can't get anything done with Paramount, I'm going to try and get something done with DreamWorks, because I'm the kind of person, and I'm sure you're the same, when I get money from a big company, I want everyone to make money. Right. That's how you become successful.

[00:12:55.260] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[00:12:55.700] - Speaker 2
So when someone invested, it was $5 million over three years. I'm like, I was so dead set on, probably in an unhealthy way, making that money back for them. And I'm like, if they're not going to take my calls, I'm going to make DreamWorks make this money.

[00:13:10.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:13:11.850] - Speaker 2
So there was an executive at DreamWorks too, one named Ashley Brooks and another named Adam Goodman. And they saw paranormal activity right around this time, right before the festival, whatever. They said, look, the movie's kind of weird, but we'll remake the movie. And I said, well, I had two thoughts here. This was one of the smartest things I've probably done in my career. I said to them, I need at least 250 for Oren because I need it to make more sense. I knew that idea of a remake would drive him insane, but I said, give me 250 so he gets more money. And I wrote this in the contract. I said, before you remake it, you need to test screen the film. And I framed it to them to say, you guys are the geniuses. I don't know what I'm doing. Test screen paranormal activity only so we can decide what to keep and what to throw out when we remake the film, right? Only to decide what we keep in throw. And I haven't told the story so long, it's really actually fun to tell. And I said, have your writer there. Your writer.

[00:14:14.100] - Speaker 2
So that we decide then. Now I'm back to Oren at the end of slam dance. I said, look, this is the only thing I have. But I said, oren. Now. I had the insight of having watched the movie a bunch of times with crowds. Now I'm much more confident the movie's going to work. I said to Oren, if we get a decision maker in a room with a random audience, there's no way they're going to remake the movie. It's the dumbest idea in the world. You don't remake the found footage movie with movie stars. Like, it's so dumb. I said, but we're going to have to pretend that we want to remake it. We're going to sign this deal. Worst case scenario, the movie, you're going to get 250 grand. The movie is going to come out anyway. Tiny anyway, so what do you care? But I said, I promise. And I was just lucky also that he took the leap of faith with me again. And I said, I promise you, if we get into this movie theater, they're going to put the movie on 3000 screens. I said, I promise. And he agreed.

[00:15:10.070] - Speaker 2
And we signed that deal with Dreamworks. And right around this time, Spielberg saw the movie.

[00:15:15.530] - Speaker 1
He felt you weren't. What it was was you were telling him what you really felt. And he felt, yeah, he believed in the movie too. You were saying, I believe in the movie.

[00:15:26.770] - Speaker 2
And he believed in the movie.

[00:15:27.770] - Speaker 1
He believed in the movie. He's like, we have to play this game because these people don't understand. But let's show them.

[00:15:33.920] - Speaker 2
But let's show them. Let's show. And Oren and I had a lot of disagreements over the years, but I'm obviously fond of this movie. Started my whole company, started my career, everything I owe everything that I have to this movie and to Oren. So we have a test in Burbank. It's like two or three months later. It's like in the spring because Sundance is in January, it's March, April, like this time of year. 300 people. Adam Goodman, Stacey Snyder, Ashley. Some writer directors to work on the sequel, right? And we sit down and it's the first blind recruit. I've seen the movie with an audience, but never a blind recruit. So it's just blind people are like.

[00:16:10.010] - Speaker 1
How many people in the room would.

[00:16:11.020] - Speaker 2
Two. 5300. 299, I think. 299.

[00:16:13.830] - Speaker 1
So crowded theater.

[00:16:14.990] - Speaker 2
Every seat full.

[00:16:15.820] - Speaker 1
Great.

[00:16:16.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah, every sea full. Every seat full. And we screen the movie, I'm sitting next to Oren and people go fucking berserk. It's amazing. And the movie ends. And we walk down to talk to the executives. The word remake is never uttered. It's never uttered again, but it's never uttered. And Stacey Snyder again, to this day I will remember, is pitching what the tv spots for the wide release are going to be for the amazing. It's amazing. Spielberg sees it the next day because he hears that DreamWorks owns this movie, the tested. So great. He's like very enthusiastic. And then this is only in the movie business. And we're good to go. Like, it's a wide release. We're going through Paramount because Dreamworks owns Paramount. But DreamWorks is doing all the marketing and I'm like, I'm going to make Paramount their money again. Plus I'm going to make money. And this is amazing.

[00:17:09.820] - Speaker 1
Win win. Everybody wins.

[00:17:11.350] - Speaker 2
Everybody wins.

[00:17:12.160] - Speaker 1
And the audience gets to see a great movie.

[00:17:13.840] - Speaker 2
And the audience gets to see the great movie best. Everybody wins best. Until you want to keep going. Because it keeps going.

[00:17:19.290] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[00:17:19.660] - Speaker 2
Yes. In August of this same year, Dreamworks and Paramount break up and Dreamworks goes to Disney, and Paramount does Paramount, and they have a divorce. And they give up projects like children. And clearly the great paranormal activity is not going to go to Disney. So paranormal activity goes to Paramount. And it started over from zero. So Paramount got the movie. They were not at the test screening. They don't care about any of that stuff. They think the movie's a piece of garbage like anything else. And the only savior is that shortly thereafter, Adam Goodman, who was at Dreamworks, got hired at Paramount. And so Adam Goodman fought internally at Paramount. And I fought externally for 18 months. But I will tell you the ultimate deal that we, paramount, if you remember, it wasn't a wide release. They released it in 20 markets and then it took off. And then they spent money. So what Paramount agreed to do is give us a million dollars, of which we put up 500 grand. They came back to us, renegotiated. They said, we're not doing this deal. We're not going to release your movie unless you. But they basically, like, blackmailed us and totally didn't believe in the movie.

[00:18:32.430] - Speaker 2
And then it got released for a million dollars on 20 screens. There was a woman named Amy Powell who really did a lot of the marketing for the movie, and she was great. And Adam believed in it. Nobody else did. And then the movie took off and the rest is history. But the second half of the story was as bleak as the first. Oren, just to give you a detail, Oren was living. He was living in my guest house for like six weeks after the dreamworks thing. But we did it. We did it. Amazing story.

[00:19:02.720] - Speaker 1
Amazing. Yeah. That would definitely make you not want an office on the lot.

[00:19:11.070] - Speaker 2
The amazing thing is we did paranormal one, then we've done six paranormals. We did paranormal two, and they still kicked me off a lot. I still have such tortured feelings about Paramount, though. No one is there anymore who was there at the time. But anyway, to go back to your first question, just to answer briefly, because there's a very specific answer to it. What the paranormal activity in tooth fairy did was, and the reason that I love horror movies, it's not what one would think is it showed me that horror is the only genre that you can make the movies totally independently and release the movies by a traditional studio. And you can't really do that with any other genre.

[00:19:50.980] - Speaker 1
True. It doesn't work with any other genre.

[00:19:53.790] - Speaker 2
It's got to be cheap. So horror is very cheap. Horror is not star dependent.

[00:19:59.430] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:19:59.900] - Speaker 2
The closest cousin to horror is comedy for sure, but comedy, you can't do cheap comedies that are wide releases. You can make cheap comedies on tv, streaming indie stars. You need big stars. And with big stars, big money. Really. The way I still look at my movie is it's like we're this Trojan horse of indie movies. We're like taking these subversive about it. Me too.

[00:20:21.100] - Speaker 1
That's what I love about it.

[00:20:21.940] - Speaker 2
And we take subversive, indie crazy, screwed up stories.

[00:20:26.670] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:20:27.080] - Speaker 2
And you get big public companies to spend 40 or $50 million releasing that. And that is the true joy. And it's still, after 25 years, it's still, as you could see by the smile on my face, I get such a kick out of it. Like people say, like, oh, we want the next. Get out. It's like, over my dead body would you have done. Get out. No one would ever make, get out. No one would barely release. Get out. They wouldn't touch. And the only reason we're able to is not because I'm a genius, but because I'm a pretty psycho about costs and I'm psycho about costs not to make a lot of money. I could make a lot of money doing a lot of things. I'm psycho about costs because that allows.

[00:21:03.660] - Speaker 1
Us to take risks and make crazy movies.

[00:21:06.670] - Speaker 2
Crazy movies.

[00:21:07.550] - Speaker 1
The best.

[00:21:08.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's really the best. Really fun.

[00:21:10.660] - Speaker 1
This is interesting, hearing the story about paranormal activity. Is it possible that the way it got released on the 20 screens first actually, was that vintage as opposed to going wide out of the box?

[00:21:24.000] - Speaker 2
It definitely was.

[00:21:25.850] - Speaker 1
It worked out good.

[00:21:27.020] - Speaker 2
It worked out great. And it wasn't a deliberate choice. It was a choice based solely because of money. Yes, but it turned out it was great. It made the movie a word of mouth sensation and it built, it was the perfect release for the movie.

[00:21:41.060] - Speaker 1
So that's one of the interesting things about perceived limitations.

[00:21:44.890] - Speaker 2
Totally.

[00:21:45.670] - Speaker 1
It's like you're doing low budget movies. That's a perceived limitation. Or you have to innovate.

[00:21:51.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you have to innovate.

[00:21:52.430] - Speaker 1
You want 3000 screens, you get 20,000. But then there's a lot of people who want to see that movie based on the word of mouth and they can't see it. And that makes it that much more forbidden and desirable.

[00:22:03.650] - Speaker 2
Totally. I mean, I'm sure you're the same, but I'm a huge believer that if you reduce capital, more creative, better decisions made always.

[00:22:13.370] - Speaker 1
We see so many projects that just have money thrown at them and all it is is like, it's all decoration. There's no substance underneath. Because the ideas are not expensive. The breakthrough ideas are not expensive. It's the way of looking at the world by crazy people like us.

[00:22:33.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly.

[00:22:35.140] - Speaker 1
That finds a way to make this crazy thing that people haven't experienced before. That's what's exciting.

[00:22:40.630] - Speaker 2
That's what's exciting. And speaking of things that haven't experienced before, I think the reason why it's so rare that streaming movies break out into the culture and have a cultural impact is one, money, they're too expensive, but two. Exactly. To your point, if you use data and research and analytics, it's good for some things. But if you're using that to choose art, you're never going to get art. That's all your choices. Could you imagine?

[00:23:11.790] - Speaker 1
It's all the same.

[00:23:13.630] - Speaker 2
I'm going to analyze over the last ten years the artists that have sold at Larry's, and then I'm going to generate this to sell.

[00:23:21.570] - Speaker 1
It's ridiculous.

[00:23:22.430] - Speaker 2
It's ridiculous.

[00:23:24.610] - Speaker 1
The whole key to art is the point of view of the artist. And AI doesn't have a point.

[00:23:30.850] - Speaker 2
And then it's new, it's not based on, I mean, you always see musicians, painters, artists, they're always looking at the history of whatever they're doing and borrowing for sure. But when you get something really reinventing or innovating, it doesn't relate to something else. It's different.

[00:23:52.410] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the world of acquisition. So you lived in that world, and it sounds like a fascinating. What are the kind of films that you saw? What's that life like?

[00:24:01.710] - Speaker 2
It was amazing.

[00:24:03.710] - Speaker 1
How many films are there?

[00:24:05.120] - Speaker 2
Well, I'm 54, so I graduated college in 1991. I sold cable tv door to door, and then I was a real estate agent in New York. And real estate agent especially was great trading for what we do. And I got a job. My first job was a company called Aero Entertainment. And Aero Entertainment was run by a guy who had a commercial real estate company down this hallway and a movie company down the other hallway, and he released independent movies and my roommate in college was Noah Baumbach, who's a writer director. And he had written this script called kicking and screaming. It was called fifth year. And this guy, Dennis Friedland, he flirted with making the movie for the summer while I was renting apartments. And at the end of the summer he said, I'm not going to make your movie, but I'll give you a job. You could work full time in the movie business and stop being a real estate agent. So I took him up on it and he gave me the job of acquisitions, which I had no idea what it was. But at that time there were about 1000 or 1500 movies.

[00:25:06.860] - Speaker 2
This is just domestically, not internationally. 1000 movies, maybe 1500 movies a year that were getting made. Almost none of them got distribution. It's such a crazy. 100 would get distribution of some kind. And it was a very fringe business. And I'd go to all the film festivals and it was a tiny company, so we were playing in the. More so I would look at all the movies that the big companies, new line and Fox searchlight and Grammar C and whatever the companies were that passed on. And we would try and buy a movie for like 25 grand or 50 grand. We'd release it in ten cities. We'd spend $100,000 to open the movie in New York and LA and then calendar house, play it a little bit. And then you'd try and sell like 3000 videotapes. And then there was a woman named Doris Cassop who just left HBO. But I would try and sell the HBO, the pay tv rights for like 35 grand. And you try and spend 25 to 50 to buy it, another 150, your total outlay is like 2300 grand. And you try and bring in 500 grand. Most of the time you wouldn't.

[00:26:11.030] - Speaker 1
And one every couple of hundred might break out.

[00:26:15.500] - Speaker 2
One every couple of hundred. Macroly. And for us, we were doing 15 or 20 a year and one or two a year. We had a movie called Bandit Queen with Shaker Kapoor's first movie. We had a movie called my Life's and turnaround. So one or two a year would make like 800 grand or something. It was a very tough business. But then I went to work for Miramax in 1995. There was a woman at Miramax named Amy Israel who did my job for Miramax. And Miramax at that time, they were like AA. That was the dream team. And so I went from this kind of very tiny little thing to a much bigger playing field.

[00:26:49.400] - Speaker 1
How did they find you?

[00:26:50.560] - Speaker 2
Amy was 100% responsible for getting me the job at Miramax we were friends and she would help me. At Arrow was the name of the company. I think I said, she would say, you should look at these ten movies. You should look at these ten movies. And there was a job opening at Miramax and she said, you should interview for it. And I had a 15 minutes interview. I told the story at the interview of how I bought Bandit Queen, actually. And after I told that story, I got the job great. And I worked there for 95 to 2000 and it was massively stressful and I worked unbelievable hours. But it was an incredible experience. And I learned so much paranormal activity. Never would have happened had I not had that experience.

[00:27:33.750] - Speaker 1
Was there ever a case where your inexperience worked to your advantage?

[00:27:41.010] - Speaker 2
I mean, I still think that's true all the time, don't you?

[00:27:44.480] - Speaker 1
I know for me it's all the time.

[00:27:45.670] - Speaker 2
For me it's all the time.

[00:27:47.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because you don't know what's impossible. You don't know what doesn't work.

[00:27:51.820] - Speaker 2
You blindly stumble in. My wife accuses me of that all the time. But I ask a dumb question. I tell my kids every day, I say, daddy makes 1000 mistakes a day. That's like our mantra in our house. And I think that happens all the time. And that definitely happened when I was. The idea that I was 20 years old, I was going to produce no, Boundback's movie, my other 20 year old friends. Like his first movie. It was insane. Totally insane.

[00:28:18.440] - Speaker 1
But why not? It's like the other side of it is, why not?

[00:28:20.670] - Speaker 2
And we got it done somehow. I mean, I didn't get the credit I should have gotten and I lost money. But it happened.

[00:28:27.520] - Speaker 1
It happened.

[00:28:28.100] - Speaker 2
It happened. Yeah.

[00:28:32.450] - Speaker 1
How would you describe how does the mainstream model of filmmaking work versus what you do? I honestly don't know how the mainstream works either. So describe both.

[00:28:44.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah, sure. Well, we're totally opposite. And the unusual thing about the company is that usually if you're totally opposite you wouldn't be in the mainstream movies. You wouldn't be working with the studios. You'd be working independent distributor independent. So our approach to making movies is totally, totally opposite to mainstream. But our distribution is the same, which is kind of cool. Mainstream Hollywood, you'll be surprised to hear, is still just absolutely addicted to money. And I mostly fault the representatives for that. For a lawyer, an agent, a manager, no matter. You would be shocked the amount of money we've made for people working in our system on back end. And I'll talk to agents who've represented seven people or managers or lawyers or whatever, eight people who've benefited from that, and they will say to me, well, the director already did a $10 million movie, so the next movie, I want, the director do. We're looking for a $30 to $50 million movie. Now, it's hard to impress upon you, in my opinion, how backwards that thinking is. Like the idea that it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what it is. You should do the script that you love, of course.

[00:30:02.750] - Speaker 2
And unless you're one of 20 people, your voice will be less heard directly correlates to how much you spend. So you have a director who's done a great Sundance movie, and then they're thrown into a Marvel movie. They're not really direct. I mean, they're kind of directing the Marvel movie, but Marvel's directing that movie and the foundation of the studio system. Not the studio's fault. Not the studio's fault. It's all the representatives made it. All the people's fault. Telling their artists, you're ready for a more expensive movie. And that's for a very simple reason, which is that when you're working at one of those companies, unfortunately, even if they're not public, they're based on annual bonuses. So if you say to an agent over five years, you're going to make $10 million, or we'll pay you three and a half million dollars this year, the agent will always choose three and a half instead of ten, because he or she doesn't even know if they're going to be at the agency. That client might have left a million. Things could have happened.

[00:31:03.430] - Speaker 1
So everyone's playing a short term game.

[00:31:05.640] - Speaker 2
Everyone is playing a short term, pay me upfront game. Not everyone, but if you ask, kind of fundamentally, the difference between our business and our business is a long term work for a little bit of money up front. If it works, you'll make way more than you'll make three times what you would have made up.

[00:31:27.370] - Speaker 1
A more personal, honest. It'll be your movie.

[00:31:30.800] - Speaker 2
It'll be your movie and you'll get a more. And the experience is so much better. And it applies to us, too. If I'm talking to, normally, my partner on all these movies is universal. If I'm talking to Universal and they paid me a $4 million fee before the movie's released, and you of all people will appreciate this, it feels like not ethical to then tell them how I want the creatively, the movie. I think it should be this actor. I think it should be this.

[00:31:58.850] - Speaker 1
They bought it.

[00:31:59.500] - Speaker 2
It's like they bought it. And by the way, I'm getting paid already and they're 100 million in the hole. So the conversation is so fraught and it's not equal and it's not fun and it's like, it feels yucky to me. Whereas instead of paying 100, you're paying $15 million for the movie or $10 million for the movie. I haven't gotten anything unless the movie works. That creative conversation about what we're doing together is so much more fruitful. I have so much more ground to stand on because it's like I got skin in the game, too. And that is fundamentally on the movie business side. That's the big difference between what we do and what studios do. And the sad thing about just the entertainment business in a whole is that model is being. I shouldn't even say it's being challenged in television. It's been decimated. There's no such thing as ownership left in tv. In movies, there really is. But in tv, the idea of owning an equity and show, it's been decimated by streaming. I don't know if you saw, I wrote an op ed about it in the times a year ago, but I think that's a really bad thing for our business as a whole.

[00:33:02.490] - Speaker 1
How did your relationship with Universal start?

[00:33:05.640] - Speaker 2
This is a good story, too. I did paranormal activity. I did two paranormal activities. Paramount kicked me off the lot because they were going through. You could tell. I have such a chip on my shoulder about Paramount. I just read the book, by the way.

[00:33:15.650] - Speaker 1
I love that they kicked you off the.

[00:33:17.070] - Speaker 2
Kicked me off the lot. I love it. Did me a huge favor.

[00:33:19.410] - Speaker 1
Great.

[00:33:19.780] - Speaker 2
Huge favor. Helped build my business. Terrific. There's a manager who's still in the business named Ellen Goldsmith Bain, who has a company called Gotham who I haven't seen in many years, but she was kind enough to let me camp out in offices, in her office there on sunset. I took a little. The three people left at my company. We all went there. And the reason that Paramount kicked me off a lot was the reason that I couldn't really get my next thing going is because they had so little success at Paramount that everyone at the company wanted the success to own paranormal activities so badly that they wanted to erase the producers and the wanted. They wanted us to go away so that they could own every bit of it, which is amazing. And anyway, Donna Langley and Brian Lord were at a lunch like a year after something like that. And Donna said, there's this horror tradition at Paramount. Like, I really want to get that going again. And Brian said, have you met Jason Blum? And that was how my. And she said, no, I have no idea who that is. And I went in, I pitched her my thing.

[00:34:18.690] - Speaker 1
Has Brian been your agent the whole time?

[00:34:20.310] - Speaker 2
He's been my agent. I met Brian in 1993.

[00:34:23.330] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:34:24.160] - Speaker 2
I was producing again during my real estate agent days. I also produced theater. I had a company called the Malipart Theater Company, and Ethan Hawke was my partner in it. So Brian represented Ethan in the early ninety s, and he would come to the shows, and I was the producer of these theater shows. And I was, like, running around, making sure Brian had a good seat. And that's how we met. And he's always been my mentor and helper, and he's been absolutely instrumental in structuring and growing Blumhouse, like, in an incredible, incredible way. He's been an incredible partner to us. So we do the deal with Universal, and oftentimes people talk about, like, why don't studios just copy your model? They can't. They're just not built to make low budget. They just can't. And they can do every. So once every four years it happens, but they can't do it five times a year like we do, because it's two different businesses. Like you said, we're just in different businesses. Anyway, I pitched my whole thing. The first movie we made was the purge. It was a two and a half million dollar movie. And it was so funny, all the budget, the conversations, and Jimmy Horowitz, who was a senior business person at Universal, the senior business person at Universal, and he's been there forever.

[00:35:37.920] - Speaker 2
And he was very instrumental in putting together a deal that I could do with Universal so I could do my thing. And I give him a lot of credit, him and Donna. A lot of credit. They really did a thing where it's like, here's $3 million. Come back with a finished movie. Because anything other than that, which doesn't.

[00:35:53.800] - Speaker 1
Work, it would undermine the whole thing. The red tape of the system.

[00:35:57.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it would not work. Would not work. And I remember we made the movie, we test screened the movie. That wonderful distribution executive, Nikki Rocco, who was a great kind of famous, she was there. And they all came to this screening. They just couldn't understand, like a two and a half million. How are we going to release it? And it was, luckily, it was a big success for everybody. And that kicked off the business at Universal.

[00:36:19.600] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the test screenings in general. Is it good? Is it bad?

[00:36:26.250] - Speaker 2
I love them.

[00:36:27.100] - Speaker 1
Tell me about everything about.

[00:36:28.810] - Speaker 2
I love a test screening. When a director says, I had a friends and family screening, da da da. I stop listening as soon as they say friends and family, it's your friends and family. I like. Very, very early on, it's good to show friends and family, but then when you're ready, I love a test screening because you get just moviegoers and the best test screenings are out of town. We try and do a lot of ours out of town. Not most, but we try and do a lot of them in Oklahoma or Arizona or even in northern California because this area is so overtested. Anywhere within 50 miles of LA is having a test screening almost every day. So it's just over screened and the audience is kind of cynical. You get like the film students who are in, they say the end of the first act is slow. You're like, oh, my God, I can't believe this is the best. And I think the scores and the comments are helpful, but not that I think is take it or leave it. Some of our most successful movies have had bad scores and we've had some great scoring movies that have not done well at all.

[00:37:28.660] - Speaker 1
So the scores mean less to you?

[00:37:30.830] - Speaker 2
The scores are not that important to me.

[00:37:32.800] - Speaker 1
It's more just the feeling in the room.

[00:37:34.800] - Speaker 2
The feeling in the room you can feel, yeah, you can feel like this paranormal. We didn't test screening until that lasted. But you can feel when you got a movie and you've got the audience. You could totally feel it. And you can feel when the audience is with the movie and you can feel when they're not. And you can feel when the end works and when it doesn't. Many, many of our movies don't have a release date until they're finished. And we test screen our movies a lot.

[00:38:00.040] - Speaker 1
And each time recruit revisions, recruit revision.

[00:38:04.210] - Speaker 2
After reshoots, we'll shoot additional material. Get out. We famously reshot the end of the movie. We had a different plot wise. Like, what happened at the end was totally different in the original movie that.

[00:38:13.640] - Speaker 1
Was based on the test screening, the.

[00:38:15.000] - Speaker 2
Audience, the ending, the end was sad and the audience loved the movie so much. Ultimately, it was up to George. It's not up to me, of course, but we were there with Jordan and the movie ended. Usually I'm a little more diplomatic about it, but with that movie, you could feel it. It was so good. I was like, Jordan, the movie just. The curtain went down. I think Jordan, we got to change the end. We got to have a happy ending. Like Daniel Kaluuya in the original version wasn't a know. I think he wound up in jail and it was just like, it's too dark and he's so good. And you love that character so much. I said, you're cheating the to. By the way, a lot of our movies, I don't always believe you should have a happy ending. But that movie, you had to. So Jordan had a brilliant idea of a scene that we reshot, that he reshot for the end of the movie.

[00:39:02.500] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[00:39:03.580] - Speaker 2
But I love Tess greens. A lot of directors don't, but I love them. We make movies. Not all movies are made for a broad audience, but for me, the magic, like we kind of talked about earlier, is how do I take a subversive story and make it accessible to a super broad audience? And that you can't do that without touch screenings, in my opinion.

[00:39:23.990] - Speaker 1
I believe that. I don't look down on the audience. I think the audience is much more interested.

[00:39:30.310] - Speaker 2
Me too.

[00:39:31.000] - Speaker 1
In something challenging.

[00:39:32.510] - Speaker 2
Yeah, me too.

[00:39:33.240] - Speaker 1
Maybe even hard to understand.

[00:39:34.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah, me too.

[00:39:35.780] - Speaker 1
If it's compelling, that's what they want. They don't want the same old. No, they don't want the same old.

[00:39:41.930] - Speaker 2
They don't want.

[00:39:42.410] - Speaker 1
I don't.

[00:39:43.140] - Speaker 2
But that's what they get.

[00:39:44.300] - Speaker 1
That's what they get.

[00:39:45.440] - Speaker 2
That's why they don't want it. I don't either. None of us do. None of us do. I think it's so funny you talk about the different way. If you just think, here's a different way to think about what we're talking about Visa vis exactly what you just said. If you just think about how a big, expensive movie is greenlit, there's only one way to responsibly do it. And if I was running a studio, which I never will, and I don't have any desire to do that, but I wouldn't change this particular process because it's the only responsible way to do it. The movie costs $150,000,000 and it's whatever. It's an action movie with these two people, you can't get that company to give you the money unless five very bright people, the head of marketing, the head of international, the head of distribution, the head of home entertainment or digital, whatever it's called, come in and say, this movie should play like these four other movies from the past five years. If you have nothing to point back to, to compare it to, it can't get made. It can't even get past a green light.

[00:40:50.500] - Speaker 1
So then it's always going to be the same.

[00:40:52.910] - Speaker 2
Now, when you make a movie for seven or ten or whatever. Our price point is, we get to say the opposite. We get to go in and say, I can't think of a single thing. This is like, let's make it exactly.

[00:41:06.440] - Speaker 1
Which is the best? Which is most.

[00:41:10.390] - Speaker 2
Totally different. Totally different.

[00:41:11.960] - Speaker 1
Now, if you make a movie for seven versus big company making a movie for seven, how would the seven be spent differently?

[00:41:20.490] - Speaker 2
It's more that a big company just can't.

[00:41:24.500] - Speaker 1
They can't make a movie for seven.

[00:41:26.140] - Speaker 2
Make it for seven. It's just too hard to do. There are too many people involved with too many decisions. Because that's what I mean. The apparatus is set up to make it for 80 or 100. So you can't have that apparatus. You have to be free. You can't hold up decisions. The whole approach has to be different when you make low budget movies. So it's not that there is really no, like, Warner Brothers. I don't know. Have they ever made a movie for $7 million? Only when they do a similar version to what? I don't know what Magic Mike was, but they give the director or the producer the money. They say, come back with the movie, but they can't be an active producer on low budget movies like that. Any studio.

[00:42:05.260] - Speaker 1
How many people are at Blumhouse?

[00:42:07.740] - Speaker 2
We have, like 85 people.

[00:42:09.800] - Speaker 1
That's a lot.

[00:42:10.340] - Speaker 2
That's a lot.

[00:42:11.340] - Speaker 1
And tell me, what do they do?

[00:42:12.560] - Speaker 2
35 are in tv, 35 are in movies, and 20 do both.

[00:42:17.790] - Speaker 1
And are many of them producers? Like, what would be the job titles range?

[00:42:22.990] - Speaker 2
Job titles was. So there's a creative group for both, which would be like Purdue creative executives for tv. So there are about ten creative executives, maybe five for each group, a little bit more for tv. But then we have. Because we're running the movies, we're acting like a financier, even though sometimes it's our money, but it's usually not our money. So we have to have business affairs, we have to have lawyers, we have to have a CFO, we have accounting, we have marketing, communications.

[00:42:49.720] - Speaker 1
So whether it's your money or not, post production, we run the whole thing.

[00:42:53.270] - Speaker 2
And if we go over budget, we're on the hook, because you can't ask for someone to give you the money and then say, whoops. So if you're going to be a grown up, you got to be a grown up. You got to take it good with the bad. So when we're running the production, if there's a Covid shutdown, we got to fight insurance or pay for it.

[00:43:12.230] - Speaker 1
How do you decide. Do you decide when a project comes in, it's more right for a movie? It's more right for tv. Or is that already always assumed beforehand?

[00:43:22.430] - Speaker 2
It's not assumed. If it's like a book or an article or a remake. Sometimes that could be a series too.

[00:43:28.940] - Speaker 1
And how often do those things happen, those examples you just gave?

[00:43:32.500] - Speaker 2
Like us optioning a book, we option ten or 15 books or maybe ten books or articles a year. Not that much. We don't.

[00:43:41.380] - Speaker 1
How many of those end up getting made?

[00:43:43.250] - Speaker 2
80%. I mean, we make.

[00:43:44.680] - Speaker 1
You make a lot.

[00:43:45.540] - Speaker 2
We have very little development that we don't. We have more in tv because our tv company focused, like more traditional company. The tv company, really? What I. In my head, I think about the tv company as using the brand of the movie company to push forward stories that we like in television. But there's no equivalent because there's no back end in tv. You can't make low budget tv. I'll tell you something crazy. When we budget all the platforms, if anyone's listening, they'll humble and mumble. But everyone does this. When we budget a movie, we make it as low as we possibly can because we get profit. When you budget the tv show, anyone who budgets a tv show, you do the opposite. When they say, what's the budget of the show? You say, make it as expensive as it can possibly be because you're paid as a percentage of how much it.

[00:44:32.070] - Speaker 1
Cost, which makes no sense for anyone.

[00:44:36.070] - Speaker 2
For anyone. For us, for the people, it makes no sense. But there's no version of sharing in television, so there's no incentive to make low budget television. So we can't take our model of how we make movies and apply it to tv. We can only take the brand, Blumhouse, and apply that to the things that we're making in tv.

[00:44:53.680] - Speaker 1
This is a little bit. We talked about this a little bit, but where would you say the money is wasted in major movies? The way normal movies made?

[00:45:01.420] - Speaker 2
Sure, the biggest waste of the money is, like we were talking about before, is the upfront payments to producers, to directors, to writers. We all should have equity in what we're doing, I think not everything, but most things.

[00:45:15.780] - Speaker 1
And there's less incentive for it to perform. Of course there's no incentive.

[00:45:19.880] - Speaker 2
There's no incentive. You're not alive. No, it's a very specific incentive. The director, in a traditional movie, the director's been paid. The director is at a test screening. The director is thinking about one thing. Whether they admit it or not, critics and critics and audiences are not in sync. The studio is thinking about one thing too. Audiences. The director's been paid, the director's made their thing, the director's next gig. Does it depend on the box office? Of course they can't make it really. But it depends just as much, if not more, on the critical reviews. If the movie is 100% or 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, even if it doesn't do that well, that directors, everyone wants to, every actor wants to work with that director. And so you set up, before the movies touched the world, two different agendas between the director and the studio and the financier. Which is funny because every conversation is just, everyone's talking around that. But that's what's going on in every creative. When there's a disagreement between the director and the studio, that's what it's about.

[00:46:21.800] - Speaker 1
Do the critics matter as much today as they did in the past?

[00:46:25.060] - Speaker 2
They don't matter. I don't think they matter that much to the audience, although they still matter. Like if your movie has really been panned, that information gets out quickly, but it does really matter to the other artists. If you have director and everyone hasn't liked your movie, it's going to get hard to get actors to trust you and they still matter.

[00:46:46.480] - Speaker 1
I'm surprised in your paranormal story that that first critical reaction was such an important piece of it. I would have never guessed that even.

[00:46:54.100] - Speaker 2
That, though, wasn't enough. I thought that was going to be like, I'll get the press. That wasn't enough. And then when the movie came out, I think it got pretty good reviews. But reviews are more important than we all like to give people credit for. I always say the critics don't matter when a movie gets bad reviews and when the movies get good reviews, I say the critics are very important.

[00:47:18.310] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It seems to me word of mouth is the key to everything.

[00:47:21.290] - Speaker 2
Word of mouth is so important. It's the most important.

[00:47:23.690] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:47:24.250] - Speaker 2
And especially because word of mouth now takes 5 seconds.

[00:47:27.530] - Speaker 1
What do you think it is about the horror genre? Why do we like horror movies? I don't. But why do other people like horror?

[00:47:34.150] - Speaker 2
I get it. I think the biggest reason, there's been a million answers to that question. They've all been said a million times, but this has been said before. But to me, what resonates the most is that the idea of seeing people or seeing threatening situations that are totally within your control.

[00:47:50.450] - Speaker 1
So you get to experience. You get to experience the scary situation from the safety of your theater seat.

[00:47:56.360] - Speaker 2
Exactly. You can turn it off. You can walk into the bathroom. And I think that is really profound for people. I think it really does on some level make people feel the world is safer as a result of it. Their lives are safer. And the normal stuff, getting adrenaline going on a roller coaster, jumping out of a plane, I mean, there's that too. But I think that's really secondary to the world is so threatening and so out of my control. Here's where I could see and experience threats up close and control everything that's really appealing to a big group of people. Not everybody.

[00:48:29.630] - Speaker 1
No, but it's a big group.

[00:48:30.800] - Speaker 2
40% of the population or something.

[00:48:32.700] - Speaker 1
Interesting. It's interesting, yeah. And how would you describe the different subgenres within horror?

[00:48:39.570] - Speaker 2
Well, I'm going to answer your question a different way, okay. Which is there's supernatural and realistic and gory and not gory and science fiction horror and family drama. But there's really funnily two kinds of horror. And when you see more indie horror, and when people don't understand horror, we did a movie called the Bay. Barry Levinson lives on the Chesapeake Bay, and he was rightly concerned about the pollution in the Chesapeake bay. And his agent, John Burnham at the time said, you know, you should do a horror movie about it. He said, good idea. And he wrote this movie called the Bay.

[00:49:17.460] - Speaker 1
It's a great idea.

[00:49:18.560] - Speaker 2
It was good idea. It's a great idea except for the second part. Okay. So John tells him, write a horror movie. He writes a horror movie with the bay. We made it. We made it. The bay. And I use this because Barry was an example of this. And you see this a lot. If you're kind of stepping into horror without understanding it, and it's, for whatever reason, I articulate this and it doesn't land. Horror is just gross. So in other words, horror is just seeing someone with a cut or their foot hanging off or like their ear being cut off. It's just gross. And that, to me, in the case of the bay, it was like these parasites, like eating people. That is not horror. That's like showing gross stuff. Horror is you're watching and you're scared. You're not grossed out. You're not like. You're scared. Now, we have done plenty of movies where there is very violent stuff in them. But a lot of our movies, like Invisible man, for instance, there's very little violence. And a lot of our movies are PG 13. Megan just came out as pg 13. And Megan's a less good example because Megan, there's a lot of humor, which also is an important component to horror, which I could talk about in a second.

[00:50:33.100] - Speaker 2
But what real horror does in my mind is scare the bejesus out of you. And the way that you do that, if you're talking to someone who doesn't really get horror, they either say, isn't this going to be amazing? Like we chop ten heads off in the first movie, right? It's like, no, that's just gross. And the other thing they'll talk about is like if they're talking about a scary movie, like tell me the jump scares. Like what are the scares? Whenever you're on my side of the desk and someone says, what are the scares? You know, that person isn't really a horror fan because the scares in horror Movies are all the same. It's like a bird flies into the window, a door closes on its own, a light goes on. Like the scares aren't what's original. What makes horror movies work is the story in between the scares, the drama in between the scares. Sometimes we have a litmus test in our office when we're deciding to make something. Like if you take out all the set pieces, all the scary stuff, is there like an indie drama that you're on the edge of your seat, the opening of get out, you have this white girl and this black guy and they're dating.

[00:51:39.220] - Speaker 2
You've seen a little bit of their background and then they're in the car, right? And then they're talking and it's like super fraught. Like her parents are kind of racist, but she's kind of not aware of, it's Jordan's writing, it's brilliant. And you like her and you like him, but you're like on the edge of your seat because race, it's being danced around and you're like a deer hits the window. Deer's hit a window in 9 million horror movies. But when that deer hits the window, you jump. You don't jump because the deer hit the wind. You jump because you're so involved and you're pulled in. And a great director of horror knows how to pull you in so that when they scare you, you jump and they don't need to show you something gross you could jump at something tiny.

[00:52:27.210] - Speaker 1
Did Jordan pitch you that movie? How did the movie come?

[00:52:30.890] - Speaker 2
I've talked about it too much this afternoon. I talk about it a lot because it checks every box. It's a four and a half million dollar movie. It was not a movie that would have been ever made by anyone in a million years. The cast was all paid with back end. It really checks every box. That's why I brought it up a lot. Besides the fact that it was one of my favorite movies we ever made. He gave us the script and the script. A lot of people have read the script and no one wanted to make it. Just like I said, it wasn't like some. A lot of the movies that we do are not. We have like this new spec horror movie. There were two or three big specs that have sold in the last eight weeks that we got and didn't bid on. It'll be interesting to see what happens with them. But I don't like chasing. I really don't like chasing. We sometimes do it. If we believe in it and everyone else is chasing, then we do it. But I think usually, more often than not, if you look at the big ip sales, especially with relates to horror, and then the results, there's very little correlation.

[00:53:26.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And you're in the alternative business. If everybody wants it, something's wrong with it. Something's wrong with it.

[00:53:32.690] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:53:33.170] - Speaker 1
Something's wrong with it.

[00:53:34.050] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:53:34.660] - Speaker 1
Too middle of the road.

[00:53:35.700] - Speaker 2
Too middle of the road.

[00:53:36.380] - Speaker 1
Too middle of the road.

[00:53:37.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:53:37.960] - Speaker 1
Where's the line between horror and camp? Because I feel like camp is another piece of horror.

[00:53:43.870] - Speaker 2
Well, comedy is a crucial part of horror. Now, not all of our movies have funny stuff in them, but 90% of them do, and some of them are 50%. If you look at the third paranormal activity movie, it's half jokes and half scares. If you look at happy death day. Happy death day to you. This movie we terrific movie we did called Freaky. Christopher Landon is incredible at it. The insidious movies. Lee Wanell is amazing at understanding and James Wan understanding horror's relationship to comedy, which is very specific, which is simply this, that feeling I described at that scene in get out, you can't keep the audience there. You're pulling the reins too tight. You can keep them there for a few minutes, but an audience isn't going to stay on the edge of their seat. They're not going to stay there. Right. So one of the ways to relax the audience so that they're even more scared is with comedy. So if you're 20 minutes into a horror movie and you have this really funny scene which plays into the tone of the movie and is believable, it can't just be tacked on there.

[00:54:49.700] - Speaker 2
But if people are doing funny stuff, it relaxes the audience. Like, oh, I know these people, it's funny. So when the scare comes, it's much more effective. I see it's also, this is a movie not often associated with horror, but we think about it a lot. And again, it doesn't apply to all of our movies, but most of our 80% to 90% of our horror movies have a lot of fun in them. And I think that really helps is if the movies at times feel fun, if it's just one long dark ride. Now there's one filmmaker that we work with who breaks that rule because I generally think one long, dark ride is not very interesting. Scott Derrickson, who we did sinister with and we did black phone with, we're going to do a sequel to black phone. He's one of the very, very few filmmakers who can mean there's a little stuff with the kids, but there's black phone. If you look at, it's just a serious dark movie, but it's amazing. And it was a big hit. And to bring it back to our conversation earlier, the indie movie that was black phone was Scott had a really tough childhood and it's not an autobiographical by any stretch in terms of actual events, but in terms of his feeling and the feelings of his childhood.

[00:56:14.110] - Speaker 2
Like, black Phone is really like Scott Derrickson's indie version movie of his own childhood, but it's wrapped up in like the scariest movie ever and sinister, which we made ten years ago with him, Ethan Hawke, who, like I said, I produced theater with and is a great old friend of mine. And we've done many projects, we've done ten or twelve movies and tv shows together. And he really did not like horror ever. And he's like, I'm never going to.

[00:56:40.040] - Speaker 1
Do a horror movie.

[00:56:40.580] - Speaker 2
I tried to talk him in, tried to talk him in, and actually he wound up the sinister and the purge. We've done a bunch net black phone, but I got him into it by sinister and it was the first horror movie Ethan ever did. And the way I pitched it to him was I said, look, and he and I share a love of indie movies. And I said, ethan, this movie is so stop thinking about the horror scenes in it. Sinister. The plot of Sinister is a husband and wife, and the husband is a writer. He's a true crime writer, and his career isn't going that well. And he moves his family into a house where this horrible thing took place so he can write his next book about it. But the house is haunted. But he puts his own ambition in front of the safety of his family.

[00:57:20.580] - Speaker 1
Great.

[00:57:20.940] - Speaker 2
It's great. Great. And then Ethan was like, oh, I like that. I like, and Scott. He met with Scott and Scott, and that was how Ethan. We got Ethan into horror. But I went on a tangent there. But Scott can really tell a dark story from beginning to end, and it's so incredibly compelling, but we don't do that very often.

[00:57:37.380] - Speaker 1
Do you pick projects based on the script or based on the filmmaker?

[00:57:42.350] - Speaker 2
I pick projects more based on the filmmaker.

[00:57:46.420] - Speaker 1
The filmmaker. So if you like someone's vision, the script is less of an issue, 100%.

[00:57:52.880] - Speaker 2
And I think we're the only. I don't know if no one would admit that or if we're actually the only place that does that. But that's a big difference between how we choose and how other people choose. Now, my wife would tell you that's because my reading comprehension is terrible, which is probably true. But if I believe in the director's work and I meet the director and I hear him talk about what I just read, yes, get out was a great example. I didn't read that script and be like, this is amazing. In fact, I read the script. I didn't really understand the movie, the script. And I talked to Jordan about that, and I said, there was a scene. I remember on our first meeting, there was the scene where it's all white people at the party, except for a few black people, and they acknowledge each other. The black people acknowledge each other. Like, isn't this wild? We're at this party where there's three of us and a hundred white people. And I remember saying to, is that, do you do, like, does that happen? And Jordan's like, yeah, you do do. Yeah.

[00:58:54.840] - Speaker 2
He's like, when you're at a party and there's two black people, you do acknowledge that. And I remember, based on that and based on the way Jordan spoke about the script, thinking, screw it. Let's do it. And that is the rule, not the exception. Joel Edgerton. We did this movie. It was originally called Weirdo, and then it was called the gift. And I always thought the script was good, but the way Joel talked about it was so compelling. And I much more bet on the movie side of the company, on the filmmaker, on the filmmaker's vision. The funniest story about this is whiplash. We have a great, amazing head of production, and that's another unusual thing about the company, is the senior executives have been with us a long time, and we really have a shorthand with each other. And the person who's run the movie side of the company is a man named Cooper Samuelson, who's my creative partner, and much better reader than me. And when he first started this is a horror movie company, he brings me the script of whiplash, and I'm like, dude, what are you doing? I've read this script.

[01:00:05.050] - Speaker 2
You're not a drummer, I guess. I mean, I have no idea, but it's not a horror movie, so we're not making it. Right? So Cooper was very smart guy, and Cooper knew that Jason Reitman was one of my favorite directors. Ten or 15 years ago, whenever way blush happened, and he kind of quietly gave the script to Jason Reitman and Jason Wright. He got him to read it. Miraculously, he knew a woman who worked for Jason. And Jason said, I'll produce it. And Cooper came kind of bounding into my office and said, do you want to partner with Jason Reitman? I never met Jason Reitman, who was, I just admired him. Yeah, I want to partner with him. He's amazing, of course. And so we did whiplash, and that had everything to do. Talking about people with was the director hadn't done. I don't like, don't know. I don't know. What do you think? Do you think I'm alone in that? Do you think people just don't like to admit that because you want to sound like, oh, I read this. I always wonder, do people want to say, I knew when I read the.

[01:00:58.700] - Speaker 1
Script, I've not read many scripts, because I feel like when I read a script, I have no idea what that movie is. It could be anything.

[01:01:07.510] - Speaker 2
It's so hard.

[01:01:08.640] - Speaker 1
It could be anything.

[01:01:10.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I've been doing it for years, and it's like a blueprint for something.

[01:01:17.570] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Even with music videos, back in the days of music videos, I would always do it based on the person's other work. If the person's other work was great and if they had an idea they felt strongly about, great, let's go.

[01:01:31.260] - Speaker 2
That's what we do. That's what we do.

[01:01:33.120] - Speaker 1
Same.

[01:01:33.500] - Speaker 2
That's what we do.

[01:01:34.190] - Speaker 1
That's interesting.

[01:01:35.930] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think it's hard on people's ego to say that, because I think the ego, there's some pride in, like, I read it and I knew.

[01:01:45.770] - Speaker 1
Really?

[01:01:46.480] - Speaker 2
I think so. Maybe.

[01:01:47.770] - Speaker 1
That's so wild.

[01:01:48.930] - Speaker 2
I think that's why. I think that's why people want to be like, I recognize a great story no matter who wrote it. I think, who cares? It doesn't matter.

[01:01:57.380] - Speaker 1
You don't get any credit for it and for anything. All of the ego based stuff, you don't get credit for any of the ego. All that matters is you make something good, you make something you love. Other people like it win great, everybody wins.

[01:02:09.160] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It doesn't matter how.

[01:02:10.600] - Speaker 1
Doesn't matter how, who did what, doesn't matter.

[01:02:13.020] - Speaker 2
Not at all. But that's such a. Such a. It's such a.

[01:02:17.130] - Speaker 1
Obvious.

[01:02:17.700] - Speaker 2
Seems so obvious. Seems so obvious.

[01:02:20.090] - Speaker 1
Is there ever a topic too hot to touch in a movie too controversial?

[01:02:26.340] - Speaker 2
No, I don't think if you have an inventive director, there is. We did a movie called the Hunt, which goes in my top three kind of biggest regrets, and not in my life, in my professional life, which is inevitable if you produce any amount of anything, which is when you make something that you think is just so great and it doesn't connect. And in this case, this was on the way to connecting. And Trump tweeted about it, so we had to stop the release. It was a huge thing.

[01:02:53.590] - Speaker 1
Tell me the story. I don't know the story at all. Tell me what the film's about.

[01:02:56.840] - Speaker 2
Damon Lindelof and Nick Cruz and Craig Zobel made a movie called the Hunt, which was about liberals shooting red state people for sport. And it was a comment on, it wasn't pro red or pro blue, clearly, it was a comment on the dividedness in America, a very hot topic. It was when Trump was president, and it was the opposite of, like, a Hollywood liberal. It really wasn't that. And it wasn't Yellowstone, either. It was like really trying to comment on just how insane the dialog on both extremes had gotten. That's what it was about. Which, if you started a pitch to me like that right now, I'd say, you can't make a movie like this. But these guys came up with a brilliant, brilliant idea. It was so good. And then what breaks your heart more is sometimes you come up with a great idea and the execution isn't great, but the execution is perfect.

[01:03:58.630] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:03:59.460] - Speaker 2
Perfect. And the movie is testing, and it tests exactly like we wanted to, and the audience is exactly right, and everything is great, and the marketing is perfect. And the movie, we're marching towards the release of the movie, and we have three on the way. A movie is distributed about three months before the theatrical release. The marketing starts to seep into the culture again, totally different than streaming, but on a theatrical movie, three months, two months, and real money starts to get spent. Eight weeks, six weeks, four weeks. Real money, real big money in buying tv spots and all the other stuff. And this is going. Everything is going to go right. It's going to be a hit movie. And my dream kind of hit movie, because not just financial success, but it's going to touch culture in a way that you really hope. And in this case, I'll just call her out. My dear friend Kim Masters wrote a story and hadn't read the script, and the story implied she didn't know what the story of the movie was. And whatever. In her defense, she said she wouldn't responded to, I don't know what the hell happened.

[01:05:06.180] - Speaker 2
Anyway, she wrote a story that didn't represent what the movie was, and somehow that got picked up and picked up and picked up. And Trump tweeted, like, something very derogatory about the hunt being a Hollywood liberal thing, which it was not. But then Trump followers said, we hate Hollywood, and anyone has had anything to do with the hunt, we're going to threaten you. So they threatened me and they threatened Donna, who runs the studio. And it was all based on a misunderstanding. The movie was actually made about this particular thing. And it wasn't a liberal movie at all, but the decision, it looked like the people in the theme parks, the universal theme parks, like, there were bomb scares for the theme parks. And when that happened, it was Universal's decision. And I think it was the right decision because it's only a movie. It's not worth risking people's lives, real lives, and they pulled it off the schedule. And then when a movie comes off a schedule so close to release, it has a taint on it. So then it was rereleased. But when it was rereleased, the marketing for the movie, which applies to everything that we just said, the movie was being marketed as a great scary genre movie about people hunting people.

[01:06:23.100] - Speaker 2
Like, that's how you get people to see it. But then we had to change it to market it like a satire, which is what it really was, but no one wants to go see a satire.

[01:06:32.940] - Speaker 1
I see.

[01:06:33.430] - Speaker 2
So the movie bombed, and it broke my heart. But you asked me if there's any topic that's too hot, and I think it depends on the artist, but I don't think there's any topic too hot, do you? No, I don't think so.

[01:06:46.520] - Speaker 1
No, not at all. I like the idea of the most interesting things are challenging, and if you can find a way to make something challenging that really gets people to think that's what we're here for.

[01:06:57.380] - Speaker 2
Totally. I agree with that.

[01:06:59.070] - Speaker 1
Nothing is black and white. We're dealing in so many shades of gray. It's just interesting to see. Well, I never thought of it like, know. I never thought of it like. Yeah, yeah, I agree that's a wild story.

[01:07:12.210] - Speaker 2
It was an amazing year that year, and the actress was terrific. Her name was Betty Gilpin and she's a great actress. It was going to be a big. Really. I've had a couple of those. I'm sure you've had them too. And it gets so frustrating when you're so close.

[01:07:27.930] - Speaker 1
I love that you're as passionate about it as you are after doing it as long as you have.

[01:07:32.330] - Speaker 2
It's great. I am so passionate about it. I really am.

[01:07:35.280] - Speaker 1
It's a good sign. Yeah, you're doing the right thing. You found the right job.

[01:07:38.880] - Speaker 2
I did definitely find the right job. I'm very grateful for that.

[01:07:41.950] - Speaker 1
Content wise, the difference between tv and movies as it relates to content. Is there a difference? Should there be a difference? What goes where and why?

[01:07:54.900] - Speaker 2
Well, I would tell you that the pandemic and the recent events have totally changed my thinking on this. If you listen to an interview of me from five years ago, I would have said, it doesn't matter. One's 2 hours, one's told over a long period of time. It's the same thing. I now have a totally different point of view because we were all fed tv for so long and the movies were taken away. So of course your point of view changes. I think content wise they are completely different. And I think that a movie is much more dependent on marketing, especially now because most streamers market minimally or not at all. So a movie, you can't do that. You have to have very substantial marketing. So movie, you have to have an idea that can be sold in 15 or 30 seconds. I think that you kind of have to have that, and that's good or bad, but it's just a fact.

[01:08:44.980] - Speaker 1
Have there been any big movies post pandemic?

[01:08:47.560] - Speaker 2
There have been big movies. Top Gun was a really big movie. There was Spiderman during the pandemic. Avatar, the second avatar was bigger than was huge movie. But that's commercially, financially, have there been culturally impactful movies since the pandemic? I would say no. Now can there be. A lot of people would beg to disagree.

[01:09:08.900] - Speaker 1
No, but can there be?

[01:09:10.010] - Speaker 2
I have a theory. I'm very curious to your theory about this. I have a theory that Covid crushed the soul of artists in some way and we're seeing the result and it's tapering off. But in television business and movie business particularly, I think not interacting with each other in the world, surprise, surprise, was really not good for the beautiful artists in the world and the not good for anyone. It's not good for anybody. It's terrible for all of us. But the art that was created, at least in my view, in my world, really suffered. And I definitely think it's coming back. But I think you can't stare at your phone all day long and then create. Would you say the same? I mean, do you think that happened in music?

[01:09:59.050] - Speaker 1
I'm curious. I don't know. I'm curious, and I'd love to see a breakthrough movie where all my friends like, you have to go see this movie and you have to see it in theater. I would love that to happen. The last movie that I saw in a theater was Quentin Tarantino's last movie, and I loved it.

[01:10:14.930] - Speaker 2
It was amazing.

[01:10:15.840] - Speaker 1
I loved it.

[01:10:17.250] - Speaker 2
It was amazing. He's one of our great artists. How classy is it? I barely know him and I have no reason to kiss his ass. I just think if he sticks to it, I have so much deep, profound respect for someone who says, I'm making ten of these, and I'm out.

[01:10:37.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I have mixed feelings.

[01:10:40.490] - Speaker 2
Why?

[01:10:41.110] - Speaker 1
Because I want more.

[01:10:43.560] - Speaker 2
Is it just as a fan, as a consumer, I'm a fan.

[01:10:47.360] - Speaker 1
Why are you taking it away?

[01:10:48.320] - Speaker 2
You can still do it. I do too, but I will subvert that just because I think it's so. If he does it, it's so elegant. I've been thinking someone I was at a dinner for, we have a kind of a mentorship program. It's called scream writers, so young people who want to write scary movies. And I was asked a question, like, what haven't you done in movie or tv that you would like to still do? Right. It used to be an Oscar, but it's not on a bucket list anymore. I'd love to do. I'd live with it, but it's not like when I was 40, that's all I could think about. Right? And I said, a graceful exit. I have not achieved a graceful exit. And I think probably every business, that's nice, but certainly the movie and tv business, it seems hard for anyone to kind of have a graceful exit. And I just admire Quentin if he does it. A graceful exit. It's so elegant to me.

[01:11:44.140] - Speaker 1
I can't wait for the next one.

[01:11:46.170] - Speaker 2
Well, he's got one more. Yeah, he's got one. Yeah.

[01:11:49.560] - Speaker 1
So you said you think of movies and tv, content wise, as different things. What's different? Why is it different?

[01:11:55.710] - Speaker 2
Well, on a fundamental level, a television streaming multipart is much more character based, and a movie is much more plot based. A movie, you have to hit 20 points. You have a beginning, middle and end. And that's what movies are really about, is moving the plot forward, much less about getting to know the people. And television is about trying to get the audience to really intimately connect with who someone is because they have the real estate, they have the time to do that. So that's fundamentally the difference.

[01:12:26.060] - Speaker 1
Have there been any horror based series on tv?

[01:12:30.570] - Speaker 2
There have been a few. Mike Flanagan is probably the shining star. He's someone we've worked with a lot. He's a terrific filmmaker. Also the haunting of Hill House, and he's done a couple others. Actually, there's two people who do it, him and Ryan Murphy does it incredibly well, but it's much harder. It's virtually impossible to really scare someone on tv. First of all, you're watching in your bedroom, you're on Twitter, you're kind of whatever, you're distracted, the lights are on. And second of all, it breaks. And third of all, you're trying to make the story longer, so you can't properly scare someone with it. You can freak them out, the watcher, you can disturb them, but you can't really make them jump out of a chair like you can in a movie.

[01:13:15.300] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the state of the independent movie business. Current state.

[01:13:22.650] - Speaker 2
Let's see the current state of the independent movie business. As much as the tendency is to say like, oh, it's so much better because of streaming, or, oh, it's so much worse, or, oh, it's so much different, it's fundamentally been the same for the 30 years I've been doing this, which is that it's a fascinating business. It exits its own ecosystem. It's only probably less than 10% of the market. So less than 10% of the movies that any prequel see, well, less than 10% are actually indie movies, but yet independent. Sundance. I'm on the board of Sundance. I love Sundance.

[01:13:59.680] - Speaker 1
That's been the case for the 30 years.

[01:14:01.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's always going to see Star wars. They're not going to see anybody but in New York and LA, that's what everybody talks about is indie movies. But they have such a small place in the ecosystem of the overall movie business. But you don't take that in when you're living in LA or living in New York, which I think is interesting. And it's a wild business because the movie business attracts capital from all different places, usually rich people who want to play in the movie business. And they're always been a terrible investment, and they still are, but five times a year one sells for a lot of money and it keeps it going. And Sundance this year is not that different than Sundance 15 years ago. The dollars are higher, but it's kind of the same.

[01:14:42.520] - Speaker 1
Are you ever surprised by what ends up being commercial?

[01:14:48.630] - Speaker 2
Am I surprised by what ends up.

[01:14:51.510] - Speaker 1
You feel like, oh, this is not commercial, no one's going to like it, and then it really works?

[01:14:56.890] - Speaker 2
I mean, yes, for sure that's happened. I'm just trying to think of the examples. I mean, of course, that happens all the time. In insidious two, for instance, opened to three times. The first insidious opened to like 15. The next insidious open to $42 million. I thought the movie was same director. I thought the movie was very good. It was shocking that it was that successful. And yeah, the movie business, that's what's so fun about it, is the movie business continually surprises split M. Night Shyamalan's second movie we did. We did a movie with him called the Visit, and then we made this movie with him called Split. Split's our highest or second highest grossing movie of all time. Movie is terrific. It's amazing. I was at Sundance when it came out. It did $2 million on Thursday night, which on Thursday night, everyone is a kind of important night, but it's indicative of nothing. It's just there's a lot of pressure on it, but it doesn't exist. And I remember I talked tonight on Friday and he said, look, jason, I have a theory that if a movie does $2 million on a Thursday, it's a 20 multiple for the weekend.

[01:15:59.000] - Speaker 2
And I remember thinking like, you're insane, dude. Your movie is never day. Come Sunday. It did $40 million. The answer is yes.

[01:16:08.340] - Speaker 1
Wow, that's amazing.

[01:16:10.610] - Speaker 2
It's fun, that part of the business.

[01:16:12.930] - Speaker 1
How did you end up in business with him? Because he had done big budget mainstream movies before working with you.

[01:16:18.180] - Speaker 2
That's kind of a good story, too. We did three movies with him. We did the visit, we did split, and we did glass. And I told you paranormal activity was finished when we came on it. And there were two other movies that we did like that the visit was the second, and this other movie called Unfriended was the third again. But the best way.

[01:16:34.710] - Speaker 1
How did the visit get made?

[01:16:35.470] - Speaker 2
Best way to produce a movie, I'll tell you. So I went to Philadelphia well before the visit. Knight lives in Pennsylvania outside of Philly. I went to his camp. I pitched him Blumhouse. I said, you got to work with us. I pitched everything that I pitched. You here today, low budget creative freedom, all these great things. I had a ripped sweater. He always makes fun that I had a hole in my sweater. And I went back, I never heard from him again. Two years, goes by, calls me. He says, I did it. He said, what do you mean? He said, I did everything you said. I said, but what about with us? He said, no, I didn't do it. You. I did it by myself. I don't need you. I did it by myself. I put up my own $5 million. Why do I need your 5 million? Which was hilarious. I said, great. I said, good for you. I mean, congrats. He said, well, now no one will buy the movie. I said, well, you should have done it with us. I said, let me see the movie and the movie. It was then called Sundowning was the visit.

[01:17:29.970] - Speaker 2
And the visit was a similar thing as paranormal. It was similar. Everyone kind of saw it. Everyone had passed on it. And I watched it and I loved it. And I said, there's a great movie in here. And he rejiggered it a lot, and we did it with Universal, and it was a big success.

[01:17:48.140] - Speaker 1
Now that you've had the success that you've had with Universal over this period of time, are they more open to your.

[01:17:55.810] - Speaker 2
Universal is. They're the exact opposite of my early, other studio days. They're amazing partners. They'll go with, but now they look at you.

[01:18:03.990] - Speaker 1
Do they look at you the way you look at a filmmaker who makes something you like and you trust? Is that the nature of the relationship?

[01:18:10.810] - Speaker 2
100%.

[01:18:11.640] - Speaker 1
That's the best.

[01:18:12.170] - Speaker 2
By the way, most things that I give them, the quiet conversation I have is, can you please not make this? No, I'm making it in a funny kind of way.

[01:18:23.450] - Speaker 1
That's great.

[01:18:24.140] - Speaker 2
But they are incredible partners. If I. Anything that I really want to do, they pretty much do. And our deal is not exclusive with them. So some things we do with other people, and I almost encourage them. I'm like, guys, if you don't get this, don't worry about it. We have a good arrangement with Sony, and we have a couple movies coming out this summer with Sony, and it's a very great, you know, to your point, and you will understand this better than anybody, but my company wouldn't work without that. It just wouldn't just, it wouldn't be fun. It wouldn't be fun. You have to start from scratch after doing this so long. It's not worth it. It's just not so fun.

[01:19:00.500] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. You get to focus on the part that's interesting to you and they get to do the other part that they're good at.

[01:19:07.610] - Speaker 2
That they're great at. Yeah, it's good.

[01:19:11.210] - Speaker 1
Are there more independent producers who work the way you work? I don't know very much about the film business. No, it sounds like the perfect model.

[01:19:20.990] - Speaker 2
It's a perfect model for me. It's not perfect for everyone. Producers who make bigger event movies will do small movies as like a hustle, as like a little side business, which occasionally works. But it's very different than if that's the guys who did smile. Very jealous. I wish we made it. We didn't make it. Great producers, fantastic producers, but they mostly make big movies, so they did great with smile and God bless them, and it was a huge success. But it's a one off and it's our business. So that's very different because it's not sexy to make cheap movies just for reasons I talked about at the beginning of the podcast. Like there's this crazy golden rule. Like I'm producing $150,000,000 movie.

[01:20:03.380] - Speaker 1
Like somehow it makes no sense to me.

[01:20:06.110] - Speaker 2
I know, but it's good for my business because that's what everybody chases. So that's what the priorities at the studio, at the agencies. We have the DC movie, a Marvel movie. That's what people chase. It's good for us. And then there are indie producers who are definitely making low budget movies, but those movies are really targeted for that independent market like we talked about. So really a company that's solely on our movie business, solely focused on low budget studio movies, there isn't really anyone else doing that.

[01:20:37.460] - Speaker 1
In talking about the indie movie world, that there are these hundreds of pictures made that have no home?

[01:20:46.440] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:20:47.370] - Speaker 1
How do those get made? What's the thinking that allows hundreds of movies to get made with no idea how they're ever going to get out?

[01:20:54.720] - Speaker 2
It's the most amazing part of our business. It gets made because a little bit of what I was referring to is there's this kind of two things. There's a sex appeal to the movie business that attracts people with money. That's one thing. But the second thing is you read about the successes, you don't read about the failures. What you read about is the ten movies at Sundance that sold for ten figures. Sundance programs 150 movies. There are 150 new movies at Sundance. They've chosen from like 5000. Wow, it's crazy. How many movies, where are they coming from? They just get made, they get cobbled together and everyone has a dream. It's like buying a lotto ticket. Why do all these people buy lotto tickets when no one wins? It's a similar, I guess, now also.

[01:21:44.040] - Speaker 1
Technologically, you can make a movie with your phone.

[01:21:46.780] - Speaker 2
You can make a movie really on your laptop, very inexpensively. But it kind of says this amazing thing about who we are. Right. And it's all over the world. Movies come from Africa, Germany and Russia. And just so many, and people go out and they just do it. I think it's amazing.

[01:22:05.010] - Speaker 1
It's the best.

[01:22:05.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's great. It's great. All right, good.

[01:22:07.940] - Speaker 1
Thank you so much for doing this.

[01:22:09.260] - Speaker 2
Thank you.

[01:22:26.390] - Speaker 1
Technical rampage.
