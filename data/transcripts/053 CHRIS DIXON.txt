Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. I was given a computer. The original one was called a TRS-80. It was a radio shack computer by my father, who I didn't live with, and he had a business, and I think the business had gone defunct, and he sent me the computer. And back then, computers were mysterious, and there wasn't, of course, this was in 1982 or something. There was no real Internet. There were very little information about it. Actually, my older brother would go to school, and he would come back and learn a few programming commands, and then he would tell me about them, and then I would start playing around with it. And to me, it was this mysterious thing. I became obsessed. I spent age 10 to 23 or something, probably programming computers seven hours a day or something, including professionally for a brief period of time. Pretty similar, probably, to a lot of people who are in the tech industry of just falling in love with the process of programming. I think to me, it's a misunderstood, and that it's a very creative activity. So you, like I was making games and other kinds of fun things, but it's like you come up with an idea, and then you think about how you're going to architect that and how you're going to build that.

[00:01:29.840] - Speaker 1
And there was this little additional mysterious aspect to it of how does this machine work? And the machines back then were much simpler. Obviously, they've gotten much more complex. But a computer today has just massive amounts of memory and compute, and there's probably no human being on Earth, including the top experts who know everything about how this laptop I'm using works. Back then, one person could know the whole thing. And so, for example, the TRS-80 had, I think, 4K, 4,000 bytes, pieces of memory. I I later got an Apple, too, that had 48K. I think of bytes as like mailboxes or something, like slots you can put stuff in. A lot of them did different things, and you could learn what they do. Back then, pre-Internet, I go to these things called user group meetings, where I get my parents to drive me on Sundays to a school. And I didn't know this at the time, but I grew up right near an Air Force base called Wright-Patterson Air Force base, which turns out to be the intelligence and computing Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio. Amazing. Which I didn't know at the time, but in retrospect, that was a huge benefit to me because I'd go there, and there were all these guys who were older who would teach me stuff, give me books, give me software.

[00:02:39.710] - Speaker 1
I didn't know what they did. I think they probably worked something in the Air Force base.

[00:02:44.530] - Speaker 2
How old were you then?

[00:02:46.430] - Speaker 1
Like early teens or something.

[00:02:48.080] - Speaker 2
So early teens, and you go to a place, how many people would be there?

[00:02:50.930] - Speaker 1
Probably like 100.

[00:02:52.170] - Speaker 2
And typical age of the people there?

[00:02:55.540] - Speaker 1
A lot of them are older.

[00:02:56.820] - Speaker 2
Like 20s or 50s?

[00:02:58.820] - Speaker 1
Yeah, like 30s, 40s. These were like, this was the mid '80s in Ohio. And I think a lot of these guys worked at the Air Force base on computers, and they were hobbyists on computers. And you would go, and there were basically two things you would do at these meetings. You would pirate software. So you would copy games, because that's the only way I could buy games. I couldn't really afford them. And most people just did that back then. And there was actually a special hard drive you'd buy called the Happy Drive that let you copy the games. And then you would show them what you programmed, and you would trade those programs, and then you would teach each other. And so it's like a subreddit today or something, like a forum where you'd go and hang out and do that. And that was really fun and exciting. And so I was just completely obsessed and did that my whole childhood.

[00:03:43.310] - Speaker 2
Purely passionate. There was no idea that this is my job.

[00:03:46.400] - Speaker 1
No. In fact, later, I'll fast forward. I actually quit computers. I got into philosophy and actually went to school studying philosophy and then stayed for a master's degree in philosophy. I mistakenly, probably in the '90s, I felt like computing had gotten too corporate. If you go back in the '80s, the magazines about computers were like, you can still get them. It's like Byte magazine and Compute magazine. They actually would have code in them. You get the magazine, you type in the code. My poor mom would read me code, and I would type in. And that's how you got because it didn't have... There was some early Internet stuff. You could do, like BBS, as they're called, where you could dial in, use your phone line. So there's a little bit of that. But then what happened in the '90s is that if you look at it, all the magazines became productivity, Microsoft Office, and then the Internet hit. At that time, I was in college and thought I was counterculture or something, and was like, They've sold out. They've become corporate. I'm going to do something else. So there was no intention to do it as a job or anything else.

[00:04:43.750] - Speaker 1
It was just like... I I write about this a little bit in my book, I really view... I think software is really misunderstood. People think of it as an engineering field, and there is an aspect to which it's engineering, but the design space, it's symbolic manipulation in anything. And it's philosophers have shown this from the 1930s, there was a lot of work where anything you can represent mathematically or scientifically, you can represent in code. There's a thing called Turring Complete Code, like Turring Complete programming languages, which means anything you can really think of, you can write in code. So it's a very, very rich and expressive medium, which has all sorts of implications. First of all, it means just as an activity, it's fascinating because you can just invent things and invent new ideas and genres. I think the right way to think about software movements is analogous to creative activities and there's really new genres. When we talk about some of the stuff I work on, I think of it as a new genre. And I think similarly, a very common mistake people make is they write off genres. They look at it and they say, This genre doesn't make sense to me.

[00:05:48.430] - Speaker 1
But when you say that, what you're really saying is like, if you go back and look at the history of novels or something, when science fiction started off, it was considered an unsophisticated category in And this early mystery novels. And when you write off a genre, you're really writing off human creativity, because you're really saying, no one will come along who will write a great science fiction novel. Anyway, I think I had a very experience. It's very common to a lot of people that fall in love with software, which is the same way you fall in love with someone may fall in love with writing or music, of course. It's a canvas. It's a place you can express yourself. It's a creative medium.

[00:06:24.140] - Speaker 2
How did you come back to it after college?

[00:06:26.310] - Speaker 1
So I was in college. I got into philosophy through computing. There was what people would now call artificial intelligence. I mean, they called them, but now, of course, it's much more prominent. But how does a mind work? How does language work? Logic? That's the philosophy I was interested in. I actually was in a graduate program. I was in New York, and just by necessity had to program on the side to support myself. And as I was doing that, that was late '90s, I discovered the Internet startup world. And I guess I had grown up in an academic family. My parents are academics, English professors, like my whole family is. And I had a, I would say, cartoon understanding of business. And then for me, it was a real epiphany, late '90s with the Internet boom. I had a few friends. I was doing freelance work for them, and they started companies, and they was creative. They designed products. They had all these interesting people working there. And at that point, I don't know, around the year 2000 or something, fell in love with that and have spent my whole career in one way or another in that industry since then, when I discovered that there was this other...

[00:07:28.390] - Speaker 1
What I would describe as this other side of business, which is, to me, more interesting and creative, the tech startup world. And I also really fell in love with when I really dug into it, the Internet and the way the Internet had been designed, we took an amazing path on the Internet. In some ways, it was inevitable that we would network all the computers in the world. Once you have a bunch of computers, people had been started connecting them in the 1960s, and why wouldn't you connect those computers? But there were two At least two ways you could have connected those computers. One is a company in the middle of it. So AOL tried to do this back in the '80s. They started in the '90s, where they would be the Internet. Microsoft tried this, Disney tried this, Comcast tried this. They're the Internet, and you connect through them. The actual way the Internet developed was very different than that. It was originally a set of academics and government. It was called ARPANET, started in '69. And then it evolved as this community-owned resource. And it's amazing that in the '90s, it was truly the case that the Internet was accessible to everybody and owned by nobody.

[00:08:39.110] - Speaker 1
And it was just an amazing idea. When I fully dove into that and decided this is an amazing thing, and it feels like it's got a lot more room for development, and I want to be part of that.

[00:08:55.470] - Speaker 2
What was the experience of the Internet in the year 2000? When you remember the first things that you did, the first things that you would go to on a regular basis?

[00:09:03.980] - Speaker 1
The most popular homepage was Yahoo, and you go to Yahoo, and they would have a thing at the top called Site of the Day. And Site of the Day, it sounds funny now because the Internet is so big or I don't know, also so concentrated. There's social networks and all these other things. But you'd go and you'd click on the site of the Day, and it would be someone who's interested in some flower or someone who's interested in some weird hobby. And it would be these crazy crazy web pages with some of them had these crazy fonts and flashing letters. You can see them on Internet Archive and things. And it was just this serendipity. That's why they had the term web surfing. You don't really hear that anymore. But that was the term back then, because it was like you'd counter one thing and then another, and it was this constant process of serendipity. It's easy to forget. Or it was desktop, very importantly. There were no real... I mean, there were some early mobile phones, but no one not at scale. It was slow. I mean, the '90s, you had to wait for pictures to load.

[00:10:03.320] - Speaker 1
Video was very poor. It was very text-based. My book is called Read Right Own. The reason it's called that is I read. That refers to three years of the Internet. And the first year was a lot of people Internet veterans called that the read era. They called it the read era because mostly what you were doing was consuming information. You were mostly clicking around and reading stuff and maybe going to a search engine and typing something. And you could get an encyclopedia. A lot of websites looked like brochures. E-commerce was like catalogs. It was taking these things that we knew were familiar in the offline world and bringing them into the Internet. The bulk of it was consumption. I think Friends, the TV show, I believe it existed from 1996 to 2003. So that was well after the beginning of the Internet. The Internet does not occur in that show except for one episode, the entire show. There's one episode, and it's like one of the characters does online dating, and they all make fun of him because he's like, what nerd would do that or something? That was 10 years into the Internet, and you can make a show about pop culture that lasted seven seasons or whatever it lasted.

[00:11:12.600] - Speaker 1
There were these movies like You've Got Mail and things, but It almost didn't exist in movies till 2010, for the most part. Right now, of course, with mobile phones, many of the old plots wouldn't make sense because people are confused and don't talk to each other, and now they just text each other or something. But it It was just very different. And it was this concept of you go online. You wouldn't say that today, because today, we're continuous. Most people are continuously online. It's a continuous partial. It's seven hours a day, the average person is on the Internet, and it's on and off. And It's like your phone is always with you. Back then, it was like an event. You go online, sometimes you'd have that AOL, that beeping sound, and you've got mail. And it was like a thing, and you'd go get your tickets, and then you'd surf and check out a few things. It was very, very different.

[00:12:00.260] - Speaker 2
Should we walk through the book? It's the first thing I've read that explained blockchain in a way that I understood it.

[00:12:06.490] - Speaker 1
That's great. Yeah, and look, that's why I wrote it. I mean, I wrote it very much for the general reader. Blockchains, my view is that there are two cultures that are interested in blockchains. I call them the casino and the computer. The casino are people that, speculate on token prices and create websites. It's essentially a gambling culture. And then there's another culture, which I see myself as part of, which is a big culture. I think certainly tens of thousands of people, if not more, who have a very different view of what blockchains are. And I wrote the book because I felt like that second view had not been properly explained.

[00:12:48.900] - Speaker 2
I think no one knows about that second view other than those tens of thousands of people.

[00:12:53.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think that's my feeling. And so that's why I have a bottle of water in front of me. And to me, I've been working on the Internet for 25 years. The ideas in this book are, it's just the way I see the world. It's as clear to me as this bottle on the table. And I feel this frustration that I feel so wildly misunderstood. And that I'm not expecting people to read the book and change their lives and devote it to blockchains, but I wanted to just explain why people like me are excited about it. So that's the idea behind the book.

[00:13:28.760] - Speaker 2
Why do people How do you dislike the blockchain? What's the negative?

[00:13:33.360] - Speaker 1
So the thrust of the book, and the reason it's called Read, Write, Own, and the word own is there, is that blockchains enable digital ownership. And so that means that today in the digital world, there are very few things that you really own, that essentially you're always using, most of the time you're on the internet, you're using a service, and the things in that service, your username on Twitter, your friends on Facebook, your data, your audience, how the money flows, how control flows, these are all controlled by these centralized big company services. One of the main things that blockchains enable is that it can shift that control and that ownership back to the people that use the services, the creators, the users, the software developers. And so they enable ownership. And when you enable ownership, you enable trading and speculation. Think about homeownership. I think we all think homeownership is a valuable concept for society. It's important psychologically to own a home It aligns your incentives. People that own homes are more likely to take care of their home, take care of their community. I think most people agree homeownership is societally beneficial, but there are people that speculate on real estate.

[00:14:42.590] - Speaker 1
There are people that trade real estate. I think that for a variety of reasons, some of it is self-inflicted by the industry I work in. That aspect, this trading and speculative aspect, has gotten the lion's share of the attention. I think if you ask the average person, they'll say, Oh, the blockchain, that's these tokens like Bitcoin coin and these other things, and they don't have any real value, and they're just used for trading and speculation. There's an aspect of that, which is true in the same sense of if we lived in a world where you couldn't own homes and you suddenly could own homes, you would have speculation and things like this. And so I think it's partly self-inflicted. There are people in the community who talk about these things. I think it's partly the media likes to focus on that aspect. It's easier to explain. I mean, I had to write a book to explain.

[00:15:29.340] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think most people don't understand what it is.

[00:15:32.780] - Speaker 1
Well, and part of it, too, is I spent a lot of time... There's a lot of regulatory and policy topics related to blockchain. And so I go to DC, for example, and I talk to a lot of people who are not in the space. And what I discovered in talking to them is that it's very hard to describe blockchains because they don't have the prerequisite knowledge about the Internet. So in my book, the first third of the book is a background on the internet. And that background, I'll say, The first third of the book, I would say, is pretty uncontroversial. The last part, it may be controversial, the blockchain part. Or another way to put it is I diagnose how the internet went wrong in the first half of the book, and then I suggest a solution in the second half, and the solution involves blockchains. In the diagnosis, I think, one, I don't think that's controversial within the internet veteran community. That part is standard knowledge, but it's not common knowledge. And as a result, I found myself in lots of conversations, like an hour long conversation, just realizing, I just can't explain this in an hour.

[00:16:35.240] - Speaker 1
I blogged for years, I podcasted for years. I generally have this school of thought that if it can be short or it should be, I finally came to the conclusion this is just simply a topic that cannot be explained in under 200 something pages because it just requires this background knowledge, specifically, how did the Internet develop? And then how does power and money work on the Internet? Why was the Internet of the '90s an Internet where power and money flowed to the edges? And why is the Internet of today one where it flows to 5 to 10 companies? Why did that change? How does that work? What are the mechanics behind it? And so that's the first half of the book, is just talking about that and why that happened. And I think that's important because I think, as I said earlier, I got into the Internet, I think a lot of people did, and were inspired by this idea that it's this open, democratically-controlled system. I think that we have mostly lost that, and we're probably going to, if we don't do something, it's it's going to get even worse. I think we're very close to having an Internet of three to five companies that control almost everything.

[00:17:37.680] - Speaker 1
I think artificial intelligence, the stuff going on there is amazing. That said, it will most likely, if not, if we don't put in checks and balances, it will most likely further centralize that because it's a technology that rewards companies with large piles of capital and data. I worry that this was this miracle of history, that the Internet was this open decentralized system and not controlled by a company, but we may lose that. I think we're very close to losing that. If you just look at the data, and I cite some in the book, the top 1% of social networks account for 99% of their traffic. The top five social networks made $150 billion in revenue last year. That was 99% of the revenue of social media. You basically have now, if you go to a typical website now, it's cluttered with banner ads and other things. It's because everyone else is fighting over these tiny scraps that are left. I mean, why is the media industry in a state of peril? Because of Mostly because that mostly, because all of you basically have re-architected the Internet, where all of the power and money is getting sucked into the center.

[00:18:37.830] - Speaker 1
And so why did that happen? And how does that power and money work? So that's the first half of the book.

[00:18:42.020] - Speaker 2
Let's go through it. Why networks matter? Let's start really from the beginning. Okay.

[00:18:46.370] - Speaker 1
So the way I think of it is the Internet is a network of networks. And so you have the physical computers, and those computers all have a language for speaking to each other. And that language is called the Internet Protocol, and it's a technical standard where they all speak to each other. And that's what the Internet is. And then on top of that, what do you do? I used to be an entrepreneur, and now I'm an investor. And people who are Internet entrepreneurs and investors, what they do is they build networks. So the early networks were the World Wide Web. So some people think of the World Wide Web as the Internet. It's not. It's a network on top of the Internet. The Internet is a network that links computers. The World Wide Web is a network that links web pages. There's email. That email is a network. It's a communication protocol that's open and built on top of the Internet. Today, there's Twitter and Facebook. Those are networks. There's Uber and eBay, and just almost every Internet service you use the network. Why do I say network and not, for example, service? It's important they're networks because They have what are called network effects, which means that the more people that use them, the more powerful they become.

[00:19:50.480] - Speaker 1
And this is very different than the business world pre-Internet. In the pre-Internet business world, the businesses would accrue power through economies of scale and scope and being able to having the biggest factories, having the most efficient factories, the most efficient distribution. On the Internet, it's very different. You don't accrue power that way. You accrue power through network effects. Twitter is valuable because everyone else that you know uses Twitter. Facebook is valuable because the actual software they use and the servers are relatively easy to replace. It's the fact that the other people are there. And that is a very powerful force, because once you get that, once one of these networks is built, it's very hard to leave. If you're a creative person and you build an audience on one of these networks, they can change the algorithm. For example, recently, Twitter has been punishing people, a lot of the networks have, if you have a link to a substack because they see it as economic leakage. And so they demote your post if you do that. And that track down has really hurt a lot of businesses. What can you do about it? You're just stuck.

[00:20:50.140] - Speaker 1
You built an audience there. You can leave. So network effects are a very powerful force. And until recently, there were two main ways to build networks. And the first way are protocol networks, and the second way are corporate networks. And I have the first chapter of the book, I talk about protocol networks in the history and what they are and why they matter. In the second chapter, I talk about corporate networks. Protocol networks, the most prominent of which are email and the web, I analogize them to languages, like the English language. It's an agreement to speak in a certain way to each other. You can deviate from that, but then other people won't understand you. But if you think about in a language like English, you have dictionaries and things, but ultimately, it's a community resource. Nobody gets to decide. Maybe a novelist will be influential or someone else will influence things. But in the end, it's a group of people, all the English-speaking people in the world, in some complex, bottom-up way, determining what that is. And there's no central intermediary. And that's very much how the web and email work. So there are a set of standards.

[00:21:51.560] - Speaker 1
They go back to the '80s where people said, Hey, if you're going to send an email, do the following things. Use this code, use this code. And then what happened is this bottoms up group of software developers built email software, web browsers, web servers. And so you now have tens of thousands of developers, open source developers. Some of them work at companies who created this whole thing. And very importantly, there's You have a company in the middle. So there's no one in the middle who can-No one's in charge. No one's in charge. And that means no one can charge a toll. They can't take money. You have a website, right? And if people sign up on your website and use their email address, you can send them emails, and So you have these in between. You may use an email provider, but if they mess with you, you'll switch because you own the email addresses, right? And that's a very, very important part of protocol networks, is you own that website, you own that email audience. You can send them what you want. You can decide you want to put ads there, you can charge the money, you can not charge the money, there's no algorithm that's sitting in the middle, deciding your fate.

[00:22:52.340] - Speaker 1
And so protocol networks are a big reason why you had so much entrepreneurship in the '90s, because everyone got a little plot of land. You bought google. Com, and you could build an audience, and there was no someone in the middle today. Whereas you fast forward today, if you're on the app store or something, google takes 30 %. Google decides, apple takes 30 %. They decide they don't want you, and they just kicked the epic game maker off of the app store because they didn't like a tweet of theirs. So they're in full control. That wasn't the case with these protocol networks. So that was both, I think, societally beneficial, I would argue, but also economically beneficial because you created a set of incentives for people to invent things. No gatekeepers. You might think, well, isn't that going to be chaos and crime? And the reality is, look, obviously, there have been bad websites in history, but first of all, laws govern it. If you put up an illegal website, you get in trouble. And then secondly, this decentralized group of the email clients, the registrars, the website hosters, they all in a collective manner, take down the bad stuff.

[00:23:56.770] - Speaker 1
And the world hasn't ended. Had you just proposed it in 1990 and realized how important it was, a lot of people might have freaked out and said, You need someone who's in center controlling it. Like the way that people are debating around AI today, people are saying, Oh, you need someone to control it. What if it gets, you can't let the people have it? You need a gatekeeper because otherwise it'll be abused. It turns out that there were bad things, but they were mostly removed. For the most part, I think people would say that the Internet had a positive impact on society. It worked remarkably well economically, societally. Then, this is my core argument, in the 2000s, a couple of things happened. A good thing and a bad thing. The good thing was that the Internet got a lot more powerful. We were talking earlier about how limited the Internet was It became more powerful. First of all, we had broadband, mobile, the infrastructure got much better. But then also a wave of entrepreneurs said, Hey, the Internet so far is very passive. You consume information. What if we designed a new set of Internet services that were much more two-way.

[00:25:03.820] - Speaker 1
You could not only democratize information consumption, but also information publishing. This was known as the Web2 movement, also known as the Read-Right movement, which is, again, that goes to the title of the book. I was an entrepreneur then and part of that movement. It was very exciting because it was after the Internet crashed, broadband was starting, and there were a whole bunch of entrepreneurs who said, So far, the Internet, we've just taken brochures and cattle hogs and put them on the Internet. But really, this is a new medium. I have this distinction I talk about called skeumomorphic versus native. And so what this concept is, is that whenever, and this is borrowing from Marshall McLuhlin and people like this, but the idea is that whenever a new medium comes around, people often start off borrowing from a prior medium. And then over time, explore and understand what is truly unique to that new medium. So early films were like, if you watch them, they're like plays, and they hadn't discovered yet the close-up and the establishing shot. And then over time, you develop this grammar of film, and it becomes its own unique medium. Early, electricity was just a better way to make candles.

[00:26:09.810] - Speaker 1
You now had light bulbs. And then it took about 40 or 50 years before you said, Hey, let's standardize the plug socket and let a bunch of entrepreneurs come up with new ideas of tosters and washing machines. And that became native. And so in a similar way, in the 2000s, people said, Look, this is this new software-based network. Why are we just going and passively reading brochures? Couldn't you do all this other stuff? And specifically, can't you allow the user to participate as a first-class citizen and publish? And that was the beginning of blogging first. It began with blogging. And then I think of blogging as the primordial soup. If you look at early blogging, I was part of it. There was what was called link blogging, which was one sentence, which is now Twitter. And then there was photo blogging, which is Instagram. There's photo blogging, there was long form blogging, there was link blogging, there was what was called tumble blogging, which became tumbler. There were five different genres of blogs, and each of them ended up leading to a service that became very big, because that was all the primordial soup from which it all developed.

[00:27:14.820] - Speaker 2
What would be a typical link blog?

[00:27:16.870] - Speaker 1
I did this, too. It was just like you'd surf the web, and then you'd see something cool. It was almost like Twitter, except you'd be hosting on a blog, and so you go to my website, and I would just say, Look at this cool surfing website link. And the whole point was it was just short. It was just very short blogging. And it was just a genre. It was just a fun thing to do. And then you'd have an RSS reader. An RSS reader would let you aggregate all of the blogs that you follow. And so you would just be scrolling through, and then you'd see someone wrote five pages, Someone wrote a paragraph. Someone else had six links they found that day. And it was just this serendipitous thing you went through. And it was fun because it was just other people instead of only going to professionally made websites, right?

[00:27:56.420] - Speaker 2
And again, there was no gatekeeper in that scenario.

[00:27:58.800] - Speaker 1
No gatekeeper. Rss is still around. It's a protocol network. In the 2000s, at one point, and I was part of this, I used to blog about this a lot. I was a big supporter of RSS. Rss, I think of it as up until 2008, was actually a genuine rival to the corporate alternatives like Twitter and Facebook. It was the open versus the closed, and it was a real horse race. And if you look at the data, they were actually close. And there was a moment in which in this alternative history, social networking developed as an open protocol with no geek keeper, as you say. But then for a variety of reasons, which I outlined in the book, it ended up losing out. It still exists in some podcasting things, but it's very niche. If you walk down the street and ask somebody, how do you consume social media? Very few people say RSS anymore.

[00:28:43.680] - Speaker 2
Tell me why it lost out.

[00:28:45.650] - Speaker 1
It's interesting. It lost out, and this leads into blockchains. I summarize it as two things, features and funding. So when you went to features, what I mean by that is in 2000, let's say, seven or eight, if If I wanted to create a blog, I had to do a couple of things. I had to go register a domain name that cost $8. You have to go to whatever, GoDaddy. You have to go fiddle with some dials, so to speak, to set up a website. You had to then set up your RSS reader, and then you go to Twitter and Facebook, and it's one click. You type, I'm C Dixon. Boom, one click. Look, the protocol, like email on the web, they developed in the '80s. It was a bunch of academics and tinkers, and there was no Twitter, corporate alternative. And so People were willing to jump through some hoops. Protocol networks ask you to jump through some hoops. That was fine in the '80s and maybe the early '90s. By the 2000s, you had these alternatives, and they made it much, much easier, number one. Number two is funding. The example I use in the book is YouTube, and this is something I see in my daily life, which is essentially the way you build these services is through heavy subsidization.

[00:29:53.850] - Speaker 1
In the case of YouTube, as an example, YouTube was started in 2005. At the time, it was one genre of new video sites that was social video. There was an explosion of video startups then because broadband Internet hit a certain level of penetration. And entrepreneurs are smart, they figured that out. A bunch of people were going in licensing CBS content. Youtube took this more bottoms up, peer-to-peer approach if anyone can upload something. But their main feature was actually that they would subsidize the web hosting cost. It was very expensive in 2005. So if I wanted to have a video on my website, it was very expensive and time consuming. And so what YouTube started off doing was that I could go upload a video to YouTube, and then I could embed it on my website. That was actually the original feature of YouTube. It was not to go to youtube. Com. It was to use it to embed, and they would pay for the hosting costs. And how did they pay for it? They raised venture capital. The venture capitalists gave them money because they calculated that if they can get a bunch of people to start using YouTube, that eventually, instead of going to my website, they just go to youtube.

[00:30:56.320] - Speaker 1
Com, and eventually it would be this big place where you'd have this inventory videos and this big audiences. And they were right, by the way. That was what... Obviously, Google bought them in 2006. Basically, the calculation was, let's subsidize this cool feature because the prize at the end is this very big economic prize. If we control global video, which they do today. So it was a smart economic calculation. And so that was very hard. There was a thing called MediaRSS at the time that was an open protocol that was intending to compete with YouTube, but they didn't have any subsidization. You had to pay for your own hosting. You had to get a domain name. You had to fiddle with dials. It just wasn't a competitive product. Sadly, I was part of that RSS movement. I blogged for years. I was a supporter of these things. And then when mobile phones came along, it really accelerated the different... Because the corporate ones, they had these slick mobile apps. And then just adoption. If you just look at the number of people with computers, it went from 500 million to 5 billion over that, from 2008 to the next 10 years.

[00:31:58.880] - Speaker 1
So RSS was actually We widely supported until about 2012. And 2012 is when Twitter removed it, Facebook removed it, Google shut down their RSS reader, and it just became this hardcore nerd thing. And then since then, more and more consolidation around these 5-10 companies. And sadly, the only protocols that still exist that have any scale that people care about are email and the web, although even those, I think, are under attack. That share is declining of time spent. You probably still go to a browser sometimes Sometimes, but the percentage of time people spend online is more and more within TikTok and Twitter and these things. Actually, the services have gotten more aggressive about not letting you link out. And they see it as leakage in their system, and they want to keep you there. And so for a bunch of reasons, I worry that we're fairly soon going to just... They're still going to exist, but that the relevance is going to be steadily declining.

[00:32:53.210] - Speaker 2
It was something I just learned recently that Instagram, in some parts of the world, it's mainly used as a communication device.

[00:32:59.760] - Speaker 1
I20th. It's interesting. Yeah. I don't know the exact data on it, but email has definitely been... It's still used in corporate context, but young people, it's texting, WhatsApp, Instagram, DM. It's in severe decline.

[00:33:11.450] - Speaker 2
So after the corporate version, next comes blockchain. Yeah.

[00:33:16.230] - Speaker 1
So the summary in the 2000s, right, is I think we made this Faustian bargain. On the one hand... Let me just say the good side, so I don't sound too negative, which is the good side is we now have 5 billion people using smartphones. They have a lot of access to a lot of free services. Thanks to open-source software and free services, you can buy a $10 Android phone and get on the Internet and participate. And so I think generally the Internet has been a very positive thing. I think that along the way in that process shifted over to using networks that do have gatekeepers that are controlled in a very centralized way by these companies. And that has had, I believe, has increasingly negative effects. If you think of a social network as a two-sided network, meaning they're consumers and creators, the main effect is on the creators. And I also think of the software developers because in my world, I work with them. They're on the creator side. So the so-called supply side has been mostly negatively effect. And so if you go But why does someone go to TikTok? They don't go to TikTok to see TikTok's content.

[00:34:18.170] - Speaker 1
They go to see the people on TikTok. Yet those people on TikTok are not making any money. Tiktok is making many billions of dollars through advertising and other things. Those people are not getting paid. Sometimes they have these deminimus creator programs, but they're literally sub 100 % of revenue. They're not material. And so what you have, and you may have friends like this, I have friends like this, you have to go and basically do all of these gymnastics to make money, to go and a sponsorship or sell body spray or do This is what these people do. Youtube, by the way, is the exception. They do a revenue share. Every other social network doesn't. They take all the money.

[00:34:50.480] - Speaker 2
In both cases, you don't own your audience.

[00:34:53.530] - Speaker 1
You don't own your audience. They can remove you, and that's the most prominent thing, which is called de-platforming, which we've seen happen, especially in the pre-Elon Musk Twitter era, where activists, political figures were removed from the platform. That's very politically charged, obviously. There's also something that's much subtler called shadow banning, which we know happened. It does happen on all these networks, which is you're still on there, you're still using it, but your tweets don't show up or they don't show up as much. I think a much more nuanced version of that is there's dials essentially inside of these companies, and they can just turn the dial and they can say, I want less of that person and more of that person, right?

[00:35:32.170] - Speaker 2
Why would the gatekeepers care about this?

[00:35:34.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah. In the book, mostly I talk about economics. So there's a political dimension, potentially. I think with Twitter, pre Elon Musk, there was maybe a political motivation. And a lot of these tech companies have There's a lot of social media and social media, and it's really not really your typical motivation. So there's that. But I think it's primarily economic. And so let me explain. So TikTok started off... It blew up four or five years ago. It was relatively recently. It was been around for 10 years, but it got really popular a few years ago. And it got popular with a A few creators who had hundreds of millions of followers. Social networks don't like that. They don't want to be dependent on five people. They want to have thousands of people with a million followers, not five people with 100 million followers. And so you hear this again and again from people that build audiences on YouTube and TikTok, they turn the dials. They turn the dials so that they have a more diversity of people that they depend on. If they get too big, Mr. Beast gets too big, Joe Rogan gets too big, he cuts the deal with Spotify.

[00:36:28.100] - Speaker 1
He leaves YouTube. Number one, Number two, how do these networks make money? When you go to a feed, there's two types of posts in the feed. There's what's called organic and promoted. Organic is just not paid for, and promoted is paid for. When you go to search, by the way, same thing. You search and there's ads, those are promoted, sponsored, and then there's the free links. So all of these tech companies are basically predicated on the idea that if you go read the Wall Street reports, they have to grow revenue year over year. You can't be a tech company and not grow revenue. But the problem is, you take a company like Google or Facebook is they've saturated the world. They can still grow somewhat, but they've got many billions of users. So how do they grow revenue? They grow revenue by shifting the mix of promoted and organic. If you notice this, like Google, for example, on your mobile phone, most of the times you search, you'll get almost all ads or Google products on the first page. Amazon, you'll see more and more of the page is taken up with sponsored links. Same thing in all of these services.

[00:37:27.210] - Speaker 1
By the way, this is all a pure capitalist. They're just maximizing profits. They're doing what smart businesses do. And by the way, a lot of them use AI and other things. So this is probably happening by machines doing it and things. But the machine's saying, How do we optimize profit? Okay, this person got to a million followers. Now, let's turn down the dial. And if they want to keep growing, they're going to have to pay for it. They're going to have to pay for sponsored links, right?

[00:37:48.200] - Speaker 2
If we go to something to get clear information, and what we're getting back is promoted information, and sometimes we don't know which is which, it's really confusing.

[00:37:59.100] - Speaker 1
I agree. I mean, I think particularly, Google has become a mess. There's not really any choice. There's Bing. There's not actually any other... There's DuckDuckGo, but that's actually Bing. There's not really choices. It's a lot of their own properties. So Yelp used to be the top link. We've searched for a restaurant, it used to be the top link, and they demoted them. They put the Google restaurant. So this got so bad that the CEO of Yelp was in front of Congress saying, Hey, this is not fair, unfair competition. And then, search for travel right now. On a mobile phone, I don't think you'll get a single actual or organic link. It'll be all paid for. Look, when I use these things, I'm always immediately scroll down to the organic stuff. But most people, I don't know if they know that, and they probably get bad results. And by the way, even the organic, I mean, the organic things, too, are highly skewed these days, too. And I think it's severely diminished the utility of these services. I mean, Google started off, remember, very famously, with no ads on the page, they eventually added one link at the top, and it was very clear, it was this big blue border, Don't be evil.

[00:38:58.740] - Speaker 1
That was their motto. And they were referring to other Internet services that had too many ads and were deceptive. And that was their whole thing, was like, We're going to keep it clean and simple and not do that. And I think it's severely degraded the quality of the Internet. Even the organic is messed up because of this huge industry that's around gaming. It's called SEO. And it's like, how can you optimize to get up there? And then there's other consequences. This is also getting to AI. It's like, Well, if you're a content site, how How do you make money? When you make money, Google doesn't pay you. They take snippets. When you have a news site, you say, Google, it's okay if you index me and you use my content, just send me some traffic back. But then they'll do stuff like, they'll do this thing called One Boxing, where they'll actually, if they use Wikipedia, they take the content and just show it, and maybe they'll put a link down here, but it doesn't get clicked on. And so then you have this whole other problem, which is people are giving their content and they're not getting clicks back.

[00:39:58.620] - Speaker 1
And so that's What that's doing is it's just anyone who's not one of those five companies who's just trying to run a website is in freefall from a business point of view, which is why outside of maybe the top five newspapers, the rest of the media industry is going bankrupt, essentially, as an example. And we haven't talked to AI. I think if you're an illustrator, before generative AI, you could put your illustrations online and maybe show up in a search engine and then get some clicks and then maybe put some ads or have a subscription. In this new world, people are just going to get the image. They're not going to click through. So there's a whole another wave of this coming. And so I think it's created all these downstream negative incentives that not only is it degrading the search results, the social network experience, but also all the things downstream that depend on those things, right?

[00:40:49.960] - Speaker 2
We haven't got to blockchain yet.

[00:40:51.810] - Speaker 1
Okay. Do you want me to talk about blockchain? Yeah. So the origin of blockchain, it was a 2008 white paper by a pseudonyminous character named Satoshi Nakamoto about Bitcoin. And the word blockchain actually didn't occur in that paper, but he talked about blocks and chains. And since then, it's become a term people use to describe a computer system in this design. Bitcoin was designed to be a payment system that had no gatekeeper. A payment system, going back to what we're talking about, protocol networks that are democratically owned and controlled, Bitcoin was designed to be a financial system where there was no gatekeeper, no boss, no one in charge, just the community. That was the idea, and that's what the paper talks about. Bitcoin is its own interesting thing, and it's evolved, and it's got its community, and it's its own thing. But what happened in 2015 is that a group of people And so we said, What if we took that same architecture, and instead of just focusing on a financial system, we made it a general purpose computer? So think about, analogize it to a Blackberry, free iPhone. You had a Blackberry. It was a computer that did one thing, basically.

[00:42:00.300] - Speaker 1
It was like email. But then Apple came along and had an app store and said, Anyone can write an app for it. And so you can think of Ethereum as saying, let's have... It's not literally an app store, but it's like that. Anyone can write software for this blockchain. And then since then, people have... Ethereum has evolved, and people have created variants on Ethereum and other what I would call programmable blockchains. And then people build applications on top. And that's when I, post-Ethereum, got really excited about it and said, this is really interesting because to me, it a lot like a computing movement. And so we have a history of computing movements. So computers were invented in the '30s and '40s. And then you had mainframe computers and mini computers and PCs and the Internet and mobile phones and AI. And in each of these cases, you had these programmable devices or systems. And in each case, you had the early computers that came out, like the early PC. And then you had a bunch of enthusiasts come along and make stuff for it. And then at some point, some of the stuff they made got really popular, and it grew It's like a hockey stick.

[00:43:00.910] - Speaker 1
And so when I saw Ethereum, to me, Bitcoin was interesting, and I was into it. But then I saw Ethereum, and I'm like, wow, this is really interesting because it's an open canvas. You can design. It's software. You can build anything on it. I refer to blockchain as computers in the sense that you write software for it, they store information, they operate on that information. That's what a computer is, defined by its functional properties. But it's not a physical computer. Ethereum is not a device. It's a virtual computer that exists on a network of other computers. So Ethereum today has, there's something like 30,000 what are called validators that are computers that run. And when you submit code to it, it's actually submitted to those 30,000. And those Every thousand, so often, every minute, come together and say, This is the state of this computer. And then they run code, and then they... Functionally, it behaves like a computer, but it's this computer in the sky that's owned by nobody and accessible to anyone.

[00:44:00.070] - Speaker 2
How similar is that to Bitcoin?

[00:44:03.160] - Speaker 1
That architecture is very similar. A blockchain is a computer that runs on top of these networks of devices. And the difference is that blockchain has one application that it runs, which is the Bitcoin application, which is this application that says you can have a Bitcoin, there's only going to be 21 million bitcoins. You can't double spend. It's like a set of financial rules that underlie the Bitcoin system. But that's the only application. It's like a computer, we have one app. Okay. Ethereum is a computer where you can upload any app. You can write anything you want.

[00:44:33.980] - Speaker 2
My understanding of the benefit of Bitcoin is because of that 21 number, it creates a limit. You can't print money.

[00:44:43.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah. The fans of Bitcoin tend to be people who are concerned about inflation. They tend to be fans of Austrian economics, Milton Friedmann, Hayek, that thing. And they see the main benefit is you can't tamper with the supply. Yeah. And I think that's interesting, and we could talk about that. Ethereum has a different idea, which is Bitcoin is interested in money. Bitcoin is for people that have views on money. Ethereum is more tech. So it has less of an opinion on money. And there is a token that's called Ether that it uses, but it uses it more as a fuel for the computer. So whenever you want to run software on the Ethereum computer, you have to pay for it with Ether. It's like a time share system. System because it has limited resources. And so you pay for it, and you pay for it with a token. And then it uses that payment you made to pay the hosting providers who run the code. And so it has this little microeconomy. And so when you buy Ether, you're not making some statement about inflation or economics. It's more you're saying, I think this computer might get more popular and more people will want to enter this economy.

[00:45:53.590] - Speaker 1
So it's very different in that sense. So I think it gets lumped into it. And that's partly because if you don't dig into the details, you just see this, Hey, this is a thing. It has a price. And it must be like this. But it's actually quite different. Bitcoin is this monetary thing. The people involved in it are much more political as an example. The people in Ethereum tend to be more interested in the tech. The people in Ethereum are more probably like me, concerned about the Internet and big tech. The people in Bitcoin are concerned about big government. Maybe that's the way to put it. So there's different reasons. Blockchain world is very broad. You name it, there's some weird community that has a blockchain. So it's a much more complex... It's like the Internet or something. There's websites that do this and this, and there's just different genres and movements, and the same thing is true here. And so a natural question you'd ask is, why go through all this trouble? Why not just use a regular computer? I like to say blockchains are computers that can make commitments. So Bitcoin, it commits there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and it commits that in the core code of the system.

[00:46:57.340] - Speaker 1
You can't change that. You would need all All of the people that run the software that probably think there's at least 100,000 of these miners to all collude, basically. Actually, technically, you need 51%. You more than have to collude to change that number. Actually, with Bitcoin, you'd need not just the 100,000, you need all the different what are called wallet providers. You need Coinbase. You need this vast array of people to collude. So it's just not going to happen, and it's never happened. And in the 15 years it's been around, nothing like that has happened. And so it's probably about as strong assurance as you're going to get in the world that there's this 21 million limit. And so it makes a set of commitments, and those happen to be financial commitments. With Ethereum, you can make other kinds of commitments. You can make a commitment that, for example, you can build a social network on Ethereum, and you can say, I commit to the following rules. If you're a creator, I chart, and you make money, you get to keep the money. If you build an audience, you get to keep the money. You can do whatever you want.

[00:47:55.510] - Speaker 1
It's software. As I would argue, the Internet today is one you can't really trust these companies, that they change the rules, they change their privacy policies, they change how they handle data, they change how they handle... We were just talking about how Google has changed over the years. Blockchains, you can make a search engine, you can make a social network, you can make a game, you can make a financial service, where the rules are baked into the code. The code is open source. Anyone can go look at them, and they can't change. So that's why I call them computers that can make commitments. And yeah, you can build all these different kinds of applications. And what we're seeing now since the advent of Ethereum is more and more people building things, including things like social networks and games. And that's what I do in my day job is invest in those things.

[00:48:35.170] - Speaker 2
How do we know that they can't get corrupted? Let's use Wikipedia for an example, which is an open platform, but a lot of the information on Wikipedia is not correct.

[00:48:45.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Wikipedia is an interesting case. I think that it's probably more political organization than most people realize. If you just go look at their budget and how they spend it and all the different donations they make and things like that. Look, anything in the end can get corrupted. It's how does it get corrupted, I guess I would say. For example, the most popular operating system, and the one thing we haven't talked about yet is open source software. So open source software began as this radical movement in the '90s. Today, 99% of software in the world is open source software. People may not realize this, but Linux is probably 99% of the operating systems in the world. So every Android phone runs on Linux, every server in the world. This is a operating system made by a community of software developers. Could it get corrupted? Yeah, it could, but it's thousands of people. It's all open. You can go on GitHub and you can go read it. If it changes, anyone can audit it. You'd have to go and get all those thousands of people to agree to corrupt it. What would be the incentive? There's no incentive.

[00:49:50.260] - Speaker 1
Maybe your company could hire people and try to bribe them or something, but it's decentralized enough that it has stayed pretty good for that whole time. The And the insurance is that blockchains are similar. Everything is open. All the Ethereum's code, anything you write for it is open. It's all auditable. There's nothing that's closed, meaning you can just literally go and look at the code. If you're not technical, you can hire somebody or you can have third-party monitors. So it's all open. So you don't have to trust somebody. And then it just is designed in such a way that it requires a whole bunch of people with different sets of incentives to collude to corrupt it. Anything in human affairs can be corrupted, but it's designed to be highly resilient to it. It was funny that there was prior work to Satoshi, the Bitcoin paper, including a dissertation in the '80s by a guy named David Chaum, who was a computer scientist, that was the inspiration in some ways for Bitcoin. The paper was essentially the title was something like How do you get a bunch of adversarial actors together to act in concert? That's a lot of what Ethereum and Bitcoin are.

[00:50:53.240] - Speaker 1
Is there these game theoretic designs that create these incentives that make it very hard to corrupt the And so you can actually calculate, for example, on Ethereum and Bitcoin, the cost it would take to bribe everybody. And I think on Ethereum, it's like $50 billion or something. There was a paper that just came out recently on it. But that's how they're designed. They're designed in such a way that they assume the worst.

[00:51:17.540] - Speaker 2
Would there been a way to design Wikipedia that assumed the worst and where it was actually honest?

[00:51:24.720] - Speaker 1
That's a good question. It doesn't have any incentives. It's all based on reputation. So one of the reasons that in blockchains, there is this financial element, is you need the financial element to be able to design the incentives to make... Because what you talk about in blockchains, when you talk about the security, is the cost to attack it. So I have to think about that. But You need a Wikipedia with incentives in such a way that you have a cost to attack it. It's a very relevant question, by the way, because it's about to happen with AI. The big debate now around AI, is should it be open source?

[00:51:56.410] - Speaker 2
In most cases in history, when there are gatekeepers involved, usually the gatekeepers turn out to be the bad guys.

[00:52:04.440] - Speaker 1
I tend to agree. I think it's the Winston Churchill, the only thing worse than democracy is every other form of government. I think the same is true of computing systems. I'm generally a fan of community control. They're chaotic, they're messy, but it's probably better than every other, essentially what you have with these corporate networks is monarchies. And Linux is a democracy, and the web is a democracy, and Facebook is a monarchy, and which is better? And maybe those work for a while. Maybe they have a benign monarch, but at some point, you probably don't, right? And is that what we want for the Internet? Do we want to have it be set up in a way that we have five people to control it? And you see it with Twitter. Maybe you liked the people before Elon, maybe you like Elon. But then there's a secondary question of, should How does that matter so much? Should it matter who happens to own this thing that the global town square can trade hands like that? Shouldn't it be owned by a community? I think that that's the fundamental problem, is that you even allow that to happen.

[00:53:16.320] - Speaker 1
And communities are messy. And like you said, maybe Wikipedia has gone off the rails. I don't know. I think in theory, by the way, going back to your Wikipedia question, one answer is what's called forking in code, right? Which forking is you copy it and create your own version of it. And you can do that with a computer. It's all open, you can copy it. The challenge with copying it is then how do you... The Wikipedia is valuable because you've got some person out there who's taking care of the page on Jupiter and someone else is Abraham you're thinking. If you copy it, how do you get that community? And also, how do you make sure it shows up in search engine results? And how do you make sure it... So there's all this stuff that makes it sticky, the current Wikipedia. But in theory, it's voice and exit, right? Are the two, famously, the ways to have political influence, and the exit is forking in computing world. You copy the code and you leave. There are other interesting things, like prediction markets are interesting. There's a whole history of this, which is letting people basically make bets on what's going to happen in the future and what facts are true.

[00:54:17.370] - Speaker 1
And there's a whole interesting area of research there. There's been, famously, the CIA actually launched a prediction market. I think it was the early 2000s as a way to predict disasters. The idea was you could let people bet on, is there going to be a terrorist attack? And even though that sounds awful, they shut down within three days because it was so controversial. But the idea was that, wouldn't it be better to surface that information and then try to prevent that attack? And the one way to do it is market. Markets are basically... The stock market is like when Tesla stock goes up, that's a bunch of smart people making a bet that Tesla is going to sell more cars in the future. And so there's been a lot of work around trying to create better information systems.

[00:55:02.430] - Speaker 2
Do you know what that CIA operation was called?

[00:55:05.430] - Speaker 1
I had to look it up. I could send it to you after. Yeah. It was like... Because I used to follow prediction markets, and I remember seeing that, and then literally, I think it was like a New York Times article the next day, and then it immediately shut. I can't believe they actually did that. I get the academic motivation, but the pragmatic reality of it didn't play well.

[00:55:28.080] - Speaker 2
So we're back to the benefits of Ethereum Ethereum.

[00:55:30.820] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So you can build. So for example, we're investors in a relatively small but emerging social network called Farcaster. And what's interesting about Farcaster is it's like Twitter or something like this, except you own your name and your audience. And just like with web browsers, you can switch software. So if you think that one piece of software, you don't like how they change the rules or the ranking or the way they look or the ads or whatever, you can change it and you control that. And if you build an audience, you own that And if that service is messing with you and trying to take your money and do things, you can change that. So one interesting question in the future is people spend more and more time playing video games, and soon they'll use virtual reality headsets and there'll be these giant virtual worlds. And will these worlds be similar to what we've been discussing, controlled by five companies, or will they be more like the World Wide Web? Will they be open systems where anyone can add another part type for that world and can open a store and create goods that they sell or create music or create art or whatever they might want to do?

[00:56:38.530] - Speaker 1
And so using a blockchain like Ethereum, there's a wave of entrepreneurs who are building new Internet services, financial systems, like we've mentioned Bitcoin, and there's other kinds of things around payments and lending and whatever you might think. Social networks, media, I think is very interesting. So you would know much more than I do, but I don't think that Spotify and things have been particularly good for musicians in many ways. By their own stats, I think Spotify stats is something like, of the eight million artists, less than $20,000 make $50,000 a year or more, so the average American salary. So obviously, if you're a major artist, you're fine. You have many ways to make money, but if you're a smaller one, you aren't. There's a famous blog post, a guy named Kevin Kelly, who was a co founder of Wired, he's a brilliant author, wrote a famous blog post called a Thousand True Fans. And the idea was that the Internet, this is in the early 2000s, he wrote this, The Internet was going to change the economics of creativity because prior to the Internet, you had to get mass media, you had to get on the radio.

[00:57:39.180] - Speaker 1
You had to play in stadiums. And that was because you had all these intermediaries taking tolls along the way, and you would only get a small percentage of it. And the idea, and this was the hope in the '90s and early 2000s, is that the Internet would change that because you'd have a direct relationship. And he called it a thousand true fans because if you do the math, let's say somebody loves you, I'm a chef, and I have great recipes, and they love me. Can I get a thousand people to pay me 20 bucks a month? Ten bucks a month. That's $10,000 a month. That's $120,000 a year. That's a living, right? And so the dream was we would have an Internet of millions of people pursuing niche interests is not having to sell out to mass audiences, building direct relationships. And this is what should have happened and didn't happen. Right now, we fast forward and you look at the economics of Spotify or YouTube or TikTok, and we're back to the mass market audience, right? The mass market logic. And so what you can do on blockchains like Ethereum is you can build Internet services that I like to say that combine the best aspects of corporate networks with advanced functionality.

[00:58:41.400] - Speaker 1
You can use things like I discussed earlier, subsidization, because blockchains have economic models, and they can subsidize things with tokens and other things. Today, you can build, like the one I mentioned, like Farcaster. It feels just like a modern social network in terms of onboarding and all the other kinds of things. You can build things that really compete with these corporate networks, but which, because of the commitments that blockchains can make, have the societal benefits of protocol network and let shift power to users.

[00:59:06.830] - Speaker 2
Let's use Substack as an example because that's a new model, but it's not built on a blockchain. Is that correct?

[00:59:12.720] - Speaker 1
That's right.

[00:59:13.600] - Speaker 2
How would Substack It has to be different if it was on the blockchain?

[00:59:17.640] - Speaker 1
Well, so Substack... Look, my firm is an investor in Substack. I'm a fan of Substack. So Substack is built on an email. And so you go to Substack and you get people to sign up and they give you your email address, and it helps you manage that. And It charges 10 %. And I think that Substack founders are great and well-intentioned, but the reality is you have no assurance as a user that they won't change that later. That's the difference with the blockchain, is that that 10 %, there's no assurance that the data privacy policies won't change. And look, I've been doing the Internet long enough. I remember when Twitter had all these policies, it was open, you could download your stuff, you could do this. The reality is over time, what happened with Twitter is that they raised a bunch of venture capital. They didn't have a business model. They finally decided with their venture capitalists that the only possible business model was advertising. At the time, for five years or so into Twitter's existence, they didn't have an app. You couldn't go to the app store and download Twitter. You download Tweetie, Twitter later, TweetDeck.

[01:00:17.990] - Speaker 1
There were like 50... It was like the Internet. You just go download a browser. They didn't have an app. Then what happened is they raised money. They needed to do ads. They realized to do ads, they had to have a controlled a sanitized environment. They had to own an app. They bought an app. They shut down the ability for other people to make apps. And fast forward, it's a Twitter of today. So if you follow the history of these Internet services, they often start off very friendly, very low rent, because in the beginning, they're a startup. They have to, right? Actually, in my book, I have a whole section on this. I call it the attract-extract cycle. And I argue that every corporate network goes through this cycle. And so when it starts off, it's, of course, it's a startup. It has to attract people, and It's doing everything. It's being as solicitous as possible. It's trying to get people to come in over time. So every technology follows an S-curve. This is not my idea. This is just standard knowledge. There's an S-curve. It starts off slow. If it works, then it moves up really quickly.

[01:01:13.670] - Speaker 1
And then at some point, you run out of people. If you're successful enough to get to the top of the S-curve, at some point, if you've been really friendly, Hey, I'm friendly. I'm open. You can build stuff. It's low take rate. At some point, you raise money. Probably the founders are gone. Most of these companies, the founders are gone. It's run by a professional CEO, and they're going to be like, Why are we charging 10 %? Let's charge what we should. Why are we letting these other application developers on here? And this has happened over and over and over in the last 20 years on the Internet. The only large tech company still run by the founder is Facebook. At some point, the corporate logic takes over. Look, as they should, they're fiduciaries to their shareholders, and they are going to maximize profits. And the logic of maximizing profits when you own a big network is to start to extract from it at some point. So what I like to say is blockchains are, instead of don't be evil, it can't be evil. You bake it into the logic of the code. You can dislike me, you can dislike everybody I work with, you can not trust us, but it's just like Linux.

[01:02:12.720] - Speaker 1
You don't need to like me or trust me. It's in the code, it's open, and you can go look for yourself. And that's the assurance. The assurance is a game theoretic design that makes it very hard to corrupt, and the rules are in the code. That's the difference. That's what a blockchain gives you, that an existing Internet service does. And I would say, even if you trust all these folks, I do trust a lot of these entrepreneurs. I work with them. But eventually, the corporate profit logic just has to take over. It's just the nature of these things. And people leave, and management changes. And if you don't do that, you get fired, right? Because if someone else is going to come in and double the profits, you can only sustain that so long. Having computers and Internet services that make these strong commitments is valuable.

[01:02:58.750] - Speaker 2
The next section of the book is Community Created Software. Tell me about that.

[01:03:03.260] - Speaker 1
Okay, so maybe just a little bit in the history. So up until the 1970s, the way you made money in computing is you sold hardware. Companies like IBM would sell big machines. And then Bill Gates came along, and he had a contrarian idea, which is, I'm going to sell software. And at the time, software was this stuff you gave away with the hardware. That was a contrarian idea. And he was right. So it turned out that the value was in the operating system, and the hardware became interchangeable. Whether you had a Dell or a compact, It didn't matter. What you needed was to have Windows and to have Office. And that was a brilliant idea. But then what happened is this ragtag group of left-wing activists, which is how open-source software started, Richard Stahlman and MIT, who didn't believe in property rights. Software should be open and free, they started creating all these really interesting software products, including all these variations of what's called Unix, which is a really powerful operating system. And in the '90s, Linus Torvolts, who was the creator of Linux, took these ideas and, I would describe it as, made it a more pragmatic technology movement, as opposed to being politically motivated.

[01:04:09.060] - Speaker 1
And he built Linux, which is a, fast forward today, the most popular operating system in the world. People started building every level of software, so web servers, databases. And at some point, the software industry realized, wait a second, we're not going to be able to keep selling software because people are making it for free. A group of people on the Internet who don't that know each other are coming together as a community and writing software. And it turns out that software is open. It's great. Actually, this surprisingly happened. Companies prefer to use that software because they can see the code. They want to be able to see the code. They don't want to trust Windows. It's free, but really the more important thing to them is they can see the code and they can change the code. And so people like that. And so open source became more and more popular. And then what happened is the tech industry moved into, if you follow the tech industry, you'll hear this buzzword of software as a service. Okay, we can't money on software anymore, so we'll move up to doing services. So services means... I think anything you need internet service for is a service.

[01:05:07.550] - Speaker 1
Netflix is a service. Microsoft calls themselves a services company now. Office, Adobe is now a service. And their idea was, well, we can't really sell software anymore. Selling shrink-wrapped $59 software, downloadable software is not going to work in a world of open source. We're going to sell services, right? So I think a very interesting thing that happened along the way is that people realized that a community could come together and actually build better technical software than companies. There's a famous essay from the '90s called The Cathedral and the Bazaar by a guy named Eric Raymond, and he was in the Linux movement and talking about this. And he calls it The Cathedral and the Bazaar because the idea is Microsoft as the cathedral, and You have these priests. They're secret, and they're in this tower, and they're creating this magical thing called windows. And then you have the Bazaar, which is this cacophonous, chaotic mess of people, but they're markets or something, like a bazar. Someone will create something, something will be good. You'll take two steps forward. Someone makes something bad, but then other people will come along and fix it, and maybe someone will suggest something.

[01:06:11.500] - Speaker 1
And together in this chaotic way, they end up creating better software. He had a famous phrase, With enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Meaning no matter what bugs, like a security flaw, a mistake in the software, just by making it open, you see them, and they're more secure, and you end up actually having much better software. And so a very surprising thing, I think, if you were sitting in the '90s, just to fast forward today, is that literally 99% of the software in the world is open source. It's just amazing how much it won. And I think that's, by sense, that's underappreciated outside of the technology industry that most of this. By the way, even your Apple computer is probably 70% open source. And then Android is basically fully, and all the back-end stuff you connect to from your computer on the other side, that's all open source. All the new devices, VR, self-driving cars, they're all Linux, open source, so just completely dominated.

[01:07:03.520] - Speaker 2
Would blockchain be considered open source?

[01:07:06.700] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, for sure. If you're not open source, you'll be immediately rejected and banished from the community. It's deeply embedded in the ethos. The limits, though, of software, right? Linux is a piece of static software. When you actually want to run the software, you got to pay money to host it, to pay for electricity, to pay for bandwidth. And that's why the tech industry was able to move up the stack and charge for services. There's no open way to run services. And these communities can't come together and fund that. They don't have financial... They're a bunch of hobbyists. So how are they going to create a community-owned Facebook? How are they going to create a community-owned Netflix or something? It just has these operating expenses that can't be created that way. And so in that section, one of my arguments is that one of the interesting things about blockchains is they let you make essentially community-created services. They do that partly through this economic model. So earlier, I described the Ethereum token. And so the way it works with Ethereum is you pay money to access the system. When I say you pay money, it can be the software provider can pay the money in the same way they pay hosting costs.

[01:08:12.050] - Speaker 1
So it's not something the user necessarily sees. And that then money cascades back out to pay for the electricity and the hosting costs and everything else. And what that means is, for example, you can have a social network where one person creates the client software and somebody else creates the algorithm for the feed, and somebody else... Basically, all these different people come together and create these services. And software, we talk about the concept of composability, and composability is software as Lego bricks. It's the idea that you can take these small pieces and put them together and build interesting things. And that's one of the main reasons why Linux has been so successful in open-source software is one person comes along and builds one little Lego brick, and someone else builds another Lego brick, and then someone else combines those two Lego bricks, right? And you have all of humanity be coming together, and you get this compounding growth of knowledge. And blockchains have a similar way of doing that with services. So you can have one person can come along and add a little bit to this new game or social network or financial service, and someone else can come along and do it, and then collectively, they build through Lego bricks these services that end up going back to Cathedral and the Bazaar.

[01:09:21.980] - Speaker 2
How do these collectives communicate?

[01:09:24.530] - Speaker 1
With open source code, most of it happens on these websites like GitHub. There are communication in the code. There's things called pull request where you make some change to the code, and then you ask for it to be included. And then they have these forums where they discuss it, and they have... It's like forums.

[01:09:41.730] - Speaker 2
But there's a whole community where people who know how to do this stuff know where to go to be able to be involved.

[01:09:48.350] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, for sure. For sure. Yeah. And these are very large communities, and they exist around open source code, they exist around blockchains, and there are millions of people who participate in these communities.

[01:09:59.980] - Speaker 2
Take rates.

[01:10:01.790] - Speaker 1
So a take rate in any network or Internet service, there's money flowing through the service. And so, for example, when you use Uber, you pay some amount of money, and the driver or receive some amount of money. The take rate is the business term of art for what percentage of that money that the operator, like Uber or the company takes. So the take rate of Internet services varies widely. Social networks like Twitter and Facebook take 100 %. And what that means is they run ads and sell products and do other things to make money. The aggregate revenue of the top five social networks last year was $150 billion, so they make a lot of money. And then they basically, with some minor exceptions, don't share that with the people who actually create the content on those networks. Apple has a 30 % take rate. And what that means is if you create an app, and this is actually a big There's an active area of discussion going on now. Spotify is suing Apple, and a bunch of other people are, Epic, the maker of Fortnite is very unhappy with Apple because of this take rate.

[01:11:09.460] - Speaker 1
Anything you do in the app store, if you sell products, if you're Spotify and you sell a subscription, if you're Netflix, you sell a subscription. If you're a game and you sell premium service, 30% of that money goes to Apple, which is a very high take rate for providing payments. Typical payments, credit cards are 2.5%. So they charge 10 times Android does the same. And by the way, if you notice, you ever tried to buy an audiobook in the Amazon app? And you can't, and they'll say you can't do that, and you have to go to the web browser. Why is that? Because Apple charges 30%, in the app, and Amazon doesn't want to pay that. And so you have to go to the web, which is the last area of freedom on your mobile phone as a legacy of the open Internet, where they can't do that. The web, the browser on your phone, for cultural and other reasons, is the one place Apple won't touch because it's been around for 40 years, and it's always been free, and people will get really upset. To take rates is the economics of networks. It's how much of the money...

[01:12:16.220] - Speaker 1
So just one way to picture it is you've got a network and it's a bunch of nodes. People are sending information and money and other things back and forth to each other. And how much money does a gatekeeper take? And in protocol networks, which I I talked about earlier, there is no gatekeeper. Therefore, there is no take rate. It's all free. That means that you make a website and people pay you $100, you get $100, period. But on the app store, they take 30 %. On Facebook, they take 100 %. On eBay, they take, I think it's 10 %. So it's all over the map, and I go through it in the book. The take rate, basically, none of it is... It's not like eBay charges less because they're nicer. They charge less because it's easier for you to switch. If you're selling shoes, you can go to StockX, right? And Facebook, it's very hard for you to switch. So it has to do... Basically, the take rate is higher when it's harder for you to go to alternatives because the more you're stuck, the more they charge, is how it works. And so the main point of that is that there's a lot of money at stake.

[01:13:16.180] - Speaker 1
There's many trillions in dollars in value, if you look at the value of these companies, many hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. And how that money flows, does it flow to the center of the network, the owners, or does it flow to the of the network has to do with how these systems are designed. Had the world evolved differently and had RSS and an open protocol been the dominant way in which we build social networks, I believe that that 150 billion in revenue that those social networks make would go to the edges instead, which is 2 million jobs at the average American salary. I think I have a section in the book on the fall of RSS, which sounds like an arcane, weird technical thing. My view is it's the most impactful event of the history of the economics of the Internet. The fact that social networking is owned by five companies and not why isn't it like the web? Why is information delivered in this open way? Why is email delivered in this open way? But once we add friends into it and audiences, it's now closed, right? And all that money gets rerouted.

[01:14:23.840] - Speaker 1
When people think about things like having these gatekeepers, they tend to think of the political aspects. They can de-platform you because it's very visible and it gets a lot of attention. But I would argue, and that matters, but I would argue that the economic impact is really what matters, is the most important thing. And that has to do with these takeaways, where does the money flow.

[01:14:48.910] - Speaker 2
I'm personally concerned with censorship because living through the explosion of hip hop in the 1980s, all of the gatekeepers were trying to ban hip hop. So I've seen beautiful movements from the ground up be stifled. And it's really a miracle that we know about hip hop.

[01:15:08.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, I come at it more from the tech angle, obviously, and you from the creative. I think of it like My partner, Mark Andreessen, he created the first popular web browser, which then led catalyze the growth of the Internet. I don't think the web browser would be allowed in the App Store today, in the Apple App Store. One of the first things his boss at the University of Illinois said was, Can you remove the porn? No, you can't remove the porn from the web. We are not pro-porn, but it's an open system, right? And that would be something Apple would say, Hey, you have the new system where anyone can do anything, including make a bomb, tell you how to make a bomb. It's just an open... It's a web browser. And I think you're right. I don't know the creative side as well, but I think that anything that's outside of some Overton window is probably not going to be allowed. Maybe there's some exceptions, like the new Twitter or something. But I come from the view that most interesting innovation comes from the edges. Absolutely.

[01:16:09.280] - Speaker 2
It always has.

[01:16:10.880] - Speaker 1
And so it's worrisome, right? That you'd have these systems that close that off and do so from a deep platform. Like I said, there's these subtler things. There's shadow banning. It's like they wouldn't just have to ban hip hop. They could also just demote it, or they could censor certain words, or they could... Youtube does There's a lot of things where they demonetize. So they allow you to stay, but they don't let you make money off of it. So there's a whole range of ways in which... That get less attention, but are still very impactful.

[01:16:43.390] - Speaker 2
When you're demonetized, does that mean they don't put advertisements in your-And you can't make money.

[01:16:48.890] - Speaker 1
You'll see this. If you go on there, you search for that, you'll see all these people like, because they did something that the sensors didn't like, they can't make money, and they'll be complaining about how they're demonetized. And they won't put ads, and they won't share. And obviously, they don't get revenue then. And their business goes away overnight. They're completely dependent. You can't switch because your audience is there, and all the things you built are there.

[01:17:11.700] - Speaker 2
Building networks with token incentives.

[01:17:14.210] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So this is where blockchains are inspired by the video game industry. Maybe I'll talk a little about the video game industry, which I think is very interesting. I think William Gibson famously said, The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed. And I feel like that about video games with respect to media business models. They have been very pioneering with new ways to think about business models. And to rewind to 1990, the video game industry was similar to the music industry in that you sold the video game. It was like 50 bucks or 30 bucks, and you'd buy a video game, right? And that's how music was sold. You'd buy an album. The Internet came along. And fast forward, most video games today actually don't charge for the game. They give away the game for free. Like, Fortnite is a good example, League of Legends. And instead, they charge for virtual goods. So in Fortnite, you buy skins and dance moves. And why do they do that? Because they realized that the Internet is a giant copy machine. The Internet likes to copy things. And when you create media, there's a trade-off between giving something away for free and charging for something.

[01:18:23.680] - Speaker 1
Because when you give it away for free, you can let the Internet do its thing and spread it around. People can stream it, they can remix it, they can chop it up. And the video game industry said, You know what? Let them do that. You can take Fortnite, you can stream it, you can remix it, you can play with it, you can play it for free. And you go to social media, you go to YouTube, and video games dominate because of that. And they said, You know what? We're going to figure out a different way to make money. We're not going to charge for the game. We're going to make people so into these games, and it becomes their social life that they're going to want to buy an outfit so that they look cool around their friends. And Fortnite is three billion in revenue last year selling virtual outfits. That's how they make money. And so what they did is, I call it the attention monetization dilemma. There's a trade-off between giving something away and charging for something, right? Whereas the music industry evolved somewhat during the course of the Internet. It moved from selling albums to streaming services, but still has the same basic economic model, which is you charge for music.

[01:19:27.260] - Speaker 1
Maybe now you do it through a bundle. By the way, as a And as a result, if you look at the music industry, it's mostly stayed flat in terms of its revenue over the course of the life of the Internet. In the same time, video game industry has gone from 25 billion or something similar to the music industry to 180 billion during that period. Part of it is video games have gotten better and things like this, but I think a lot of it is they've been really aggressively experimenting with new business models. They basically have created these small mini economies in these games. There's a game called Eve Online It's a very famous game that is a spaceship battle game where millions of people play it, and there's an entire economy inside of the game, and you can buy spaceship pieces, and there's all these other crazy... They actually hired, famously, an economist. There's a big New Yorker article about the economist, and they have interest rates. And there's a lot of video games like this where they have these economies, and they have these microeconomies. And so blockchains, Ethereum and blockchain systems, were inspired a lot by video games, and including this idea of creating these economies with virtual goods.

[01:20:28.500] - Speaker 1
And the idea is with something like Ethereum, where you allow people to pay, and then you create this little microeconomy, and the more people that come into the economy, the more they want the token, and they can go up. In addition, you asked about token incentive, specifically. Okay, so one of the interesting ways in which these little mini economies can be effective is the following, which is one of the hardest things about building a network is what's called the cold start problem, which is think about a dating website. If If you're the first person on a dating website, it's utterly useless to you. If you're the hundredth person, it's probably pretty bad, too. Once you have a million people, maybe it's good. And then once you have 100 million, it's unstable. No one can compete anymore. And so when you're creating a network, you At the beginning, it's really, really, really hard. How do you get over that hub? And then later on, it becomes much easier. But that early hub is a problem. So as I described earlier, YouTube helped try to get over that hub by subsidizing, by saying, Hey, you can have free hosting.

[01:21:31.830] - Speaker 1
And this has been a long... My entire career, this is not blockchain. This is just the Internet business. It's like, how do you build networks and how do you incentivize people early on? This is like there's books and theory because it's like, if we're in the network business and the hardest part of a network is the cold start, is the beginning, how do you get over that? Like, Airbnb famously gave out cereal boxes and did free photography and this and that. Facebook famously started at Harvard and then went to other schools. It was a whole series of tactics. With blockchain, one of the interesting things is you have these economic models. And so what if you use those economics to help get over the cold start problem? And so the idea is provide incentives for early users, like financial... Like early users, if you join, you get rewarded with a token, and that token gives you some upside in the future development of the network. Imagine an early Uber, right? So early Uber, you're trying to get cars on the network. You give each of those drivers. Every time you drive somebody on a ride, you get a token, and that token eventually is connected in some way to the value of Uber as a service.

[01:22:40.640] - Speaker 1
And that value will decay over time. The first person who does it gets five tokens, and the hundreds gets three tokens, because at some point, you don't need to give them out anymore, because at some point, they can just get paid for the driving, and they don't need extra incentives. And so the whole idea is you taper them. And so there's been some really cool experiments. So there's this long-time dream among technologists to create a grassroots telecom company to compete with Verizon. So this goes back 30 years. So there was, for example, MIT had a thing called RoofNet, and the idea was everyone would put a telecom, a 5G receiver on their roof, and they would all... Then it was a mesh network, so they would all talk. This is pre-blockchain, right? So they would all talk to each other. I put one on my roof, and it would be a 5G telecom thing, but it would also talk to you on your roof. And they got everyone at to do on the roof. Actually, New York City has a pretty cool one called NYC Mesh, and it's this mesh network of a bunch of Wi-Fi things.

[01:23:36.360] - Speaker 1
I've been involved in these things for a long time. It's really cool because what if you get everybody to sign up for one of these things? And then you could have this telecom system that's not dependent on these big gatekeepers like Verizon. So this is like old dream. I've talked about this idea for 20 years. There's a company called Helium that is a blockchain-based company, and what they do is the same idea, except what they do is they They give out token incentives early on. And so they say, if you put up one of these systems early on, the first person gets X tokens, the next person gets a little bit less. And they did this five years ago, and they got basically the entire United States covered with these Helium stations. So it was a really cool thing. Now, they originally had... They were using this... Instead of doing 5G, it was this esoteric IoT Internet of Things standard. So they They picked the wrong thing and then have switched it. Now, they actually have a service. You can sign up for it with your cell phone, and it's growing and it's interesting. They basically bootstrap the network using these incentives in a network design that had a giant cold start problem an entrepreneurs had tried to solve for 20 years.

[01:24:48.830] - Speaker 1
And so the really cool idea is, what if you could do that with other kinds of networks? For example, there are people doing it with electric charging stations. Anything where you need telecom, electric charging stations, financial systems, social networks, anything where you need a large group of people to do it, what if you use various financial incentives early on to get over that early cold start problem? So that's what that section is about. The other interesting thing, I'll give you another example of an idea I'm excited about, which is it's called collaborative storytelling. And so the idea there is, what if the next Harry Potter or Star Wars was created by a fan community in the same way that you You have Wikipedia, but you have a creative fan community who gets together and creates those worlds? You think about how excited people get talking on Reddit or something about Star Wars. People get really into this stuff. It's like a fantasy football league. Exactly. It's like fantasy football They all get together, but it's like fantasy storytelling. They come together, they create a narrative world. They get rewarded for their contribution through tokens. And you have to have a system for doing that.

[01:25:56.660] - Speaker 1
If you contribute more, you get more tokens. And there's a whole bunch of mechanisms for doing that. And then if that narrative universe gets made into a movie or something else, they get some portion of the proceeds. And then what's really cool about this idea is it's cool for the community because they now, instead of, they used to mention fantasy football, instead of just being passive observer, there are actually participants and can come up with these stories. But it also is cool because it solves a problem for Hollywood, because why is Hollywood making sequels all the time? Because it's so hard to market a new narrative universe. So what if instead you had this million people come together and create it, and then they become the evangelists for this new world? You already have the fan base built in. So this is another example where token incentives are used. By the way, that idea, too, we're about to have a world of AI, where generative AI will let you create a movie cheaply and let you create art cheaply. In that world, I think you're going to have a deluge of media. I think the valuable thing will be having communities of people people around that media who care about it.

[01:27:02.570] - Speaker 1
And the way they have skin in the game and get rewarded is by having some piece of that system. And that's what tokens are for. So blockchains enable users to own parts of the digital services they use. Tokens are the mechanism by which that ownership happens. A token is a unit of ownership, and it can represent a Bitcoin. It can represent an Ether, which is like gas or what you need to run software there. It can represent a piece of a It's a narrative universe. It can represent an identity on a social network. It's a very broad and expansive concept. It's a unit of ownership on the Internet.

[01:27:37.790] - Speaker 2
Next is network governance.

[01:27:40.250] - Speaker 1
Network governance. So network governance is a little bit what we're talking about with deep platforming, which is if the Internet is a network of networks, how are those networks governed and controlled? The web is this mishmash community of software developers and nonprofit organizations and internet service providers and all these other people who come together. If somebody does something really bad and you're a web hosting provider, you might take them down and someone else will take them down. The community in this messy democratic way effectively governs the worldwide web and email. If you look at modern Internet services, they're effectively controlled by a single person or single company, but the companies are ultimately controlled by one person. Sometimes, I assume the content filters on YouTube aren't actually happening by the CEO. They're probably some group of people that are anointed by the CEO. But essentially, YouTube is owned by Google, and all Google services are ultimately controlled by Google and whatever policies they want, and they have various opaque committees. Who knows what the rules are? I don't know what they are. I would liken it to we let AT&T decide who can make phone calls.

[01:28:53.450] - Speaker 1
At&t made really good phones, and they made really good phone lines, but does that give them some special ability to decide who can use those things. It's very strange to me that we've allowed these opaque groups of product managers the ability to decide what is correct pandemic information, how the economics of the Internet work, how Who's allowed to say what? It doesn't seem like a good idea to me. I think the way that the web did it was much better. I think that as we've now seen, I think 10 years ago, a lot of these systems were... Social media, for example, was dismissed by many people as somewhat frivolous and unimportant. I think it's now very clear that it's extremely important. And I think it's now time to think harder about how these networks are governed. One of the things that a blockchain allows you to do is it allows you to encode the governance of a network in software. And so you could write software that says, I'm going to give the power to... In one case, you could write software that says, It's a dictatorship, and Chris Dixon controls everything. I don't think that would be a good design, but that you could do that as software.

[01:29:59.510] - Speaker 1
You could We also design a system that says, Anyone who has a voting token is allowed to vote on it. And that's actually a very popular way to do it. People do today. Other systems anoint power to a group of foundations. The point is that you Now, for the first time ever with blockchains, because remember, they're computers that can make commitments, you can write code that says, Here's how the network is governed. Essentially, it's a little bit like the move. I like it in the book, to move towards constitutional governance. You can now write down the governance. There's very interesting experiments going on in the blockchain world where people are trying different kinds of governance systems. For example, Ethereum is much more... Ethereum itself and Bitcoin are much more governed like the way the World Wide Web is by the software developers effectively vote on what system they want based on which software they choose to adopt. There are other systems, a whole bunch of things in this area called DeFi decentralized finance, where they have tokens. There's a system like Uniswap Compound where they have tokens, like this system Uniswap and Compound, where they have tokens, and the token holders actually vote.

[01:31:03.460] - Speaker 1
And these are very active discussions and votes where they actually go and they vote regularly on someone who submits a proposal and they vote on it. And the vote affects how the code works. If you vote one way, the code changes. And that's interesting. There's other ones that have bicameral systems, meaning two houses. So the token holders will vote on something, and then there's also a set of appointed foundations and things. And it's very interesting. And so now, for the first time, there's this, I think, this interesting experimentation going on in the future when we have these important systems, when we have games, virtual worlds, social networks, financial systems that end up being very important in our lives, how are those systems controlled? And so for example, we have a guy named Andy Hall, he's a professor at Stanford in the Political Science Department, and he's now working with us and writing all these papers and studying it because for him, it's this really exciting new test bed for governance systems. And until now, on the Internet, you just had these old systems like email on the web, and then you have everything else designed as a dictatorship.

[01:32:04.420] - Speaker 1
And now you, for the first time, have a way to really, in a nuanced way, design new governance systems. So that's another interesting thing that blockchain has enabled.

[01:32:13.280] - Speaker 2
Is it fair to make comparisons between the physical world and the digital world in the way rules are created, or is it just so different that you can't compare it to the physical world?

[01:32:27.820] - Speaker 1
A lot of the things I think about have analogs there. So as I just mentioned with governance, we've had thousands of years of governance in the physical world and experiments, and obviously, some have gone well and some not well. And I think most people think that we, I would say, haven't really fully figured it out, but have some sense of what works. I think on the economic side, I think about this a lot. I have a bunch... And throughout the book, I have these analogies to cities. I think cities are very interesting and have a lot of analogies to the digital world. And I'll explain that. Because cities, in many ways, are networks. New York City gets more valuable to me because of the other people that are there, because of the businesses there, because of the parks that are there, because of the streets that are there. I think a very important aspect of cities is a balance between public and private space. The street is owned by the public. The sidewalk is owned by the public. The entrepreneur who starts a pizza shop knows that it's owned by the public and therefore knows that nobody's going to...

[01:33:27.960] - Speaker 1
If it were a private road, someone could They come along and charge rent to walk down that street. If it was a toll road, it's not a toll road. They know they'll get foot traffic. They can depend on that. They know there's a park nearby. In a city, you want both. You want the open streets. You want the people to walk around. You want the parks. And that's very important to give the assurances to the residents and the businesses that certain things won't change. Certain things will be the way they are. But you also want incentives for entrepreneurs, because I don't think the city probably should be inventing new restaurant sites like the creative entrepreneurs do. And so I think I've lived a lot of my life in New York. I think parts of New York have this feeling of working really well and balancing very well between the public and the private. Cities are also bottoms up. I mean, they have mayors and things, but most of the energy in a city comes from the people. And by the way, every attempt at planning a city generally hasn't worked well. The best cities have been organic and bottom up.

[01:34:26.180] - Speaker 1
I think it's very much true in the digital world. So to me, the worldwide The web is like New York City. It's a balance. The web itself is like those streets. It's open, like the transport. I go to a website, and that relationship in between, I'm walking down an open street. The website might be a nonprofit, it might be a for Profit. They vary. The for-profits know they can build a business there because they know the streets are free. And so you have this really healthy dynamic where you have this public and private space. This is the '90s, early 2000s internet. That's why when we were talking at the beginning, the Internet had that serendipitous feel. I think it had that feel of New York City. You turn a corner and there's this antique bookshop, the chess store in the-Washington Square. Washington Square Park. Washington Square Park. Yeah, exactly. So that stuff. I love those chess stores. Yeah, it's like these stores that just... Where else but New York City, would there be a store where the guys are all in the back smoking and playing chess? But that's what makes New York great, and that's what made the early Internet great.

[01:35:31.900] - Speaker 1
And I think it really had to do with this. To me, it was about the bottoms up and the balance between the public and the private. And now what we have, what I worry about with these five companies that control the Internet, TikTok, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, is it's all private space. Where do you get that bottoms up energy?

[01:35:49.710] - Speaker 2
Do you trust Facebook?

[01:35:53.130] - Speaker 1
Well, in what sense? I trust them all to act like profit maximizing companies, which they will act like.

[01:35:58.210] - Speaker 2
I was going to ask you for each of them. Do you trust Facebook? Do you trust Microsoft? Do you trust Google? Do you trust Apple?

[01:36:03.740] - Speaker 1
I think you need to look like Charlie Munger, show me the incentive, show me the outcome. In some ways, Microsoft is the best because they sell... Microsoft is an enterprise software company. Don't forget, they sell software to businesses. Enterprise software is, in some ways, the most honest part of the tech industry because you just have a customer and they pay you. There's no data sharing, there's no advertising, there's no privacy policy. They They just want you to buy Word, like an Excel, and you pay your whatever it is, 200 bucks a year. Whereas I think the ad-based companies, I think it's become very adversarial. They have this incentive to track you and follow you around. And by the way, Apple and Amazon have large and growing ad businesses. I trust Apple when they sell me a phone. I trust that Apple because they just want to sell me a nice phone. When they start layering and advertising, if you read Wall Street reports about Apple, I love Apple. I've used Apple devices my whole life. I think they generally are a good company, but I do worry that their focus is on services. If you read the Wall Street reports, all their growth, they're not growing by phones.

[01:37:10.370] - Speaker 1
That's basically tapped out. They're growing by services, which means the app store fees, the payments, Apple Pay, all these other things, and advertising. They have a $40 billion advertising business, and they famously cut off. They did this change to the iPhone where it really hurt Facebook and Google, the tracking, then it seemed like a It's a privacy move, but then they layer on their own advertising. So I think the incentives matter. What's the business model? The advertising business model is by nature adversarial, I think, because you just want to collect more and more data, and it just becomes this cat and mouse game. So I think that the best tech businesses just sell you a product, and that's generally business software, like Microsoft. No, I don't particularly trust them. I just think that they're going to do what they do to maximize profits, and that has generally not been aligned with the user and the internet's interest, in my opinion.

[01:38:02.120] - Speaker 2
Why do you think people are so concerned about digital currency in general?

[01:38:08.460] - Speaker 1
You mean the negative side, the pushback? Yeah. I think there's different threads to it. I think there's a one school of thought. There's this thing called a central bank digital currency. I don't know if you've heard of this. Okay, so there's a move to basically create a US-issued, US government-issued dollar, and to move all of the banking infrastructure to that system. And So essentially, the government would have the ability to issue money, to send money, and to decide who can send money, and monitor all the money, and all the other, full control. That's going to be a big political issue in the in the last couple of years. Yeah, and if you followed the Canadian trucker thing, this was a big flash point where there was a protest in Canada with truckers, and basically they had their banking account shut down. It happens in my industry, with blockchains, a lot of companies have trouble getting bank accounts. It's not... They don't even have tokens and cryptocurrency. They just literally have the word blockchain on their website, and it's hard to get a bank account. There was a famous thing called Operation Chokepoint 10 years ago, were like gun companies, I think marijuana companies, a lot of other outside the Overton window.

[01:39:15.230] - Speaker 1
You talked about the Overton window earlier. In some ways, one way to look at the world is the last battle was who gets to talk on social networks. The next battle is going to be who gets access to the financial system. And that's become more and more of a political issue. And having money controlled by the government will heighten the stakes.

[01:39:31.090] - Speaker 2
Does it concern you at all?

[01:39:32.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm concerned about it. I mean, look, because we deal with it in our business where we have a lot of companies that just simply can't get bank accounts, and they're perfectly within law. I'm a big believer in rule of law. I think there should be laws, and our companies obviously should follow them. But if you follow the law, you should be able to get a bank account, I believe. Yes. And that's not necessarily the case. So there's become this extra paralegal, outside the legal system. So why are people concerned about digital currency? I think the people that are proponents of these central bank digital currencies see things like Bitcoin as a threat to that because it's not in that world. And this is a very live political issue. There's a thing called the Stablecoin Bill that's made in the next year or two become law that has to do with how... So stablecoins are cryptocurrency, blockchain-based tokens that represent US dollars. There's one called USDC that's very popular. So it's a token that exists on the Ethereum blockchain, and I can send you a USD token, and that represents It's a dollar, and you can redeem it for a dollar.

[01:40:32.000] - Speaker 1
And it's become very popular. Last month, there were $600 billion of USDs he sent around. It's very popular in the developing world. I've never been heard of it. Yeah, it's very popular in developing world, like in South America. That's something like 18 % of Argentinians own some stablecoin. The last stat I saw.

[01:40:49.190] - Speaker 2
Is that owned by someone?

[01:40:51.680] - Speaker 1
There's a company called Circle that's one of the issuers. It's just they have a bank and then they are audited. Well, this is what the stablecoin bill. This is a bill that's being proposed and it's working its way, hopefully through Congress, that would put rules around it and say there's different issuers, and probably every bank might have their own stablecoin in the same way banks issue credit cards or something. But then credit cards, it would all be interoperable and transparent to you, and you just know it's a digital dollar. There's going to be regulations around it. Money is very regulated, like the Bank Secrecy Act, KYC, sanction controls. That's not a debate. That's going to happen. The question is, do you go farther than that and actually let the government decide who can have this extra layer of control and say, you get access to digital dollars, you don't? And so I think there's basically a showdown coming, where is it going to be digital dollars built on open networks like Ethereum, or are they going to be built by the government? And I would predict that's going to be a major political discussion area in the next five years.

[01:41:56.640] - Speaker 1
There's many ways in which blockchains intersect with politics. That's one of them.

[01:42:00.800] - Speaker 2
You say currently there's difficulty for people working in the blockchain to get bank accounts. Is that based on fear? What do you think the root of that is?

[01:42:11.120] - Speaker 1
I don't know how deep down the rabbit hole you want to go here, but if you Google something called Operation Showpoint, I'll just talk about this. There's something called Operation Showpoint that happened, I think it was 10 years ago. There was accusations that the Obama administration had cut off bank accounts for people, for example, in the gun. They're political opponents. There was a series of lawsuits, and then in the discovery process of the lawsuits, it seemed as if what was happening is that various banking regulators were putting pressures on the banks. And there's a whole system that works behind the scenes where it's not public. And the Federal Reserve, the FDIC. Look, the banking system is very consolidated. So in 2008, you had the financial crisis. Then you had this thing called the Dodd-Frank Bill, which was meant to reign in the banking Banking industry. If you go to Yahoo Finance, you don't have to trust me, and look at the market caps of the top five banks, they've all gone up dramatically, and the banking industry has become much more consolidated. Then the top banks have a special guarantee from the government that they...

[01:43:13.220] - Speaker 1
I think GSIB is the word they use. It means that they're guaranteed to have their deposits insured, which is why you had this regional banking crisis with Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic and others, because they don't have that guarantee. And so this is big advantage that big banks have, which is their guarantee. So the banking, depending on who you talk to, the banking industry is just everyone is... There's all sorts of ways in which the FDIC and the Federal Reserve can punish those banks. And they have these risk scores for who your customers are. And what ends up happening as an effect is a company will get a 500-page, Hey, you're high risk. You've been flagged as high risk. You're not told why. Sometimes you're just fully debanked. We won't be your banking customer. Sometimes you're sent a 500-page questionnaire that's impossible to answer, that's a risk profile or something. But you don't get any feedback. You don't get this and that. And so it's very opaque. I'm not commenting on who's right or wrong here. I mean, it's frustrating these companies can't get bank accounts, but there's a whole separate thread of political debate around, should the executive branch have this much power?

[01:44:19.640] - Speaker 1
Should these regulators be able to decide these things, or should this happen more through a legislative democratic process? It's another question.

[01:44:27.040] - Speaker 2
You mentioned Sam Bankman-Fried earlier. I wanted to ask, what is effective altruism, and why does anyone who do it go to jail?

[01:44:37.010] - Speaker 1
I'm not an effective altruist, and I just probably just learned about it from the Internet. But I think of it as, I guess, utilitarianism, meaning that you... It's like capitalist utilitarianism or something. So you can make as much money as you want, as long as you then give it away and do it in a very rational way. That's, I don't know, like these philosophers like Peter Singer and these other people who... You give it away in a way that maximizes aggregate human utility or something like this.

[01:45:06.710] - Speaker 2
Why would that be frowned upon?

[01:45:08.370] - Speaker 1
I don't think helping people... I don't think it's that. I think it's... And again, I'm not taking it side here, but the accusation is used as a front. It's not that helping people is a bad thing. It's that there's a group of people who say that that's their goal, but then end up creating casino-like websites like FTX or lobbying to get rid of open-source software. So a lot of effective altruists have funded these think tanks that have pushed very hard to regulate AI systems. Look, I don't think... I think everyone's for maximizing human happiness and helping people. The question is, is it a fig leaf covering up another agenda, or is that the... It's also called like, effective accelerationism. So that's a movement that's a response to effective altruism, because the perception is the effective altruism people are trying to slow down the adoption of technology and are anti-open source AI. And then there's a group that call them effective accelerationists who are co-opting the name, but they're actually their opponents who are saying the only way out of our troubles in society is to actually accelerate the adoption of technology and open source. And so there's a whole...

[01:46:15.510] - Speaker 1
It's like on Twitter, you'll see E-A-C-C is effective acceleration is. It's like a thing they'll put in their Twitter handle.

[01:46:21.420] - Speaker 2
Back to the book, the computer versus the Casino.

[01:46:25.060] - Speaker 1
So as I mentioned before, I think that basically two cultures have formed around blockchains. There's a culture that is more interested in trading and speculating on the value of tokens, and in some cases, taking that and like FTX did and creating a website based in the Bahamas that lets you gamble, essentially. And then there's another culture that's the one I'm describing here, which is they're excited by using blockchains for, I think, productive use cases for creating a new generation of Internet services that are owned operated by communities instead of by companies. Tokens are an important part of the design of those systems, but they have an intended use as a productive asset in those systems as opposed to existing purely for speculative reasons. I think of it as there are two cultures, and they're battling it out in some ways to shape the narrative of this movement. I see myself as part of the computer movement. I think our side has failed in the narrative side. Most people, you walk down the street, you ask them about crypto, blockchain, chains, tokens, all these different concepts, and they'll think, oh, it's that. Either it's that silly thing like Dogecoin, it's for gambling or Bitcoin, or maybe they'll have views on Bitcoin, or they'll just say it's a bunch of scams.

[01:47:42.160] - Speaker 1
I think the fact that people say that is a failure of, partly is a failure of our communicating. It's a failure. We need to build better products where they can experience this viscerally. They need to understand what were the motivations and the reasons we're doing this. And so I think of it as, I don't know, probably true of other movements in the world, but you have people who adopt the same core things, but for different reasons. And it ends up being that I've come to the conclusion that in some ways, these Casino folks are in some ways the biggest threat to the movement. Ftx was a big... I've worked on this for a long time. That was a catastrophic incident. We were one of the few VCs who were not investors in FTX. We were not involved in any of those scandals, but it was catastrophic. And for customers who lost money, and it was very, very bad for the image of this technology. When that happened, I was depressed about it, and I said, It's really a shame. What I saw is that there's this massive gap between how I saw blockchains and how the world did.

[01:48:46.240] - Speaker 1
And at first, I was depressed about that. And then afterwards, I said, I should chin up here and see it as an opportunity, which is why then I sat down for the next 15 months and wrote this book because I was like, I want to see this as an opportunity to explain this. And the glass half full perspective, right? No, it works. How often do you get that opportunity in life to explain something that's so misunderstood? So that's what I'm trying to do. That's what I hope to do. I don't know if it'll work. I think ultimately, technology is experienced, not read about. And that's what I spend most of my time doing is helping entrepreneurs build products. And I hope that in a year or two, there'll be a bunch of products that I can build things that I can show you. Look at this musician doing this. Look at this social network. And those exist, by the way, and they're growing, but they're early still. They're not mainstream.

[01:49:32.170] - Speaker 2
Most of my understanding up until reading your book was the idea of it being like a replacement for gold, an alternative currency that protects value. The book is so powerful because it presents a whole other use case that I don't think anyone knows about.

[01:49:49.380] - Speaker 1
It was a very hard book to write because it's a book about network design, really. And so I was like, how do I make this tangible? And so I spent a ton of time I mean, yeah, just try, as you hopefully saw, telling stories, giving examples. I did a rewrite at one point where a friend of mine told me to remove every adverb and adjectif from the book because I would When you're writing about abstract things, it's easy to use, I would say, genuine ownership. What does that mean? And so instead, remove it and then add five sentences that give examples. So I just kept doing that over and over and over. And it's really nice to hear it just because you sit in a room and do that and you're like, I think it's more accessible, but I have no idea until someone actually reads it. So I was excited to see that you found it understandable.

[01:50:42.610] - Speaker 2
No, it spoke to me right away. And I'm not, as I said, not a technical person.

[01:50:47.200] - Speaker 1
That's great to hear. Thank you.

[01:50:48.210] - Speaker 2
The next section of the book is called The iPhone Moment: From Incubation to Growth.

[01:50:53.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So I spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about technology history. And Specifically computing history. And I think computing history... I think it was part of my job and just my interest is to try to predict the future. And I think the best guide for predicting the future is in many ways the past, because the world is incredibly complex and many different things intersecting, and the past reveals patterns that sometimes recur. And specifically with computing, I think you have these repeatable patterns. First of all, you have There's two major phases for computing movement. The early phase is the incubation phase. And that's Steve Jobs and Wozniak that went to the Home Brew Computer Club and flip flops, and they hand-assembled PCs. That was, I think 1979. And it wasn't until probably six or seven years later that PCs started to grow and get popular. And then mobile phones. Mobile phone, there's a great documentary. It's on the company called General I think they were 1994 or '95, and they were trying to create an iPhone, essentially. So that was 12 years before the iPhone. And in fact, it's funny because there were a lot of the same people like Tony Fidel and others who did create the iPhone, but they were 12 years too early.

[01:52:15.290] - Speaker 1
And then, for those who remember, I had a sidekick. I love the sidekick. It was this mobile phone that had this flip thing. It was like the early 2000s. And then the iPhone came out. But if you look at the stats, and there was this Blackbird before that, too. If you look at the stats, it essentially Essentially, there was some usage, a couple of million people, but then it just boom, hockey stick with the iPhone. Same with the PC. Pc, there was some usage, this and that. Maybe a million people had computers in the early '80s or something, but then it just hit and boom like this, right? Ai has been around for 80 years. The first paper on neural networks was in 1943. Long history in AI. There was actually an AI bubble, financial bubble in the 1980s, believe it or not. Wow. Yeah, it was this thing called Expert Systems, and there are all these companies going public and talk to AI veterans. They'll talk about all these different... They call them summers and winters or summers when there was funding and people were excited, and then they'd get depressed, and there would be a 10-year bleak period.

[01:53:15.390] - Speaker 1
80 years. And then you have ChatGPT, and now probably AI is off to the races and going to grow in the same way the iPhone did in 2007. And so I think every computing movement follows this pattern. And you have this moment where where the right product is built. That right moment... In computing, it's different than maybe in music or some other creative thing. You're dependent on other things. Why did AI happen now? Openai is a brilliant company, brilliant people. But fundamentally, it's because the neural networks can be much bigger than they were in the past, because the processors they use, the GPUs made by companies like Nvidia, have just gotten much, much better, which has followed this thing, Mohr's law, which is this long term process that's happened in the computing industry, where you can pack more transistors on a computer. So in computing, the big difference is it's not like one person doing it. There's all of these different forces where you can look at these trend lines. And by the way, why did GPUs get better? Video games, very It's very strange. If we ever have AGI, ultra sophisticated AI, it was bootstrap by video game.

[01:54:22.260] - Speaker 1
People playing Fortnite is what funded GPUs. Gpus suddenly got so good that you could then run LLMs on them. And so all computing follows this pattern. So I work on blockchains, and blockchains are computers, but they have all sorts of weaknesses, like early smartphones. So for example, I talked a lot about Ethereum, but the problem with Ethereum is if you go and you do some action, it can cost you a dollar. It's too expensive, and it can be slow sometimes. And sometimes if you go to some of these applications, like the user experience, there's a pop-up in this like this, and it's just confusing. And it's very much like old mobile phones before the iPhone. The experience wasn't quite there. And so I think a lot about, as I have throughout my career, where are we in this cycle, and when will it happen, and what investments and other things can I do to accelerate that process? So that's what the iPhone. The iPhone moment is my shorthand way of saying, all computing movements follow some predictable process. And then in all cases, if they're successful, there's a moment where it all comes together and the world says, Aha, I get it.

[01:55:25.550] - Speaker 2
Based on what you've seen so far, what would you say the best... What's What's the best use case you've seen thus far for a blockchain computer?

[01:55:37.030] - Speaker 1
I think the thing we talked about earlier, like digital dollars around the world, is a pretty... I mean, that's actually the most popular use case, and that's many hundreds of billions a month. It's really actually popular. I think we take it for granted in the US, that you have access to dollars. You can't take it for granted around the world. And that's valuable. And I think it should be... I go to DC a lot, and we argue it should be in the US's interest. It makes the dollar more popular. The dollar, in some ways, it's really the most popular product in the world. And it's one of the reasons the US is so successful. And blockchains make it easier to use them and to access them.

[01:56:12.270] - Speaker 2
Let's use another one besides that. That gives it the casino feeling.

[01:56:17.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So we haven't talked about NFTs. So NFTs are tokens that are one of one token. So instead of being... So something like Bitcoin is what's called fungible. So if you have one Bitcoin, it's like money. It's like they're interchangeable. If I have a Bitcoin, you have a Bitcoin, it doesn't matter which one. Nfts is just a concept of a unique token that represents something. People think of NFTs as representing an avatar, like a photo. That doesn't have to be. It can represent your social media name. It can represent your audience. It can represent It can represent health care data. It can represent... It's just a thing you own on the Internet. I just think for me, things like social networks and games, if you look at the seven hours a day people spend on the Internet, three to four hours is social networking and games and messaging. So they just have to be important things. If you're going to try to work on something that fights the consolidation and concentration of the Internet, you have to take those categories seriously. So a lot of things around that. I think things around before I talked about video games and virtual goods and buying skins and things.

[01:57:16.920] - Speaker 1
I think that there's a lot of really interesting ways in which you can think about similar models for other forms of media. We see musicians selling digital merchandise and backstage passes as blockchain items, right? And so they are able to When they do that, they can bypass the labels and Spotify and build direct relationship with their audiences. So you buy NFT as a musician, and you show that you're an early fan, and you get to go to see the special behind-the-scene show. And people are doing things where there's offline, online interactions where the NFT becomes a ticket. And the interesting thing there, again, is removing the gatekeepers, and they can invent whatever creative thing they want. And then there's, like I mentioned before, the collaborative storytelling. New business models for creative people, I think, are going to become very It's really important. And by the way, all these things I'm discussing, the collaboratives, we have two investments that are doing that, and they have products, and these are real things. They're early. They're not... They're tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands of users. Remember, the Internet is now 5 billion people. So we have many companies that are blockchain-based with millions of users, but they aren't at billions of users, which is what people expect now for mainstream.

[01:58:23.390] - Speaker 1
So these are all things that exist, just so you know, and people are using. So I think anywhere where you currently have these kinds of big gatekeepers in games, social media, media businesses, those are all interesting. By the way, in the book, at the end, I have seven sections where there's specific application areas. Finance is interesting, and this is not the speculative side of finance, things like payments. So payments today, every payment you do in the world, there's a two and a half % fee that's associated with it. One of the interesting things with blockchain-based payments is you can have a direct payment without having to have all those intermediaries and charge fees. That also allows you to do things like people have talked about for years, like machine-to-machine payments. So one investment we have is if you want to train an AI model, today, the only people that can train big AI models are giant companies. So Facebook just bought, I think it was 100,000 GPUs for $10 billion. How does a startup compete with that? So we have an investment. It's called Jensen. And Jensen, think of it almost like Airbnb for GPUs.

[01:59:28.430] - Speaker 1
So there's all these gamers in the world who have GPUs. I now, as a startup, can submit a job. I want to train this AI model. I submit it to this system, and the system then says to all the people with GPUs, Hey, if you'll run a little bit of code, you can get paid money. And then this allows the startup to compete on the level playing field. Access to that network. Yeah, in the same way that Airbnb... And the way Airbnb uses underutilized, I'm away for two weeks, why not sell it? I have a graphics card for gaming, but I'm Why not playing it right now? Why not sell that GPU time? So that's a machine-to-machine payment. So there's all these ways in which you can use blockchain-based payments to create networks that allow startups to compete on a level playing field with big companies. Another interesting one is deep fakes. So deep fakes are AI-generated video that fakes like a politician said something they didn't say. There's people building interesting blockchain-based systems where one of the things blockchains are very good at is proving provenance. It's proving where something came from. And by the way, you're also going to need systems to prove people are real.

[02:00:35.290] - Speaker 1
There's a whole bunch of people working on a thing called proof of person. So I can prove cryptographically that I'm a real person, and I get a code, and there's a whole way to do that. And then I have a code that says, I'm Chris Dixon, I'm a real person. When I send you an email, you can know that email came from a person and not AI, because AI can now... Think about it, up until now, you've just detected it based on the text. That's not going to work anymore in the AI world. And then, moreover, I can say, I'm Chris I'm Dixon, and I attest that I created this video, or I'm the New York Times, and I attest this is a real video, or I'm Joe Biden, and I say this is a real video. And so you have a provenance trail. And I think this is going to be just absolutely necessary. It's probably necessary today, but certainly in five years, to have an internet where you trust that these things are real. That system will get created. It will have to get created. That system that says, I'm a real person, that this is a real video, someone will create that.

[02:01:25.830] - Speaker 1
We're not going to live in a world of awash with fake video. The question becomes, problems. In all cases, I believe, is that created by Facebook, or is it created by a community-owned system, i. E, a blockchain? Shouldn't that information, your proof of personhood, exist on a community-owned database, not on a corporate-owned database? So I view it as AI is coming, metaverses are coming. There's a whole new way. Remember, the Internet is 30 years into its development. It sounds maybe hyperbolic, but I think it's credible to think the Internet is as important as the printing press and a bunch of other massive technologies. We are very, very early. There's going to be many, many more systems built on the Internet. And the choice we have is basically, are they going to be systems that are owned by those five companies? Because there's going to be a proof of person, though. There's going to be a proof that the video is real. Or is it going to be built in this open, community-owned way, which is what a blockchain... I'm one another way to think about a blockchain is a community on database that it can also run code and do other things like a computer.

[02:02:24.690] - Speaker 1
But the point is it's owned by a community. You can store that on the Ethereum blockchain that you're a real person There's actually a project called World Coin that actually we're investors in. And Sam Altman from Over the eye is the co founder of, which is a company doing exactly what I describe, the proof of personhood thing. And it stores a record on the Ethereum blockchain. And I keep a private key where I can say, Hey, I'm that person, and I prove I'm that person.

[02:02:45.330] - Speaker 2
And I suppose venture capital fits in to help the individual compete with the big corporation with all the funding that they need.

[02:02:56.550] - Speaker 1
Yes. I think the only reason that startups have... I mean, look, I mean, people will tell you different things about venture capital. I work in venture capital. I'm pro venture capital. I mean, there's obviously good and bad examples of it like any industry. But I think at its best, it's a resource that lets startups compete with big companies, right? And on a somewhat level playing field. It's not fully level, but somewhat. I mean, the biggest event, even if we give somebody $10 or $100 million, they still have far less than Google, but they also just have the energy and bigger of a startup. But yeah, I think it does play an important role to help them compete. We like to say When we go to DC, we represent little tech, not big tech, because people say, Aren't you just saying this to further your interest? We're like, Yeah, we are. But our interests are startups, dynamic economy, dynamic Internet. So that is in our interest. It is self I'm interested, but I would also argue that that's generally in the world's interest as well, to have a dynamic open Internet. We're pro-open-source software, we're pro-open-source AI, we're pro-blockchains.

[02:03:54.670] - Speaker 1
We want to see a big dynamic open Internet, right? And that does benefit us, but I I argue, benefits the world. It just so happens we're aligned with the world in this way.

[02:04:04.340] - Speaker 2
Tell me, what was the cause for Optimism? It's the conclusion of the book.

[02:04:09.290] - Speaker 1
Well, the book was written as a general audience explainer. One question, you When you write a book, is if you actually look at book sales figures, compared to internet products, like blogs and things, not that many people read. You can write a blog post that gets read by a lot more people than a book. And so when you write a book, you have to ask... You wrote a book, you probably asked yourself this, but why Why am I writing a book as opposed to a blog post or a podcast or something like this? And I've had a number of books in my life that have really had a profound impact. And so when I wrote the book, a lot of it, I was thinking about people early in their career and what are they thinking about doing. And so that last section, Cause for Optimism, is a little bit more of a manifesto, and it's hoping to inspire some of the readers, especially people maybe that are building stuff. There's various powerful forces in the technology industry that I think are put wind at the back of this movement. One of them is just the fact that the infrastructure and all the core technology has been on a steady improvement course over the last decade and continues to improve.

[02:05:08.200] - Speaker 1
And as that improve, talking about the iPhone moment, you get to a point where it's just good enough to build great products. Another is that there's a natural network effect. The more people that use blockchains, the more valuable they get because they're fundamentally social technology. And I ended with this thinking about... I always, as a fan of history, like to think about the early days of people tinkering on computer systems. And there's two ways to look at that. When you look at the early Google founders, the early Wozniak and jobs, one is, wow, they got a lot of work to do. That's a really nascent industry. And the other is, those are the good old days. That's the fun tinkering times. And so that's how I end the book, because I'm saying, these are the good old days of blockchain. So hopefully someday, 30 years from now, people will be talking about this important technology that is used by billions of people. And The people now who are misunderstood and maybe mischaracterized are actually going to be the tinkers that led to that movement. I think it's hopefully an exciting time for them.

[02:06:13.000] - Speaker 2
I think the good news is that for the typical user, it'll be the same experience. They won't necessarily know that the thing that they're working on is blockchain-related. So if something great comes along and it happens to be on the blockchain, that would really open the doors.

[02:06:27.870] - Speaker 1
I think the one thing that they may notice different is what I was saying before, the ability to switch. In the same way, you may not know the details, but you understand the web is different. I can download Chrome or I can download Safari. It's the service is independent of the software. That will be the difference. But I think you're right. Otherwise, it should be identical and feel just as modern and advanced.

[02:06:51.060] - Speaker 2
If you were going to start today building anything, is there any reason not to build on a blockchain?

[02:06:57.040] - Speaker 1
Yes. There's always a cost to building on a blockchain because there's this game theoretic mechanism I described before that keeps a bunch of different computers that may not trust each other, collectively honest. And that's what's called a consensus mechanism, and that has some overhead. So if you're doing some very high performance thing, like a Grand Theft Auto. You don't want to run Grand Theft Auto on a blockchain. It's going to be impossible or something that's highly performant like that. Generally, what you want to store on a blockchain are the things that shift power to the users. If it's finance, it's like the user controls their money. If it's social network, the user controls their name and their data and their audience. So that's how I think about it. It's like there's a cost to it. You want to put just enough to shift the power to the users. But outside of that, you just let computers do the regular thing.

[02:07:46.160] - Speaker 2
And it sounds like the cost to it has a benefit that's really worth the cost.

[02:07:50.230] - Speaker 1
I think so. And the benefit is that the user controls that aspect. The end user, the little person, not the company, controls that aspect of the service. And so it's a way to shift power and money back to the edges of the network.

[02:08:02.700] - Speaker 2
So it's also possible that in the way that Linux took over, there could be this open version of the web going forward based on blockchain.

[02:08:12.980] - Speaker 1
I think so. I hope so. In the chapter on community-created software, what I say is the Cathedral and the Bazaar, which was referring to the '90s battle over operating systems. I see blockchains versus centralized services like Facebook as today's Cathedral and the Bazaar. Blockchains are the Bazaar, and these centralized gatekeepers are the cathedral. And I think ultimately, communities and markets and bottoms up processes, they're chaotic, and they take more time, and they create this casino culture and all the controversy and everything else. But in the end, I think bottom up communities are a very powerful force and can ultimately be better and win out over these cathedral centralized services. Centralized services.
