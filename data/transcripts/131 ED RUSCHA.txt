[00:00:25.060] - Speaker 1
I came in here in '56. '56. Right after high school. I identified with Grapes of Wrath a little bit because I came from Oklahoma. Bible built, Jim Crow laws and all that. But we had a little bit of a progressive introduction to world of music through Clyde McFadder and Lieber Stoler and those people that are going to need an ocean of calamine lotion.

[00:01:00.660] - Speaker 2
It's like prototype rock and roll,. Yeah.

[00:01:04.820] - Speaker 1
What do they say? Rocket 88, Jackie Branson.

[00:01:09.100] - Speaker 2
They say Rocket 88 was the very first rock record. I don't know if it's true, but it's interesting.

[00:01:14.380] - Speaker 1
I don't either, But I take it as what a lot of people think. But we listen to music like that, and it was a little bit dark, and parents didn't like us for that classic parent-child growing up type thing. Then I wanted to leave and go to someplace where I could go to an art school. I thought about New York or Chicago, Kansas City, maybe. Or LA. I picked this because I had visited here before, and New York, too cold. Chicago, too cold. I like the idea of palm trees and this life.

[00:02:02.760] - Speaker 2
It was a bold choice because really, most artists at that time or someone even with a dream of a career in art or a work in art would probably go to New York, don't you think? Yeah.

[00:02:14.260] - Speaker 1
Then a lot of People had the idea that if you're going to be an artist, you can do something commercial so you can make a living at it. And then there's Hallmark Cards in Kansas City. So Kansas City Art Institute welcomed a lot of people like that.

[00:02:29.540] - Speaker 2
We're also started as a commercial artist.

[00:02:31.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. He was an accomplished commercial artist before he got into painting. And he was an exceptional person for that. But New New York, a lot was happening back there in the '50s with the abstract expressionists and de Kooning and Franz Klein and all these people, Adolf Gottlieb.

[00:02:55.640] - Speaker 2
At the time that you were moving out here, that was still happening in New York?

[00:03:00.000] - Speaker 1
It was still happening, yeah. We got drift to that in our art school. I thought I wanted to be a sign painter. I went to enroll in ArtCenter School over on Third Street. And their quotas were all filled. I took the second best, and I went to Chénard, which was better for me. Artcenter had a dress code. You couldn't wear any affectation of a Beatnik. You couldn't wear-Facial hair. You could facial hair of any kind. No good. You couldn't take a Bongo drum to school.

[00:03:39.160] - Speaker 2
It's funny for an art school, right?

[00:03:40.480] - Speaker 1
Well, it is. Totally. I mean, it's much different today than it was back then. But they actually said, You can't wear sandals to school, and you can't wear a beret. It was a commercial school. But then, Chénard, on the other hand, was totally opposite that. You could dress and act like you I wanted to and get away with everything.

[00:04:02.140] - Speaker 2
What was the experience of art school at that point in time?

[00:04:05.640] - Speaker 1
Well, I was in advertising design classes and general design classes and painting classes and drawing and Then they had another class called Visual World, studying the eye and everything that that means. I was lucky enough to be with a bunch of students who I jived with. We We inspired each other. Actually, it even got to the point of being competitive, and that was okay. We had good instructors, too. We had Robert Irwin and Billy L. Bankston, John L. Toon, and Emerson Wolfs was a good teacher. And so these teachers just... We got into this whole thing about abstract expressionism and painting on a canvas that's blank, face to blank canvas with colors and brushes. And so we all worked towards that. And then I got out of feeling like I wanted to be in commercial art and I wanted to be in fine arts and painting and that thing. I don't know, make crazy pictures that are preconceived. I'd had an idea in my head before I started it rather than facing a blank canvas.

[00:05:31.440] - Speaker 2
Has it always been that way for you? It's always preconceived and then you execute it?

[00:05:35.850] - Speaker 1
Pretty much, yeah. But other things will sneak in, too. Whatever the circumstance of the moment is can influence me, too.

[00:05:46.760] - Speaker 2
From your initial imagination to the finished piece, how different might it be?

[00:05:53.740] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes it's surprisingly different, but mostly I follow a course. Sometimes that is just spontaneous and look at the world and the contents of the world and everything that's happening in it, and then just pittle with it, just mess with the stuff that they give us.

[00:06:14.700] - Speaker 2
Can you think of a specific example of working on something and it changing?

[00:06:20.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think early on when I was in school, I lived on spam for a while, and I love the lettering on spam. I had a personal connection to this. The can, the shape of the can, it had a weird little thing. You don't see too many products being sold in that rounded corner metal containers anymore. I don't think you see that much. I don't think so. It's all plastic. Something told me, You got to make a picture out of this. I painted that real big, like 6 feet across. The logo? Yeah, spam. Things like that that I felt like were things that I experienced just in everyday life. That's my subject matter. It's been like that. Off and on, go zigzag this way and that way.

[00:07:17.900] - Speaker 2
You come in contact with a lot of stuff over the course of your life. What makes the one, this is the thing that's going to be the painting? What's the spark that you recognize?

[00:07:32.780] - Speaker 1
A lot of times it's just a notion that comes from the sky or from the ground or from somewhere, you wonder where it is, and then you just take it with blind faith and carry on through with it. And I found that to be true with a lot of my work is that I get a notion or something pulls at me, and then I go at it that way. I mean, I don't don't have a game plan or a method, particularly. And it's mysterious phenomenon, this creating things.

[00:08:13.020] - Speaker 2
You have a notion that something's going to be interesting, then you decide to engage with it. How do you pick the materials to use, for example?

[00:08:22.780] - Speaker 1
A lot of it is habit. The fact that paint seems to be okay as a source, as a material to use and print making okay, the same thing, a piece of charcoal, pencil. These are established things, and I got onto them real early, and they don't seem to have changed that much. But there is a lot of things that are happening in the art world now that they're using computers, and they're doing all kinds of insane things that I'm not ready to step up to.

[00:08:59.560] - Speaker 2
I If it's not broken, you don't need to fix it.

[00:09:02.240] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the Farris Gallery.

[00:09:05.680] - Speaker 2
What was that like?

[00:09:06.820] - Speaker 1
It was really an astounding group of artists that got together under the guise of one man named Walter Hopps. We all call him Chico. And he created this gallery and got a space over on La Cienega.

[00:09:24.240] - Speaker 2
It was a storefront?

[00:09:25.250] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And the place is still there, but not the gallery. Yeah. But it was, I think, back in the '50s or '60s, they had to come up with $50 a month rent. But they had a complete lineup of really great artists. And they showed Andy Warhol's first exhibit of Campbell's soup cans, those. And then they had Georgio Morandi paintings there, and they had Kurt Schwitter's German Dottest artist that made little collages from train receipts that he'd find on the floor.

[00:10:05.460] - Speaker 2
I didn't know they had Morandi. I thought of them more as American artists.

[00:10:10.940] - Speaker 1
They were. I mean, it was. But they also had an appreciation for people like that.

[00:10:17.150] - Speaker 2
That's amazing.

[00:10:18.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Really pretty interesting lineup. And a lot of contemporary artists at the time, like Billy Al Bengston and John Altoon, Robert Irwin, Ed Moses, Craig Kaufman, Ken Price. And a lot of that interwove with surfing and the beach lifestyle. And most of these artists were living in Venice. I was mostly in Hollywood on Western Avenue about that time, but I lived in Echo Park and around there. So I never really got out to Venice until later on. And I had a studio out there. But anyway, Farris, it was a hotspot Then Monday night was the openings. People would flock to Farris.

[00:11:06.680] - Speaker 2
To have one every Monday?

[00:11:08.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah, every Monday night. You'd walk from gallery to gallery on La Cienica, and then up the street, and you'd go to Barney's Beanery. So people would hang out there. Ed Keenholtz was another artist. He was one of the first artists that showed there and that actually created that gallery. So he was one of the owners of the gallery. Wally Bermon.

[00:11:33.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Did you know him?

[00:11:35.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:11:35.820] - Speaker 2
He was a good friend.

[00:11:36.720] - Speaker 1
He was great. He was a fan. I just saw his son, Tosh, the other night. Who was that tall when I met Wally. But did you ever know him?

[00:11:47.320] - Speaker 2
No, I'm just a fan of the work.

[00:11:49.110] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Then there a little bit of the cinema world got involved in it. Dennis Hopper was one of the first people to come around and actually buy buy works from the gallery, and he bought my first painting. The first painting you ever sold was to him.

[00:12:06.280] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:12:06.820] - Speaker 1
Great. I mean, there's quite a few people from the movie business, but I was always surprised that there weren't more people in the movie business that were interested in art. Vincent Price, he was an art collector, and he had a real good taste and all that. So did Edward G. Robinson, people like that. But they didn't touch young artists. Russ Tamblin was another artist. I still see. I went to his 90th birthday party the other day. Amazing. Yeah. I reminded him that I watched him on a... It was an academy award presentation or something, and he was at one end of the stage, and he did a cartwheel, cartwheel, cartwheel, cartwheel, cartwheel split like this. I just couldn't believe it. And he must have been 70 years old when he did that. Amazing. To be able to do that. But he was a great dancer. Anyway, he was one of those people that was under the sphere of Wally Bermond. George Herms was another artist that was right there, and he's still alive.

[00:13:22.700] - Speaker 2
On the Monday nights when you would go, would you say it was mostly artists?

[00:13:28.220] - Speaker 1
It was a lot of people interested in the scene, and a lot of these people, they might end up buying art. I mean, if it was over $50, forget it. They were not interested in it. And there was another actor named Sterling Hollowway. Yeah. He was a supporter of the Farris, and he would buy things from there. And then there's Don Picardi and Christopher Isherwood, the writer, and they would always come around. Cool. So they were part of the scene. And it was a lively bunch of people. They all had their individual voices. Each one of them had their own unique thing. They were not really, you couldn't say, They're all work all looks like, because it didn't. No. Each one was entirely different.

[00:14:21.510] - Speaker 2
Even when you describe them, it's interesting imagining them all hanging out together because I think of them in different ways. Yeah.

[00:14:30.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:14:30.720] - Speaker 2
Would you say in the whole scene, were there a few hundred people or a few thousand people at that time?

[00:14:38.480] - Speaker 1
I would say a few hundred people, to be safe.

[00:14:41.580] - Speaker 2
It's a small local scene.

[00:14:43.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was. It was small, local, but people knew about it. People from New York knew that whatever has happened in LA, it's really going to be maybe the fairest gallery.

[00:14:54.940] - Speaker 2
That's interesting. How do you think they knew?

[00:14:57.080] - Speaker 1
I guess our world is such a small entity that were just spread in little ways, but they knew what was happening. Then a man named Irving Blum, who's still alive, he was partnered with Walter Hobbes, and Irving took the gallery over eventually. Walter went on to be the director of the Smithsonian and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington. Anyway, and then the international scene opened up when Marcel Duchamp had his first gallery show in his life. He was like 65 years old, and Walter Hopps gave him this show at the Pasadena Art Museum. So that was a big thing. And all the artists went there. It was really a notable event in the art world.

[00:15:51.340] - Speaker 2
Do you think if Walter Hopps didn't do that Duchamp show when Duchamp was 65, maybe our perception of Duchamp might have been different now?

[00:16:04.040] - Speaker 1
I think so. It was eventually going to happen no matter what. And so if Walter hadn't done it, someone else would have a big museum. Maybe a lot of his work is owned by the Philadelphia Museum. But he's highly respected and a real curious phenomenon to anybody who makes art. A lot of people don't like him because he didn't paint pretty pictures.

[00:16:32.600] - Speaker 2
Do you feel like the movement that you were part of was the movement after abstract expressionism?

[00:16:42.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, there were urgings and things brewing underneath the whole abstract expression is, boy, those guys were really painted beautiful pictures, but there was almost like no room to move around them because that's all covered. All these things or these statements that they're making with paint and shapes and all this are so well done by them. Why add to the whole thing? It went to the opposite side, which is it leaked into the world of popular culture. People were beginning to say, Well, maybe the Coca-Cola bottle is not such a bad thing after all. It's a very known thing, and so let's make something of it. Duchamp also said that, too. He was saying, Look around. There's a lot to see. You might be overlooking the valuable things.

[00:17:44.440] - Speaker 2
What do you think the first piece of art you ever saw that could be considered pop art?

[00:17:51.500] - Speaker 1
Let me see. I'll show you. This is the first thing that got me. That's about the the actual size of that work. It's a pen and ink drawing by an unknown artist named Johannes Bargild, who was a German Dottest, 1920, and that's called Beatles. I saw that thing almost like the size of a postage stamp in a book, and I thought, wow, it just blew me away. It was so curious. I mean, it looked like, what is that? Horses at a starting gate or what is it? Almost looked like a science experiment or not meant to be perceived as art, and that's what I liked about it. So it had a real power to it.

[00:18:45.720] - Speaker 2
What year did you see this?

[00:18:47.480] - Speaker 1
I saw that about 1969, 1960. Yeah. Yeah. 1959, 1960. That was made in 1920. I wanted to see that thing in in the raw. So I went to the Museum of Modern Art on my first trip to New York, and I made a cold call to the Department of Drawings and just told them I wanted to see that. And they said, Come on up. They bring this work out and show it to me. And I felt like, this is like I've got an audience with the Pope. Yeah.

[00:19:23.560] - Speaker 2
What else did you see on that trip?

[00:19:26.260] - Speaker 1
I saw a lot of... I mean, that was my first trip to New York, so I'd never been there before. Then I went to Europe after that for about six months. Mostly, I saw American art in Europe. I didn't get too inspired by what European artists were doing, even contemporary artists. I didn't see too many that I really liked. So work like this really had a powerful effect on me. And also Jasper John's work, he painted Target. And then he had these ceramic faces called Target and Four Faces with these things like this with a little flap that comes down, like a little doorway that comes up. I thought, wow, that's another one of these things that is so puzzling. I won't even bother to figure that out why I like it, but I do.

[00:20:26.500] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that feeling of mystery. Yeah. Is that what it's all about?

[00:20:32.020] - Speaker 1
Unexplained. Yeah.

[00:20:35.920] - Speaker 2
What's the first time you saw any work with type in it?

[00:20:41.520] - Speaker 1
Maybe Picasso painted things like that, and the French Surrealist did. And also Jasper John's painted that way, too. So I got pretty moved by that type of work. And I was Also, I liked printing and setting type. I learned how to do that. I worked for a printer and ran the presses. I learned how to set type and do that. And then that became esthetic to me. It began to really influenced me. I made some books from that. And then the idea of making a book into... I mean, why can't a book be considered an artwork?

[00:21:26.580] - Speaker 2
That was a new idea when you had it.

[00:21:28.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah, it's just piling on of all this stuff. You just give your soul to the school and to all your friends. And then every day that you get up and go to school, then every day that you make art, something new is coming into the scene, and you'd be keeping up with what's going on in the neighborhood, Farris Gallery and all the other galleries, too. There were a lot of them. And then there were people who were living out in the sticks. It's like Bruce Nauman was beginning to show his work there, and Joe Good was showing his work. And so it was like a vital period.

[00:22:15.580] - Speaker 2
Do you think that feeling of community was necessary for you? If you would have come and there were no other artists and you were just by yourself, would it have happened?

[00:22:26.470] - Speaker 1
Or is it having a group of people, I want to say, like-minded, even with different ideas, but some thread of going out into the new world? I can't imagine doing the thing by myself, but maybe I encountered something in your book that you also said, but in a different way, which is all art comes out of other art. And so originality is a vague term, total originality. I mean, people come along and they're phenomenal, but they're not absolutely immune to trying to understand the world or something.

[00:23:15.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And all of the information we have is stuff we've taken in over the course of our life. We don't come in filled with ideas or pictures. We come in empty, and then we go through life and see things and fill up this storage.

[00:23:32.720] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But I guess it's fortunate that we can have opinions about things because otherwise, you wouldn't have things you don't like. And so I would have things that I don't like, and I don't like that. And yet that would influence me, too. So it all comes together to make up who you are. So I see a lot of people have funny feelings about the art world where they think it's all conspiratorial or something. Only the people who work hard at it or they don't even have to have that much talent to make a life out of it. But I see too much like young artists today or they're like Kamikaze. They're this crash and burn. They're making great works, but they're out there. And there are younger people who are Really pushing it forward. So it's good to see. Music, same way.

[00:24:37.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's always changing, always moving. I can't say it's always better, but there are always new interesting things. I think in the past, it was more curated because it was harder to put stuff out. So less stuff came out. Tom Petty would say, In the 1960s, if you played on a record, you had to be good. You wouldn't to play on a record if you weren't really good. Everybody was good.

[00:25:04.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:25:05.020] - Speaker 2
Now the entry level is lower, so anyone can do it. But from that, really interesting things can happen. Yeah, sure. I want to ask you about the picture without words that you have at the Getty.

[00:25:18.360] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:19.580] - Speaker 2
Did you create that piece to live in that space?

[00:25:23.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I took careful measurements. They gave me this commission to do that, saying, There's a wall, do something to it. It's a big wall. Yeah. It's like 30 feet high, basically.

[00:25:39.290] - Speaker 2
Maybe 40. It's very tall. Yeah.

[00:25:41.700] - Speaker 1
It's about 15, 20 feet wide or something. I conceived of this thing that I thought would be really good for an auditorium, light streaming in from somewhere and smashing the floor, making a mark on the floor. It was a big project. We put together these aluminum aircraft skins together to make up this 30 by 15 foot surface to stretch canvas on. So it was very heavy. And I had to work on the studio I had in Venice. And I did a time study on it because light was coming in continuously throughout the day, and it would blast on the wall and go down like this. And so we did a time study with natural sunlight. And that was a technique that they had invented at the General Motors Company, I think. To what? To study automobile paints. They have a way of doing a time study on something. They can tell you how much damage or how much light is going to happen over 150 years of time. Wow. They ran this over there. It taught me a lot, I guess, but then I didn't want it to interfere with my idea. I don't know.

[00:27:17.800] - Speaker 1
I mean, that painting is about 25 years old now, and I don't see anything changed about it at all.

[00:27:26.660] - Speaker 2
When you describe the picture without words, you talk about the light coming in and smashing the floor. When I see the image, I see the light. To me, the feature of the painting is the light. Yes, there's an opening that it's coming in through at the top. Yes, there's a place it's landing on the bottom. But the feature of it is the light. It's interesting to hear you describe it as there's an opening and where it lands.

[00:27:56.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Then a painting of That magnitude size was a little tricky. I had a studio in Venice that had a 30-foot ceiling, but this painting would not quite fit that. So I painted it on its side, and I was always looking like this. I've got a picture of my son, Eddie, and we're both looking at a painting like this.

[00:28:24.900] - Speaker 2
Was the first time you saw it upright in the museum?

[00:28:27.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:28:28.360] - Speaker 2
Was there ever a consideration to Did you paint it there or was that not possible?

[00:28:32.140] - Speaker 1
No, it wasn't possible. I mean, someone would have come out of the woodwork and done something. Yes, they would have used that and painted on the wall, but I couldn't see doing it that way. I wanted a mobile something I could paint off-site and then install. It just made better sense.

[00:28:53.300] - Speaker 2
Did you ever consider painting it in a way that you could take it apart and put it together?

[00:28:57.620] - Speaker 1
You make multiple parts?

[00:29:00.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah, if it was in four pieces that came together.

[00:29:03.780] - Speaker 1
I thought about that, but I didn't like those joints. Yeah. It had to be in one piece, so that's the way it got to be. It was painted on its side, yeah. I had a cot that I was always looking at it. I just laid down on this cot. Then to install it was, I luckily had a fabricator, Ron McPherson, who really knew how to... He prepared the canvas for me and put it on this aluminum aircraft skin with armature behind it and a frame and everything. Then To move it, it took two forklift trucks to get it in place. And then somehow they had a complicated setup of bolts that held this thing in place. Boy, you You have to have some fabricator with ideas to know how to pull something like that off. That's why I always admire artists who make giant things in factories and with fabricators and Jeff Coons, a lot of people don't like his work, but if they looked at the fabrication of his work, it is top, top quality.

[00:30:24.800] - Speaker 2
The detail is unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Tell me how size of an image impacts it. What's the difference between the same image big versus small?

[00:30:35.820] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I always had... I mean, even working a size like this, I would get into a habit for convenience and just the physicality of it I like little works. Even I get works that were tiny like this. I like tiny things, too. Every time I approach a work that I think I want to make, something pushes me in the direction of size. I'll say that'll work better if it's just like half size rather than 6 feet by 8 feet.

[00:31:11.400] - Speaker 2
And just an inner knowing?

[00:31:13.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Or Something says, How am I going to learn from this thing unless it overpower me? I want a wall rocket. And then that makes it become itself.

[00:31:27.300] - Speaker 2
How is it different making a piece like the example in the Getty, to live in a certain place versus a piece that's going to just be shown where it's going to be shown. Is that different?

[00:31:38.800] - Speaker 1
Well, I pretty much was guaranteed that that's going to stay there for a while. Yeah.

[00:31:45.770] - Speaker 2
But I'm saying if you're asked to paint a picture that's going to live in one place forever, it doesn't have to be that size. If you know where it's going to live, does that change it?

[00:31:58.840] - Speaker 1
Not in the making of it. There are not many works of art I make that I ever have any notion of where that thing is going to end up.

[00:32:07.450] - Speaker 2
So usually it's going to go where it's going to go. Yeah.

[00:32:10.960] - Speaker 1
But I've worked on commissions, too, where I did a library in Miami in 1985 that involved 60 paintings that were like 6 feet by 12 feet, and then a circular rotunda about six Let's see. Words without thoughts, never to heaven go. That's seven words from Hamlet. I painted one word on each one, and it was joined together. Each one was joined and painted on aluminum with canvas mounted to aluminum. Then we would bend it into place in this circular opening. Sometimes the colors would jar with each other and they wouldn't continue on. It wouldn't continue. So that's an example of somewhere I knew where these things were going to go, and they're now in place. Now, that building was brand new, designed by Philip Johnson. And now they're thinking about, well, it's lived its life. What's going to happen with my artwork? And I go back and look at the contract, and it doesn't really cover me on anything.

[00:33:27.960] - Speaker 2
It's not protected.

[00:33:28.540] - Speaker 1
I wonder, What's going to What would happen to that? I mean, it'd be nice if they gave me those back. But I don't know what they're going to do.

[00:33:35.240] - Speaker 2
Well, maybe a museum would buy it and build an installation. Something. I don't think it'll just go away. How important are the words you use?

[00:33:47.060] - Speaker 1
They've got to have some temperature to them or anonymity to them. Or I use a lot of two or three-word combinations that they're not only just sing single words, but I started painting these single words like spam. I like that because it had an explosive sound to it. They're like verbal utterings like smash. I always like words like that that had a noise quotient to them.

[00:34:22.220] - Speaker 2
Does how the letters look matter as well?

[00:34:24.950] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Then I was into typefaces and things like that And I felt like that's got to be part of the art. And then it moved on from there. But it was just like, I like the way words go across a canvas and your eyes are set like this, and they read from left to right. That's right. And so it became almost like a landscape. So I was picturing landscape. I mean, even if I look out on this lawn right here, I'm seeing a a horizontal activity here that I'm picking up with my eyes, and I like that. Landscapes, I like landscape painting, things like that. Maybe I could see this landscape horizontal where words would just be sitting on the landscape, and then they became the landscape.

[00:35:21.800] - Speaker 2
Do you have your Hollywood sign painting that's really wide?

[00:35:26.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That was an example I lived over on Western Avenue in Santa Monica Boulevard, and I would check out that Hollywood sign every day, and that was like a thermometer, a weather vein or something. If I couldn't read that sign, I knew I don't want to stay outside. It's too smoggy. If I can read it, then if it's very clear, then I know that the air is okay to breathe.

[00:35:58.520] - Speaker 2
Do you remember the thought of painting it from behind?

[00:36:02.640] - Speaker 1
Maybe I got the idea by looking in the mirror or just accidentally seeing the painting in a mirror, and the painting was behind me. So I thought, Well, that's not an unlivable image, is it? It's got some substance to it. And painting it from the back, it's like an ode to the rear view mirror or something Something like that. Yeah.

[00:36:32.260] - Speaker 2
Also feels like it could be telling a story about Hollywood, like behind the scenes or something. I don't know. It definitely creates a question mark when you look at it.

[00:36:42.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Just looking at it from afar was not enough for me. So I would go up there to the Hollywood sign. Back then, you could just walk right up to it and climb around it. It was really shoddy, made out of pieces of tin, I guess, on what looked like telephone poles. I think it's probably a lot of those poles are still holding the existing sign today. So I felt like, yeah, I see it from afar, but now I'm touching it.

[00:37:15.920] - Speaker 2
Tell me about perspective in general. So the choice of painting it from behind is changing the perspective from the perspective we normally see. I remember paintings you've done where we're looking at something and start moving to the side, and now we're seeing it from the side view and even further side view. Sometimes, we can barely make out what it is anymore because we're so close to parallel to the image. Tell me about the idea of perspective in general.

[00:37:48.260] - Speaker 1
I guess I like the concept of baseline perspective, and I think it came from movies. I would see movies as a kid, and there would always be some scene with the characters in the movie. They're traveling somewhere, and so they show you a little train, and the train always starts way off to the side, and it's tiny down here. Then pretty soon it comes along. Wow, that's panoramic, isn't it? I wanted to do some panoramic study. Also, I would always see this 20th century Fox logo and wanted to go ahead and complete its diminishment.

[00:38:37.040] - Speaker 2
You made it three-dimensional, essentially.

[00:38:39.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was almost like one of those freight trains or passenger trains that zooms in from the right-hand corner and completely takes over the left-hand corner. It's like a megaphonic experience.

[00:38:57.080] - Speaker 2
Did 20th Century Fox ever use your version?

[00:39:00.200] - Speaker 1
No. Really? No.

[00:39:02.020] - Speaker 2
I'm surprised.

[00:39:03.460] - Speaker 1
Yeah. No. I've rarely got any pushback from anybody. Even standard station. I had this idea about gas stations, and I always liked gas stations and the architecture of it. And even for a while, pictured myself, I could live in one of those gas stations. It's not bad at all. The canopy was so great. And park your car under the canopy, and And then there's a little house. You could live in it. I love that concept. So that was an extension of somewhere I thought I might want to live.

[00:39:41.700] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the way California has changed over the course of your life.

[00:39:47.500] - Speaker 1
I do remember. I mean, there was a specific thing. I was reading a Look magazine, and there was an article about Los Angeles, and it said that there This was like 1956, '06 or '07. There was a net gain of a thousand people a day. So, boy, if 500 people in LA left, that would mean 1,500 people would have to come in. And that was just, to me, phenomenal then. That, God, a thousand people a day? Net gain? That's astounding. But I'm I'm not sure what it is today. It might be greater or might be less. I don't know. But I like the old neighborhoods in downtown LA. I lived over in Silver Lake and Echo Park, Hollywood. I Now, when I drive over there, I see entire blocks gone. They've been swept clean. You know what's coming? Aircraft carriers. God. I see great change in the city. And a lot of the really pretty old buildings are gone or they're ready to be gone. I'm surprised Mousseau Franks is still there.

[00:41:13.860] - Speaker 2
You did the the photo book that opens up of Sunset Boulevard, The Two Sides of Sunset Boulevard. I remember I bought that right when I moved to California. Before, I even knew your work. I bought that book, and my plan was to have the two sides framed to put on either side of a hallway because I lived right on Sunset Boulevard, and I felt like this is the perfect... I never went through with putting it together, but I loved that feeling of... It was a place that I romanticized about because it was the '60s in California, Sunset Strip. For people who like music, it was a very important time.

[00:41:56.060] - Speaker 1
Pandora's Box. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was great.

[00:42:02.320] - Speaker 2
How did the idea come to do it in that fashion?

[00:42:05.400] - Speaker 1
Maybe it's some romantic connections to words again, like sunset. I didn't realize that I was going to come to LA and find that there was an actual Sunset Boulevard. Then, wow, they also give you a sunset. Then that became a target for this activity I had going in my mind to photograph buildings. Just for posterity's sake or just as you're acting like a reporter and you're capturing what's out there and bringing it back, printing it on paper. I've been doing that for years. They've got a website at the Getty called 12 Sunsets. If you If you get on that, it'll show you. They've taken my photography over the past 50 years. You can look at what it looked like, what a building looked like in 1966, in 1986, 1996. If If you want to know how many synagogues there are on Sunset Boulevard, bang, bang, bang. If you want to know how many dry cleaners, bang, bang, bang. I thought that's a piece of information that is beyond imagination, that they're able to do something like that. But there was a team of people that got all the pictures together, the photography, and then studied it like an archeological study in a way.

[00:43:46.880] - Speaker 2
When you did your first one, did you have any thoughts about the future or no? You felt like this is just documenting the moment?

[00:43:53.680] - Speaker 1
Well, no. I had notions about what it would be like. And then, of course, I didn't know.

[00:44:01.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah, can't know.

[00:44:04.180] - Speaker 1
But the possibility was always out there, and I like the absurdity of it.

[00:44:11.900] - Speaker 2
What can you and can't you learn in in a hard school.

[00:44:16.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think, well, that you can learn is that there shouldn't really be any rules.

[00:44:25.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:44:26.980] - Speaker 1
All possibilities are out there. That disturbed some people because they like to have their thinking grounded in reason instead of absurdity or possible things out there in space. That's something I learned there. Luckily, I was around a lot of students that also were in a competitive sense, inspiring each other. We didn't get everything we learned from the instructors. We did learn a lot from them, but we got to learn a lot by just being around each other, competing and making pictures and crazy art. It was good for all that.

[00:45:19.520] - Speaker 2
At some point over the course of your life, from where you started till now, and I'm not talking about your art, I'm talking about the fine art world. The fine art world became mainstream. It was not when you were starting. When you started going into art, no one went into art thinking it's a serious career. It might be something to do, but it wasn't like, I'm going to be successful doing this thing.

[00:45:51.640] - Speaker 1
No. It didn't promise you a successful career like they do today. You go to our art school today and there's all kinds of commercial possibilities to spin off into that you can make a living from. But we just wanted to make art till we spit blood.

[00:46:09.960] - Speaker 2
It was almost deciding not to pursue anything that could be successful.

[00:46:16.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:46:17.040] - Speaker 2
Does that sound right?

[00:46:18.350] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, or that would be condescending or where you'd be edging into the world of commercial art or something like that. That was frowned on, I guess. Yeah. But then a lot of people would... We all made a living from it, and I make a living from it. But I'm still in a state of wonderment, trying to figure the whole thing out. Yeah.

[00:46:47.480] - Speaker 2
I read that one of your paintings, 8 or 10 years ago now, sold at auction for 50 something million dollars. Do you know which painting I'm talking about? Yeah. Okay. Tell me, from its inception, when you made it, what was the reaction to it? When it originally sold, what it sold for, if you remember, and then the life story of this painting.

[00:47:12.500] - Speaker 1
It was painted about 1965, I guess. It was a painting called Radio. I painted the word radio, and then I somehow wanted to take some sea clamps, Carpenter sea clamps, and pinch these letters to pinch them, and just to aggravate the theme. I believe I had the... I showed these things at the Farris Gallery, and I didn't sell them. I didn't sell anything for quite a while. But then eventually, I think maybe 10 years later or something, I sold it for probably $500. And out of that, I got $250, which I had to pay taxes on.

[00:47:59.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah, Yeah. And then do you know what happened to it after that?

[00:48:03.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was bought by Jack Quinn, who was an attorney. He helped a lot of artists out, and he bought the painting, and they had it in their home for years and years. And then it was sold after he died. And he was a proponent for 10% resale royalty for artists, for unique works of art, which never really became law. They tried to invent this thing that every time work was sold, artist gets 10% of it. But it took a little bit here in the state of California, and then they voted it out. So of course, I When that sold and I heard about that, I wanted to say, Where's my cut? But there wasn't any. That's the folly of it all.

[00:48:54.700] - Speaker 2
Well, the good news is that if someone would pay for that work, maybe your other works might be worth something.

[00:49:01.600] - Speaker 1
I guess so. It's supposed to work that way. Not always.

[00:49:09.080] - Speaker 2
I asked you about the mainstreaming of art. When do you think it got more taken seriously in the public? What made that happen?

[00:49:19.640] - Speaker 1
Well, a change in attitude, I guess, that goes from generation to generation. You had the abstract expressionist before that. You had Well, you might say Ashtan School or New York School of Painting, and that lasted into '30s and '40s, and you had French surrealism come in there. Then Picasso was always working at that time. It was always evolving into newer and different things. It's just like the music world, I guess. You got rock 'n' Billy coming out of race music and rock and roll coming out of that. Then jazz has always been around. So it's the same framework. I think the art world and the music world is a lot alike. And you might say literature, too, I guess. There's just these waves of people coming and going and creating new things. And it's pretty active. It's pretty active in the audience out there and the people who are producing it, the artist, there's no shortage of them.

[00:50:35.020] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the difference between seeing a reproduction of an image in a book versus seeing the real thing in a museum up close.

[00:50:44.500] - Speaker 1
I got inspired my reproductions. Sometimes the postie stamp picture. This thing right here, I saw as a little illustration in a book on the subject of Dada, the Dada movement in Germany. And that was all I needed for that. And I wanted to push it another step forward when I called the Museum of Modern Art and wanted to see it in person, and they showed me. But I saw little reproductions hit me just as hard as a real work. I didn't see a lot of real works until later on.

[00:51:25.040] - Speaker 2
When you saw the real version of the Dada piece, Was there any revelation that was different than seeing the postage stamp or no?

[00:51:34.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah, there's some color in here. There's some little red ink that I didn't really know, and it didn't seem to matter. My love for this little thing here was enough that it didn't matter if there were colors in here. But seeing the colors was like a bonus. Yeah.

[00:51:56.280] - Speaker 2
What do you think makes an American artist, besides coming from here, in terms of the work?

[00:52:03.460] - Speaker 1
It's more international than ever. And so influences are across the pond and everywhere. So I think it's so universal now, but it used to be closeted off in little pockets. What's happening in France and what's happening in England is another thing. Like David Hockney and his friends, you could look at their work and say, Yeah, they're all connected somehow. They had a solid look that was generally similar. And as time goes by, you can get fatigued by looking at their work, and then somebody else comes along. So it's unpredictable.

[00:52:54.570] - Speaker 2
I read that you were included in the first ever pop art exhibition in Pasadena in 1962. What do you remember about that time?

[00:53:06.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was an exhibit put together by Walter Ops. And he was, at that time, the director of the Pasadena Art Museum It's a really eclectic, out-of-the-way museum to have. And you'd be around him for five minutes, and you'd realize that this guy's for real, and he had something to say. Yeah. It was like a real experience to be around this guy. He had a way of... Well, first of all, he would bum a cigarette from me. He'd walk back and forth, puffing this it. And then Andy's here walking back and forth, speaking and saying great things as he's walking back and forth. When he leaves the room, he realized you've learned something. Wow, that's great. And so he put all this together. He put that show together, and I felt honored to be in it. It was good. I felt like a lot of these other artists that were in that show, they shared some common sympathies, an openness to the world of commerce, the pop culture, and what's happening in the world today, and choosing subjects that are A figurative instead of abstract like they were for years, which was great art, too.

[00:54:38.580] - Speaker 1
The abstract expressionists and all those people, abstract painting. And they're still abstract painters today. They're pretty good.

[00:54:46.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Who else was in that show in '62? Do you remember?

[00:54:50.460] - Speaker 1
Joe Good was in there. I grew up with him. He was an altar boy in my church. He was like the altar boy with a black eye like he'd see in Norman Rockwell paintings. Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

[00:55:13.740] - Speaker 2
Had you seen Roy's work before, that exhibit?

[00:55:16.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Roy Lichtenstein. Where would you have seen it? I saw that in 1961 at the Leo Castelli Gallery. I was in Europe and painted a bunch of little pictures about that size and wanted to show them to Leo Castelli, and I respected him. He had a real good gallery. He said, Let me show you in the back room. Go back there. There was a painting there of somebody named Roy Lichtenstein. I never heard of him. I got to know him. He was a good friend, finally. But it was a picture of tennis shoes. I just felt like, Oh, God, that's hard to look That hurts. It's aggravating and it's so terrible, and then it's got some possibility to it. And then, damn, that thing might be profound.

[00:56:11.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's amazing. It sneaks up on you.

[00:56:14.690] - Speaker 1
I love that painting Yeah. You love it. The tennis shoes. All of his art was made that way. He had a way of seeing the world through comic book eyes. And he took that and ran with it and had a very good, besides career of it, he created some really great works.

[00:56:34.410] - Speaker 2
You talked about your trip to Europe and not really feeling the European art as much as the American art. Was there anything about the place that you remember about Europe that spoke to you? Just the location, the buildings, the experience?

[00:56:52.580] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I went all over. I went through Spain, and I love this San Sebastian, Spain, and went to Barcelona, Madrid, and Lisbon, and all around Europe. I didn't get as far as Eastern Europe. I went through the Greek Isles, and I bought a a Dushow. You know those cars?

[00:57:18.980] - Speaker 2
I think so. It's a little teeny car.

[00:57:22.060] - Speaker 1
It looks like a throw away vehicle. A real teeny, and it got 60 miles to a gallon of gas. I drove all over Europe and the British Isles, too.

[00:57:34.580] - Speaker 2
It looks like a Volkswagen Bug, but smaller and like a toy version of a Volkswagen Bug.

[00:57:42.840] - Speaker 1
It was very flimsy. It was like paper thin. I haven't seen one in LA for a long time. No, not in a long time.

[00:57:52.720] - Speaker 2
I see them sometimes in other places in the world.

[00:57:55.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But Europe I went to the museums over there, and I learned quite a bit by seeing the museums. I didn't get so much influence from all these historical artists. I didn't get so much from that. But I was more into what was happening in America. But, hell, Europe is the beginning of it.

[00:58:21.820] - Speaker 2
It had moved at the time that you were... It does. It always moves around.

[00:58:28.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:58:30.000] - Speaker 2
Have you used any unusual materials over the years?

[00:58:33.240] - Speaker 1
I was using oil paint for a long time, and then I felt like I was putting a skin on a surface and that I wanted to do something else, like stain the surface in some way or other. I started using gunpowder, which is charcoal and sulfur. Instead of using graphite, gunpowder, I was I was able to make an image with it and correct it. If I made a mistake, easy to correct. Not so much with graphite. Then I started using staining things with grass cut from and rubbing the grass in, that thing, and Axel grease and caviar, and things like that that made images. But I didn't know about the last ability of them or anything like that.

[00:59:31.900] - Speaker 2
Do you know if they survived?

[00:59:33.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah, they mostly had. But I made a Hollywood image out of Pepto-Bismol. If you leave that out in the open, eventually, it's almost 50 years old, and the image is still there, but it's faded a little bit. So no customer guarantee. Yeah.

[01:00:01.640] - Speaker 2
Are there any themes that you've returned to over the years?

[01:00:06.680] - Speaker 1
Well, I haven't gone back to gas stations. I guess the main theme is words, I guess, that persist right up to today. I'm looking at it a little like it's, well, could I call it poetry? Is that too ambitious to call it poetry or what? But I I find myself making these little word things, and they mean something to me, but I don't think too much about it.

[01:00:37.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah. There was a period where you were using words, but they weren't complete words. There were parts of words or letters were left out.

[01:00:46.400] - Speaker 1
I did a few things like that, but then that began to... It made me question what I'm doing. And are you deliberately leaving these letters out or copying this word?

[01:00:58.760] - Speaker 2
Too much of a choice. Yeah. How's your relationship to making art changed over the course of your life?

[01:01:08.320] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm surprised that I'm still at it. Physically, I can handle it, and I still have the same motivation and belief in it. I'm not distracted from the many things that are out there. I see that the world's full of cacophony, noise, and visual and otherwise. And so I maintain my love of doing it. So stop the presses.

[01:01:42.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah. What's the feeling you get when you finish a piece?

[01:01:46.220] - Speaker 1
Usually, I know when I'm finished. Sometimes I'll stop a little early and then say, Don't go any further. And it just has to round itself out. Every so often, I'll start something, and then I've got to tear it up, start over again.

[01:02:03.260] - Speaker 2
Tell me about life in the desert.

[01:02:05.780] - Speaker 1
I started going out there in the late '40s. I had this friend named Harry Cohn. His father had a movie studio called Columbia Pictures. And somehow he was given this property inside of Joshua Tree National Park. And somebody took me out there. I knew this young Harry Cohn, who died a few years ago, but he lived back in these enormous boulders with a house built in the 1930s. Wow. And it still exists.

[01:02:41.170] - Speaker 2
Sounds great.

[01:02:42.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's down a little dirt road Inside the park, there's a few privately-owned parcels inside the park. I just said, Oh, more. This is just great. I mean, the Joshua trees and all this. And I found a property that I got up near Pioneer town, if you know where that is.

[01:03:06.060] - Speaker 2
I don't know where that is. What else is near there?

[01:03:08.260] - Speaker 1
Yucca Valley, Joshua tree, basically. It's high desert, so it's like 5,000 feet. And then so I got this place in '75 and started building a house out there. And finally, it took about four or five years to build this house. And I go out there all the time. So I'll I go out for a week or 10 days. I don't usually make much art out there because I go out there and I read or I take care of little repairs, things like that. Events of plain living.

[01:03:47.340] - Speaker 2
When you're out there, do you see many people or is it more- No, you don't see anybody around.

[01:03:53.260] - Speaker 1
I mean, I've got a neighbor maybe that's a mile away that I never see. So it's remote and Sounds great. For all that, it's great to have it be remote like that. And there's no progress around it or anything. But every so often, a fire will get near there, but it's a little bit on the other side of Big Bear Lake. It's the desert side of Big Bear Lake. It's a habit of a living habit that I don't go out there and look at the landscape and want to take impressions from it and make art from it. So I don't really do that. But it's a living thing, habitual routine that I find myself in that I love doing.

[01:04:48.280] - Speaker 2
You think it's what you see or the silence?

[01:04:51.920] - Speaker 1
Silence has a lot to do with it. There's a military base out there, Marine 29 Palms Marine base. And you hear helicopters go over every so often, but it's very remote and good for that reason.

[01:05:10.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it sounds great. Yeah. Tell me the timeline from an idea for a work until you have a finished work, typically, or is there no typical?

[01:05:23.060] - Speaker 1
I don't often have a notion to do something where I'm forced to put it off for a while and still keep on to the idea. I usually get on to things soon, but then sometimes I'll work on a painting for, I don't know, three or four years. I did one of the Los Angeles County Museum on Fire, and I would paint on that thing for a couple of months, and then I'd put it away for six months and paint on it for a while and then put it away for another period of time. It's not like something It has a deadline to it.

[01:06:05.860] - Speaker 2
Would you say there are always works in progress around?

[01:06:10.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Right now, I have about four or five things that I put aside, but it's there to look at. But I know I've got progress to make on it, but I'll do it when I get to it. Do you understand?

[01:06:27.620] - Speaker 2
Are there any that start finish, they just happen?

[01:06:31.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I'll do that with things that are simple or involve one or two colors or things like that that I feel like are right. But generally, I start working on something and I stick with it until it's done.

[01:06:49.120] - Speaker 2
Do you remember the initial thought behind the Museum on Fire Painting?

[01:06:56.300] - Speaker 1
That came out of the angle of the of the museum, the way it was in the picture, is really doing the same thing as that 20th century fox or the standard-Perspective. Yeah, the perspective. It goes from lower right-hand corner to upper left-hand corner in the slope of the building and everything. And then you get up here and you've got a fire happening. And then over here, you've got this green placid lawn or whatever it is. And so you got the hotspot over here, and you I almost could fall asleep over here.

[01:07:31.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah. But the thought of deciding, I'm going to paint the museum on fire, as opposed to just painting the museum, do you remember the instant of it's going to be on fire?

[01:07:43.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I'd use the idea of fire in certain things. I made a book called Very Small Fires. I've got no unreasonable attachment to fires, but I felt like they were additional things in a picture. They were very colorful. You'd have this blast of light happening over here. But the whole thing with the museum started with a helicopter ride that I took over LA, and we somehow fell into... Somebody said, You want to take it? Yeah, sure. I'll take my Polaroid camera with me. And we went all over LA in a period of 45 minutes. You could see the entire city. You see thousands and thousands of swimming pools. And then we somehow came around over by the LA County Museum, and I took some pictures of it. I always felt like it was an authority figure in some ways, and that maybe this is my statement against this authority figure. Let it burn.. It became that and a combination of just wanting to paint a picture, just the idea of keeping my hands busy. Yeah.

[01:09:11.080] - Speaker 2
Has that painting ever shown at that museum?

[01:09:14.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was. About three months ago. It was in my exhibit there at the county museum. Fantastic.

[01:09:21.100] - Speaker 2
Would you say you're always working?

[01:09:24.700] - Speaker 1
Pretty much, yeah. I mean, I don't take vacation break Thanks so much. I'm not really into that. I don't want to work. I do like my studio, and I find a security in just being around the way I work. There always seems to be something urgently needs to be worked on and thought about.

[01:09:54.150] - Speaker 2
Is there a typical time of day you like to paint?

[01:09:58.540] - Speaker 1
Usually during the day, sometimes at night, and phone doesn't ring, things like that. And that can be uplifting.

[01:10:10.940] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Mason Williams.

[01:10:13.460] - Speaker 1
Mason, he was a friend of mine in third grade in Oklahoma City. He and I were good friends, and he and I came to California together and lived in a boarding house downtown. Mason, he went off, and he was in the Navy for a couple of years, and I just stayed in the art school. And then he came back, and I talked to him all the time. And he lives in Oregon now. And he and I have We did projects together, and I've done artwork for him, and he's a really interesting character and talented great musician, and feel lucky to have him as a friend.

[01:11:01.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, great musician, and he also was involved in comedy. I think he discovered Steve Martin. Yeah.

[01:11:07.980] - Speaker 1
He and Steve played Banjo together, and he actually hired Steve to write the Smothers Brothers.

[01:11:18.170] - Speaker 2
Yeah, amazing. When you have a work that's a series of images, let's say the Gas Station book, tell me about what goes into a sequence.

[01:11:28.540] - Speaker 1
It's an evolving thing that sometimes is just you make these decisions. If I have 26 photographs in front of me, how do I know where they're going to go and how they fit together? There's no common game plan, anything like that.

[01:11:49.290] - Speaker 2
Can you move them around and see what happens?

[01:11:51.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's a matter of moving around. It's almost like making a collage in a way. Then there's a routine that I don't want to be too sensible or too aggressive or too ununderstandable.

[01:12:08.440] - Speaker 2
Do you ever put limitations on your work?

[01:12:13.100] - Speaker 1
I think I do, and probably usually when I I knew I don't know it, what I'm doing.

[01:12:17.900] - Speaker 2
Do you ever say, I'm only going to work in black and white, for example, or I'm only going to make it, it can't be bigger than this size.

[01:12:24.660] - Speaker 1
When I was in school, I admired Franz Klein because he chose to work only in black and white, mostly. And I thought, God, what a commitment to that. And I like the commitment as well as I did the work of art. I So everybody had respect for Marcel Duchamp when he said, Hey, I'm not going to paint anymore. That was like 1925. He said, I'm making no more art. He broke his rule there. He was making little things all all along. But the idea of saying, standing up to the world saying, I'm not going to make any more art. I mean, somehow it taught us something. I don't know why.

[01:13:12.400] - Speaker 2
I've heard you say, I'll paraphrase incorrectly, but something about certain works are touched by angels. You've had that experience. Tell me what you meant by it, and tell me a work that you think was touched by angels.

[01:13:30.000] - Speaker 1
I might think of, well, the book I did called 26 Gasoline Stations, I thought was off by itself, and it didn't nod to the world of painting or bookmaking or anything in any respect. And so I thought it was off by itself. So that's, I guess, where the angels live. Maybe that was touched by angels. I don't know. Probably what I was thinking of. Yeah.

[01:14:03.080] - Speaker 2
I like it. I like thinking about it.

[01:14:08.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And then every so often I think about nonverbal communication. How you can That always reminded me of when they were going to interview Thelonious Monk for a music magazine, and I think he said, Okay, I'll do it if I can bring a friend along with me. And they said, Okay, Sure. Yeah. So the interviewer is saying, Mr. Monk, what do you think about country and Western music? He doesn't say anything. Long period of time in the interview, I was saying, Mr. Monk, what do you think about cowboy music? Country and Western music? Still no answer. Then Monk turns to his friend and says, Do you think that guy's hard of hearing?

[01:15:00.000] - Speaker 2
Incredible. That's amazing. Amazing. What would you say the most beautiful place on Earth you've ever been?

[01:15:10.640] - Speaker 1
San Francisco. I can point to Why I'm saying this? Because I visited there as a kid back in the late 1940s with my folks, and we drove through there and we had some relatives there. So San Francisco, and every time I go there, I say, This is the most beautiful city in the world.

[01:15:32.620] - Speaker 2
Do you think the hills have something to do with it?

[01:15:34.980] - Speaker 1
The mystery of it, the Chinatown, the bridges.

[01:15:40.740] - Speaker 2
The Victorian houses.

[01:15:43.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the houses and everything about it. It's just got this romantic, Dashiell Hammet, flavor to it that I really feel like it is the most beautiful city in the world. But then nature Of course. I mean, places that you go where there's silence, like the desert. Well, yes, that's beautiful, too.

[01:16:08.720] - Speaker 2
You never had the calling to move to San Francisco?

[01:16:11.380] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:16:12.300] - Speaker 2
Why do you think?

[01:16:13.220] - Speaker 1
I don't know. It's I wanted to visit there. I love New York, but I go there on my own terms, and I see my friends, and then I get out of town. But if I had to live there, I think it would be a different set of circumstances circumstances for an artist to live there and then have to bring materials to your studio and get a two by four across town without... And boy, what an issue that is. I didn't like that. I like the idea of Southern California.

[01:16:47.220] - Speaker 2
Curators, collectors, and artists. Tell me about the mindset of those three different categories of people.

[01:16:54.600] - Speaker 1
Curators, collectors, and artists. Collectors are curious kind. Their minds are off in different directions. The artist is thinking only of himself, not so much where he fits into this thing. But curators have a particular knowledge of I was lucky enough to work with the man that is now the director of Museum of Modern Art in New York, Christophe Chéri. And he curated an exhibit of mine that was up about a year and a a year ago there that went to the county museum. And he wanted to see every work that I did, and he only would put it in the exhibit if he could see it in person. He had to see that thing in person. So if I can't go to that collector's house and see it on a wall, well, I'm not interested in borrowing it. I've got to see that thing in person. And so the personal contact with a curator is essential. And he's that way. He's one of those people.

[01:18:04.500] - Speaker 2
Are most curators open to collaboration with the artist?

[01:18:09.180] - Speaker 1
Well, this man certainly was. And he wouldn't put something in the show that I didn't approve of or why should I care what he puts in his exhibit. But I did have a few choices along the way, and he was worth with me. On that. Great. I was lucky to have him. Yeah.

[01:18:35.360] - Speaker 2
Are you ever surprised seeing your art up next to other artists? Do you ever get any either a good or bad feeling about it?

[01:18:45.080] - Speaker 1
I mean, I've seen my work in exhibits alongside other people, and I might get a tug from a laugh out of it.

[01:18:53.660] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:18:54.360] - Speaker 1
Just the curiosity of these two supposedly thoughtful artists. It sounds like you have fun doing what you're doing. Yeah. I don't think I would if I didn't have fun with it. No, I do that. Every so often, something will come up that requires a lot of labor and concentration. That might make me think and make me want to say, Oh, God, I got to do that now. But generally, I get with it, and I like it.

[01:19:35.980] - Speaker 2
Would you say that once you have the idea, you feel in service to the idea?

[01:19:42.740] - Speaker 1
Yes. I've got a notion of what I think the idea is going to be. Then the execution of it will be something else. Sometimes, I don't know which way it's going to I go.

[01:20:00.520] - Speaker 2
Do you do sketches?

[01:20:03.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I do a lot of little writings and sometimes sketches. They can be misleading. They can distort your thinking. But I like to do that when I'm at a restaurant or something.

[01:20:19.280] - Speaker 2
What might be something you would write?

[01:20:23.180] - Speaker 1
Lately, I've just done a little thing of doorways, a drawing of a doorway at an angle and what that might be or imagining that as being a bigger work, like a bigger painting, as a first step towards a painting.

[01:20:45.640] - Speaker 2
Would you say it always starts with something you actually see in the world?

[01:20:49.960] - Speaker 1
Sometimes I'll get an inspiration from other artists' work. There's a Danish artist that named Hammershoy, William Hammershoy. He painted these sad-looking interior paintings in 1900 or something. But somehow I saw this wainscoting inside of a room and the architecture around the doorway and all that. I say, I don't know, maybe I'll visit that and see if I can push that along. And yet it's going to look nothing like his work, but it'll be a trigger.

[01:21:32.860] - Speaker 2
It's an interesting thing when you see work that an artist does, it opens possibilities of what can happen. Like, he made a left turn. What happens if we go right? What happens if we go up?

[01:21:48.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and set it down. Yeah. Maybe down is the way to go. Maybe. You can crash going down, can't you? Yeah, but maybe that's good.

[01:21:56.530] - Speaker 2
Maybe we want to crash. You never know. How often do you start something and then decide this is not going to work?

[01:22:06.860] - Speaker 1
Usually, it's in the early stage. So I don't set aside a canvas and then start on it and then It's always a little different. But I can usually stop something early if I don't have some hope for it. Yeah.

[01:22:25.500] - Speaker 2
Most things, if you get off to a poor start, do you find that it and turns into something that you like?

[01:22:32.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Sometimes it's an accident that almost falls on your foot and you don't realize what's happened. And this accident is, damn, it's good. You put the wrong color on there. But wow, something is different and something happened that you either learn from or you hit upon. And you didn't start out that way. You didn't really want that to happen. But it's an accident. So accidents are great. People don't realize that accidents are a vital part of things.

[01:23:08.800] - Speaker 2
How much of the whole enterprise would you say is intellectual?

[01:23:18.420] - Speaker 1
What did Yogi Berra say? Baseball is 99% intellectual, and the other half is physical.

[01:23:59.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
