[00:00:02.760] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:09.000] - Speaker 
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around.

[00:00:22.840] - Speaker 2
We came here, I said okay. You know, I think let's take a year. And at the same time, it was an adventure to go out and explore creatively, a way to make a film with no comfort of my country and my language and all the things. Because I was I could have become a very comfortable artist, being in my own ranchito in Mexico. But anyway, so it was different. Things never planned to be so, so many years. But then it happened.

[00:00:50.360] - Speaker 3
Any idea what in your life, in your upbringing, allowed you to have the freedom you have and the way you approach your art because you feel completely free.

[00:01:04.030] - Speaker 2
There's a certain innocence, I guess, because I do not come from Academy and none of my family were in the art business. Let's say of the scenery. There is no. I'm like the black sheep, let's put it that way. And so suddenly I'm like a autodidactic, self-made, savage, naive if you like, or innocent kind of guy. That in a way, the only way for me to learn was to explore, make mistakes, and the process of it in a way, is a natural stage for me to be, you know, basically trying things and and not thinking rationally with. I will say I have learned to get some principles that I learned that you have to have as an artist, but not rules that I never learn rules, let's put it that way. And I think that liberated me a little bit. You know, it's amazing.

[00:02:05.460] - Speaker 3
It's amazing to see. And that's why I feel so. I feel there's a I feel sympathetic with you, like I feel like somehow we ended up in this place. I don't really understand how, um, but I think I get the feeling both of us feel free to see the world that we see without any conventional anything like that. All the convention is out of it.

[00:02:34.060] - Speaker 2
Exactly. I think I think actually the we you know, I have been now a lot into the neuroscience and meditation and things in the last years, and I think that has had a huge impact on me, because at the end, what I have learned is that we create our own reality.

[00:02:55.020] - Speaker 3
So it's a projection. It's all a projection. It's all made up. Yeah.

[00:02:59.530] - Speaker 2
It's fascinating. So that has encouraged me to go further and further with no fear of not being. Let's put it this way. To have the courage to be disliked. Yes, yes. And that I found it liberating.

[00:03:17.730] - Speaker 3
But you're making something. I imagine you're making something that you love. Yes.

[00:03:24.090] - Speaker 2
And that at that, I am absolutely interested to. To say, to feel, to approach, to explore, to solve. And that's the only way I do what I do. I there is no other reason I could because I think and I think it's okay to make, I would say a film by many reasons, right? Even to get money if you need money. Well, that's like a guy who built a table. As a carpenter, you do it because you need a job, and it's a craft, and you need to feed your family. And that's fantastic. As you know how to make films, that's your craft and you do it. That's right. That's absolutely dignified and honorable. But for me, I think that beyond that, I need to have a very profound reason, because for me, the exploration is a journey that demands me an enormous amount of energy and not necessarily pleasant all the time. You know, I have been learning how to make it more pleasant and be a little bit more confident to allow it.

[00:04:38.750] - Speaker 2
And talking about Birdman, the film that you expressed that you have liked, that's what that was one of the first films that I enjoyed making it, that I laughed making it, you know.

[00:04:51.870] - Speaker 3
I understand you laughed left making it. Do you think of it as a comedy?

[00:04:57.100] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes. I want to laugh about the stupidity that we are, that our lives normally are about our dramas. You know, every time that we make a drama, it's an ego, it's stupid. It's. We create that there's no reason. So the drama of this character, which I identify enormously when we make dramas about the narrative of stories that we made in ourselves. Um, it's a little ridiculous and pathetic. And at the same time, I feel empathy. I mean, I'm not saying this like, like detached from that, but is to, to learn about. I wanted to explore that from the humor, from the sense of humor, not from the, you know, from the pain.

[00:05:40.660] - Speaker 3
Yeah. I'll tell you, I'm shocked just because I don't see it as a comedy at all. No, I see it as a I see it as deadly serious. It's funny and ridiculous, This sucks, but I don't see it as a comedy at all.

[00:05:55.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that the the drama and the the dilemma of of Riggan Thomson that is called the character that Michael Keaton plays is a very serious thing because he wants to revalidate himself, he wants to feel appreciated. He wants to feel love, he wants to validate himself. And who don't want that. We all what we do. I always said what what we do, no matter what, is to be loved and to be understood. And and I think as, as this monk that I like he said, understand this the other way to say love is the other, you know, the other word of love. And so he wants to be understood. And he, he but obviously looking for it in the wrong place in the wrong way.

[00:06:44.210] - Speaker 3
So on the.

[00:06:44.650] - Speaker 2
Surface. On the surface, yeah. And committing the same mistake by, by wanting something very profound and very valuable and very needed. He goes to the wrong execution, let's say. So that's what makes it funny. But as you said, yeah, it's a very profound wound.

[00:07:03.280] - Speaker 3
And seeing him go from he's in this pressure filled situation and it seems like everything is going wrong in, in making this dream happen. And then on top of that, the ex-wife comes the pregnancy, the the threat of pregnancy, the daughter. Like like the combination. It's like from every angle, the the oppressive nature of life is just smothering him. It's it's wild to see. So that's why maybe it's, uh, it's funny in how extreme it is, but I felt all of that. It made me very uneasy. It made me.

[00:07:44.640] - Speaker 2
In which part? You connect with that you personally. Did you that have you felt that things? I mean, if it affect you, it was reflecting or it was projecting something personal.

[00:07:54.710] - Speaker 3
I know how my state of mind is so important to the work that I do. Like if I have a critical listening to do, if I'm in a bad mood or not feeling well, I won't do it. I don't want to bring any personal baggage to my work unless that's what it's about. You know, if it's about that. Um, but from A to B in an even enough place to really take in what's happening. Um, it doesn't always come easy. Sometimes it does, but not always. And I try to live in a way. I spend most of my time in the jungle of either Kauai or Costa Rica, and I see very few people. I have my little family unit. We all stay together. We all travel together wherever we go and live a little bit of a monk like life, you know, never, never do anything social. Really. It suits my temperament. It suits my temperament. And some of your earlier films, the more aggressive ones I was wary to see.

[00:09:00.220] - Speaker 3
I remember trying to watch 21g because it seemed so interesting to me, and I watched maybe the first ten minutes back when it came out, and it felt like, I don't think I can watch this, like it's too much, it's too much, it's too much. I felt the same way about early Tarantino movies. It's like it, didn't it? And now both of you are probably my two favorite directors. I would say my two favorite directors. Um, and I think it's because you're, you're you're allowing to go past reality. And it's thrilling to me. I had a I remember when I saw Birdman right when it came out. A lot of people I don't watch so many movies. It's funny because I have a degree in film and television from NYU, I studied film. Um, but for some reason I feel like most movies are not for me. I don't I don't like mainstream movies. I don't like seeing violence. I don't want to feel bad. And the nature of even if it has a happy ending, the dramatic arc feels bad, and most of the time I just don't want to go through that.

[00:10:03.320] - Speaker 3
I don't like going on roller coasters, you know? I don't. I don't like adrenaline. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like peace. So I, I feel like it's few and far between that a movie speaks to me. And I remember when I saw Birdman very quickly. It's not the opening shot, but the opening shot of our of our lead actor. He's levitating. Mhm. But I didn't realize he was levitating right away because it's such an ordinary environment. I don't know anything that's going on. It was just a strange sensation of is he levitating? You know, it was more of a question. Mhm. And um, and it's one of the things I things I wanted to ask about. In particular, I remember there's a scene that since the first time I saw it. I wanted to understand it, which is after, uh, he floats and flies and he goes into the theater. There's a taxi driver who goes in and have to say, hey, you didn't pay.

[00:11:05.070] - Speaker 4
Yeah. So is that.

[00:11:07.390] - Speaker 3
Telling us everything that we've seen is imagination? Or does it just open the door of possibility that that's what it is?

[00:11:14.070] - Speaker 2
No, I think I deliberately, uh, put that I planted that seed to really do not make cheap tricks. Meaning it's obvious that the guy has been going there with the taxi, but. But he thinks that he got there fly. And that's that's the delusional mind of the ego, right? The ego allows us or make us. The ego does not like to be in the present moment and the reality. So ego takes us always to the future and what we will achieve, what we will do, what we are missing, that and how we are going to get that or to the past, our judgments, who we are, what we did wrong. So in a way, this guy is all the time battling, trying to be present and he can't. And that was a hint for me to other people to understand that all these beautiful flying things that he has this almost and again, that maybe betraying what some people felt or thought. It's okay. But but that's that. For me, it was a very honest way as a filmmaker to not mislead in a, in a, in a again in a, in a cheap trick.

[00:12:31.620] - Speaker 2
But there's planted seeds but it's good that they are not are always I try to execute it not in your face but that you are navigating to say I have been there too. I sometimes have feel things that I feel that are so real that I'm sure that they are real, and maybe they are not. Doesn't matter. All our perception and our experience in life is created, and this guy was creating a whole idea of who he was, who he should be, instead of who he was.

[00:13:03.930] - Speaker 3
You know? Amazing. And when I saw it, first time I saw the movie, I was I questioned it. This time I saw it, I watched it two nights ago again. And I feel like you did it in a way where it's not important at all. Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:13:22.250] - Speaker 2
That, that that event. That. Yes.

[00:13:24.090] - Speaker 3
That event. The taxi driver coming in. Hey, you didn't pay it. It. Even the way it's blocked, he could even be talking about someone else. We don't see anyone else. But I think I live so far outside of outside of reality that I was almost.

[00:13:41.560] - Speaker 4
More.

[00:13:43.000] - Speaker 3
Upset at the chance that he was in the cab.

[00:13:47.440] - Speaker 5
Exactly, exactly.

[00:13:48.800] - Speaker 2
But you know, all the people and actually, you know, there's there's some actually in that same scene, uh, he's set to the car, to the taxi driver. Stop the music. Yeah. And the music.

[00:14:00.000] - Speaker 3
Stop. Yes, I remember he's.

[00:14:01.640] - Speaker 2
Talking to me. He's talking to you. He's.

[00:14:03.800] - Speaker 3
But he doesn't know that. He's talking to the taxi driver.

[00:14:06.320] - Speaker 2
No. He's talking. He broke the wall. Yes. And he is the owner of your imagination and my imagination. And now we are in his own world. And we belong to that fiction that I create. And that's the power.

[00:14:19.080] - Speaker 3
We're experiencing through his experience.

[00:14:22.040] - Speaker 2
Exactly. I did that in order that now we are in his own experience. We are flying with him. We are in his own mind. And and that's what in a way, this was about. And I was trying to get layers more profoundly about that. We all have been there in a in a way, and it's beautiful to be there in that way. And, uh, and, or, you know, when, when, when he's going to the stage and there's a drummer playing if it's, if it's there or not, I don't care. It's just how he's feeling and it's a feeling and life is how you feel about it. It's not what it is. It's what you made about something is what really counts. Yes. So the same experience, the same reality can be lived completely different by two persons depending what you make about what music you hear in that moment that you are living. And all the time the people is asking me, uh, is is is Emma Thompson looking and he's flying or he die?

[00:15:21.910] - Speaker 2
He and I don't know that answer. I don't know that answer. And I don't want to answer because honestly, I change my mind depending on what mood I see. If you see the movie in some mood, maybe it will tell you something or it will make you feel that he did something. And maybe the next time in ten years you will feel different about it. For the ending, I don't have any conclusion, you know. Even myself, you know.

[00:15:43.580] - Speaker 3
Yeah. How close? How close is the film to the script?

[00:15:49.340] - Speaker 2
It was very close. Very close. It took me a lot of time. It took me like for me and Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo, like four years to really put it together. It was it became, it was shaping every time differently. And I have a lot of challenges because it took me like three years to find money to, to get it. And because the budget, I shot the film in 19 days, which is crazy. Crazy. And the reason is because obviously I have to really shape it to the possibilities, economical possibilities, the physical possibilities. So the script was changing and changing and as you know, I shot with very long takes, so there was no many possibilities to change things, you know. So there was no a nowhere. It was like a long spaghetti. I could I could not cut it, you know. So it has to be very well planned. So yeah, it was, it was very, very close to what really was written.

[00:16:44.720] - Speaker 2
I mean, I couldn't improvise because every shot was pre-planned and, and has to be the way it is to, to, to to stitch it, you know what I mean?

[00:16:56.160] - Speaker 3
How different can the movie be from the same script? Does the script tell you one movie, or could you make five different movies from that?

[00:17:05.440] - Speaker 2
You can make 300 movies. It's like if you and I, if you and I have the same script. Yes, you. There's no way you and I will do the same movie, because that movie will reflect who you are. Since the moment that you choose a face, an actor or an actress, when you choose the color of a, of a, of a, of a shirt or a or a pant, the style of the wardrobe, the makeup and the hair, the attitude of the character, the pace of it. Even. I have a theater teacher that said, you know, a director's life. He always was smoking a pipe. Ludwig Margulies was a Polish guy, a genius. He was a director. Life is always depend in three questions are the actors sitting? The actors are laying down or the actors are standing up? That's the question. And if you think about it, it's true. It's like the music is like, what is the key and what is the space and what is the intensity?

[00:18:07.790] - Speaker 2
So I mean, if you have a scene where two guys are talking and you have one guy washing the plates, looking, you know, giving the back to the camera, washing to the window, and the other guy is just sitting in the table with the long separation. That tells you a lot of things. The dramatic tension is immediately you read what's going on with these two guys instead of these two guys standing up in front, one to the other, or the two guys sitting in the table, you know, and the distance between them. And if they or one guy is just in a couch and the other guy is what I'm saying, the physical position and the distance in a way that.

[00:18:46.260] - Speaker 3
Tells you so much.

[00:18:47.100] - Speaker 2
Everything. It's like, it's like, so you will direct this and you will say, okay, I want these guys sitting here, and then you will find a kitchen. What kind of kitchen? It will be a wood kitchen and all. What I'm saying is incredible that there is no way to hide. When you see a film, you see who the person is, because all the decisions that are there, every 100,000 decisions that are in one single scene, even when there is no a lot of action, the frame where you put the camera, the amount of light again, the actress or actor that you choose, that who you are and that shows your response to the sensibility. And I can hate it, or I can love it and say, I love. And I think when the musicians arrive to your studio in the moment that guy arrived and gave you a chord of the guitar and said, ah, that's it. And then maybe there's other ones that you hear. One album and I always had an album in 30s, you know, where, where, where hands you are in notes.

[00:19:43.330] - Speaker 2
I mean, you know, you a wine, you don't have to drink the bottle. You just sip and they say, oh my God, I feel.

[00:19:49.170] - Speaker 3
Like sometimes you can hear it in the first two notes. That's great. No, it's a crazy thing to say, I agree.

[00:19:55.530] - Speaker 4
But for you.

[00:19:56.010] - Speaker 3
Yes, it feels it feels almost like an energetic reaction. Like I'll hear something. And the way it comes in, either I lean forward or I lean back.

[00:20:12.010] - Speaker 2
It's incredible. Right? I agree, I always said to the guys in the, you know, the young filmmakers, I said, the most important thing in a film is the first two minutes and the first two minutes, because in the first two minutes, you know, basically the DNA and the code.

[00:20:29.520] - Speaker 3
And this is for me. Or this is not for them?

[00:20:31.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, in the first two minutes. And that's why the first scene, the first image of anything is so important because is your presentation, is your facade, your you know, if you arrive to a party with a fucking face of you don't like nobody. It's just that first impression it's a lot about. And the music, as you said, two notes. And for you, I know that it's 1 or 2 notes. You will be identified and say, okay, this is for me. It's maybe 20s, but yes, when you hear something and you say.

[00:20:58.600] - Speaker 4
Oh my God.

[00:20:59.080] - Speaker 2
Something, something.

[00:21:00.480] - Speaker 3
And it's not the notes, it's something else.

[00:21:03.160] - Speaker 2
It's something else, right? What is that?

[00:21:05.080] - Speaker 4
I don't know.

[00:21:06.680] - Speaker 2
Nobody will know. I think our brains.

[00:21:09.000] - Speaker 4
I have a I don't think.

[00:21:09.840] - Speaker 3
We can know.

[00:21:11.400] - Speaker 2
I have a big discussion the other day. There's this guy that is called Blaise Agüera, which is basically the guy who is in the artificial intelligence in Google, one of the most smartest guys that I have met. And there was a talk with Lawrence Weschler and him about the AI, which I'm fascinating and I'm very saying where the fucking art is going now with all these Dall-E and all these applications and in music now. I mean, there's going to be a lot of AI music. I don't know what you think about it or what you have been thinking about it. If it will be a good tool, if it will be a good collaborator, if it will be a disruptor or all the above. But but the brain that these guys now are basically all the psychology, all the medicines for psychiatry and mental health issues are designed based on the way a computer works. So there's a great article that a great neuroscientist said, guy's fucking brain does not work like computers. I mean, every in every generation, when when the hydraulic thing was the big thing, they thought that the brain was like hydraulic similar in the industrial thing.

[00:22:24.310] - Speaker 2
They thought that our brain was kind of mechanical now is kind of a digital thing. But this guy was saying, guys, our brain does not store as data. We don't store anything. The fucking computer is storage data, tons of data, memory and then binary kind of relations between 1 and 0. And then they arrive to that. But it's about that our brain does not have nothing about that. If you open the brain of Mozart or Beethoven, you will never find music or any trauma that you have. You will never find it. There is an existent. Nobody knows where the relation between an experience and a sensation is. It is in the body and the brain, the nervous system and that sensation, that repeated trauma or an experience that triggers that or vice versa is a fucking mystery. And this guy said that it will take maybe one 100 years to start to understand, where is that? Where is that emotional thing that what we were talking about? Where is that? Like, what makes that note hits you in a place?

[00:23:28.480] - Speaker 2
And that is the Beatles. Why the Beatles did what they did and why that music is so fucking and why why it speaks to everybody or 90%. What is that? They were not kind of academic musicians. What they what they what happened when I was seeing you talking with Paul McCartney, uh, the the way Paul McCartney drives himself with such a simplicity. And he. This is my perception from seeing your, your, your show, that he does not consider himself a genius in a way. I mean, he just kind of.

[00:24:04.040] - Speaker 4
He's just doing it.

[00:24:05.400] - Speaker 3
He's just doing what he does.

[00:24:06.880] - Speaker 2
Yes. I mean, even he he made me feel as if he actually is not actually giving credit or he actually does not realize how big they are. I mean, he knows, but there's something very liberating.

[00:24:19.480] - Speaker 3
But he knows. He doesn't know how. You know, I don't. I don't think he could feel like if anyone could take credit for it, he could. And I don't think that he feels like he can because it's bigger than him.

[00:24:33.190] - Speaker 2
And do you think that the generations, for example, I mean, talking about like, how these musicians in a way come to that or a film that's only start and you say, where did that come from? And this process of thought, because nobody of us, I think, can plan it or I mean, you cannot control that. There is no formula. There is no nothing. I mean, it's just come from some place. But these musicians today, do you think that differently from the musicians that you work at that time in the 80s or now, that you have all these friends, like from the Beatles, from the 60s and all that? The difference of this consciousness or self-consciousness that these musicians are now exposed to so much millions of social media and they are their own entrepreneur and all that. Do you think that has changed the way of creating or not necessarily.

[00:25:22.580] - Speaker 3
I would say technology has definitely changed it. So in so many young artists, don't play a physical instrument anymore. They're programmers. And the difference between the virtual version and the physical version in the room seem to be different to me. I'm not even saying one is better than the other. I love Kraftwerk, they use machines, you know, it's, uh, when I hear Kraftwerk, I'm hearing their point of view. And with all the musicians that I love, I'm hearing their point of view. And I don't think I has a point of view. Like you said, if you had the same script, you could make 500 different movies. I don't think that I can do that. I heard something on a on a business podcast. It was very interesting saying, if all of the AI's that are the different AI companies that are competing with each other start with the same database, which is basically everything that's on the web.

[00:26:25.010] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[00:26:26.490] - Speaker 3
As they get better and better. When you ask any one of them a question, they'll all spit out the same answer. That's not true in art.

[00:26:38.290] - Speaker 2
I have a friend, Bennett Miller, as a director, which is great. He did Capote and Foxcatcher. He's an amazing director. And then he has just spent almost a year in his.

[00:26:51.010] - Speaker 4
Home.

[00:26:52.810] - Speaker 2
With a program that is called Dall-E. And he started guiding this AI machine, which translates words in images. And you said, I want a cat in a, in a in a Catholic church in the medieval time with a pink sky and a woman crying with a red coat in the Vermeer style, and the fucking thing in 30s give you something like that. Okay, so it's kind of impressive at the same time. Very basic in the beginning. But then he starts trying to crack the code and understand how to get it a little bit more elaborate and more anyway. And now he's doing an exhibition. In the next two weeks, I want to try to jump in in New York with the Gagosian Gallery, because he did this fucking prints. That is like old daguerreotypes with depth of field of an incredible girl of nine years, and it's ghostly and his dress. And imagine that you are seeing a picture from 1894 in Boston. I mean, like or in a river with an indigenous people with a hat and some kind of ghost coming or something.

[00:28:10.760] - Speaker 2
But it's it's literally the texture, the depth. The definition is a daguerreotype kind of thing and big format. I mean, big format, and it's artificial intelligence create. You see the eyes of these people and you swear they exist. These people did not exist, ever. But you feel a melancholy and you feel something happen, and is the memory of something that never existed and is so fascinating for me to say. And I asked him how how you work. It's not that you said, oh, I want a daguerreotype with the nostalgic no. He spent six months kind of the computers that you have to be guiding, editing, stripping out, putting in. And I always said, well, all the synthesizers and all the fucking machines that we count now, they are guided machines. But you need a point of view, and you need an artist to be feeding that and your taste, your sensibility and what is in there and what is not. So he spent that months and you see that work.

[00:29:11.830] - Speaker 2
So nobody will be able to do exactly what he do. So that's what I'm saying. And in the music, I don't know exactly what's going on.

[00:29:18.050] - Speaker 4
I'm curious to see if it will be a.

[00:29:19.570] - Speaker 2
Good collaborator to say, give me a beat like James Brown in the 63 song tall with a little Marvin Gaye bit of power. And maybe it will be a piece of shit, sure, but probably by guiding it little by little and said, you add a fucking Fifth Symphony. Mozart. Blah blah blah. And I don't know if that will be a valid or fucking outrageous thing or not, but I think it's here to stay and it will never be the same. The world. It's going to be this guy.

[00:29:54.090] - Speaker 3
I'm curious to see how it unfolds. I don't know, I don't feel like I know enough.

[00:29:58.370] - Speaker 2
I know I agree. Me neither. But what this guy told me, blaze. He told me, Alejandro. In less than seven years, the world as you know it. It does not exist. Wow. The whole thing.

[00:30:10.490] - Speaker 4
Wow.

[00:30:11.250] - Speaker 3
But I think it's always that way. You know, a new technology comes.

[00:30:15.280] - Speaker 2
But not at the speed that we are living. Because before there was one technology that changed maybe every 100 years. Now you and I have lived in the radio, TV, cell phones, computer, artificial intelligence. Looking at our lifetime, we have changed the world three times. We have seen three times the world.

[00:30:34.280] - Speaker 4
Change.

[00:30:35.000] - Speaker 3
And it's just going to keep speeding up.

[00:30:36.920] - Speaker 2
And our kids, your kid, six year old, he will. The world. I mean, the cell phones for him in seven years will be like that. You remember the bricks? I mean, yeah, you know, so it.

[00:30:46.960] - Speaker 3
Will be embedded in.

[00:30:47.800] - Speaker 4
Us.

[00:30:48.560] - Speaker 2
And those changes were much more. And the impact and the democratic they are now. So according to this guy, this AI thing, um, is going to be something that will really change forever. The thing that maybe, maybe you and I will see.

[00:31:04.760] - Speaker 4
We'll see. We see.

[00:31:07.760] - Speaker 3
Who were the filmmakers that you saw over the course of your life that gave you the permission to do this.

[00:31:18.590] - Speaker 2
I think that the great masters that has, in a way showed us that cinema. It's two a road to explore yourself deeply and share it, which I think is actually subscribed. I mean, it's in the essence of even the first caveman that put their hand full of blood and or paint, and they leave their hands there as a testament of her existence and try to project themselves in some way or in the painting is a tradition that, you know, the painters do an outdoor painter, how you call it a.

[00:32:01.310] - Speaker 4
Self-portrait.

[00:32:02.070] - Speaker 2
A self-portrait, or a memoir or a journal or any any self-reflection that invites you to not only observe exteriorly the world as I have done in all my films, but suddenly there is a moment that you need to go inside and allow yourself to do that. It needs time and it needs. It's a moment in life which I found it at this moment. But the teachers, I think that were the masters that has has showed the way to do it, I think was, uh, Alejandro Jodorowsky, for example, that he really goes deep in the unconsciousness. I think, um, I think it's, uh, Tarkovsky, I think is another great director that everything that you see it belongs to in an interior reflection of a soul, a point there is no nothing more than something clearly interior and obviously Federico Fellini. It's another one that he was capable to laugh about himself and about all his interior demons and contradictions. So just to name. I will say a few. Well, I will say that another master of that is Luis Bunuel, for example.

[00:33:21.970] - Speaker 2
So. Luis Bunuel, for example, is one of my favorite directors, and I think Luis Bunuel. Always was going through this very deep understanding of first, what a kind of. An X-ray of yourself in order to project what you perceive and what you are. Building in reality. So that ability to do that, I think those are I would say. Some of the masters that I.

[00:33:45.810] - Speaker 4
That I remember.

[00:33:46.570] - Speaker 3
When I first saw Bunuel in film school. I took a Bunuel class. So I saw all the, all the Bunuel films, and I remember feeling broken open, like, I feel like this is a new this is a doorway to what's possible. And when I say that, it's not like we can make things like what he made. He's giving us permission.

[00:34:11.000] - Speaker 4
To.

[00:34:11.160] - Speaker 3
Go further than we have seen before.

[00:34:15.720] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[00:34:16.480] - Speaker 2
I think that there has been many examples, you know, uh, um, you know, uh, this Polish director has what was it has, has amazing films that are so profound psychologically or a man with a camera. These Russian films that, you know, is just an exploration of what you are seeing and how it impactful. So what I'm saying, the history of cinema is full of these, uh, you know, and I will say Truffaut too, in a way. Truffaut always he's playing with his own mind and exercising and exploring ideas in cinema, which, you know, is is very intellectual, but at the same time, it's deep in their.

[00:34:58.720] - Speaker 4
Mind, I think.

[00:34:59.360] - Speaker 3
Bergman too.

[00:35:00.360] - Speaker 4
And.

[00:35:01.240] - Speaker 3
In a different.

[00:35:01.840] - Speaker 4
Way, in a different way.

[00:35:03.640] - Speaker 2
But absolutely, I think in persona, you know, persona means in Latin a mascara, a mask, a mask. That's that's the word person. A person or persona is a mask. So suddenly to allow yourself to take out your mask. And because we have this public figure, you are a public figure. You have a public persona. I have a public persona. I'm a persona to everybody. I have a mask. But then we have this intimate private space that we build our life in. And suddenly to take out that. That's what I attempt to explore in, in, in, in, you know, I try to say, okay, whatever you think, this is what really is going inside. And it's a vulnerable place.

[00:35:50.580] - Speaker 4
It's a.

[00:35:50.780] - Speaker 2
Fragile place.

[00:35:51.780] - Speaker 4
It's a scary.

[00:35:52.580] - Speaker 2
One. And it takes time to to really go and try to be the, the possible, honest, the best way and honest way for you to do that. But I found it That incredible, liberating and a privilege and a pleasure to really just go there and take out the mask.

[00:36:11.250] - Speaker 4
Yes.

[00:36:11.970] - Speaker 3
How how is the alignment between your inner self and your outer self?

[00:36:18.490] - Speaker 2
I think depending on who I am, I think I have a way, some mechanisms that are triggered by different circumstances where I can immediately find myself repeating or playing things in a way that every time I have been closer to be conscious about things that I don't like, that I do, or I say, or, you know that is not correct. It's not me as I should be, or I would love to be. And that's what I think. Conscious. In a way, meditation gives you that only you observe yourself. You are a little bit separated, but I think, Thing. Yes, I think I play. I'm a different person sometimes if I am in a in a set. For example, when I'm directing a film, I become so focused and so isolated that I need to. The the process of making something like that, it demands you all your focus and your attention. And suddenly I'm a little detached of the reality. So I that person is not me now. Which I'm completely, you know, fully, you know, here or in a public event where you have 2000 people, you know, listening or a social party.

[00:37:45.640] - Speaker 2
So, yes, I think in a way we all have different persons based.

[00:37:50.960] - Speaker 3
On the condition.

[00:37:52.040] - Speaker 2
I love this. I think it was Orson Welles, uh, that he said something very, very wise and funny that says everything that has been said about me at some point is true.

[00:38:08.070] - Speaker 4
That's great in.

[00:38:08.950] - Speaker 2
A way that yeah, yeah, this guy is an asshole. Yes. That Tuesday at 6 p.m., I was maybe an asshole. Oh, this guy is so wonderful and generous. Yes. That Saturday, I give a big tip to that guy. And I was in a good mood. And you know what I'm saying is, the perception of our persona is so fractured and fragmented, depending in which day and who experience and where you were you. That is almost impossible to to not have probably this kind of multi fractured thing. Am I.

[00:38:38.110] - Speaker 4
Right or.

[00:38:38.830] - Speaker 3
Absolutely, absolutely. It's just the nature. I always made it a point when I would meet an artist. Let's say an artist was on tour. Um, and they were, I can remember the one not long ago where the artist was playing at Hollywood Bowl, and they asked me to come backstage after the show to meet with them, and I refused, and I really want to meet with them. But imagine your state of mind after coming off stage with 20,000 people screaming, how grounded will the conversation be? How present can the person be? And and I want to see who they really are, not who they are right after 20,000 people. Because that's a completely unrealistic, uh, it's an unrealistic situation to be in for anybody being in front of 20,000 people and 20,000 people listening to you and cheering for you.

[00:39:34.420] - Speaker 2
It's funny that you mentioned that because one of my I'm a super fan of Thom Yorke, right? And I was was I was here in a concert in LA like 3 or 4 years ago. And uh, and I think it was Paul Thomas Anderson who was, who invited me to go to the backstage, um, to meet And obviously I would love to meet Thom Yorke, but exactly because the same reason you have just said I rejected the.

[00:40:06.610] - Speaker 4
Idea and.

[00:40:07.490] - Speaker 2
My son was with me. My son is a musician and he said, dad, I said, I don't want to meet him in this circumstance because I know how he feels in a way, I'm not a rock concert, but I know that when you have a public event, your mind is rambling yourself.

[00:40:21.850] - Speaker 4
You are not yourself yourself.

[00:40:24.210] - Speaker 2
It's funny. And then I regret and I but then listen to you, I said I felt it. I know that people is not in their minds. So that's why you said how aligned.

[00:40:34.530] - Speaker 3
In my case, it wasn't a rule. I just the first time that it happens. Like it was a feeling. Just this doesn't feel right. I know this person isn't going to be themselves. And I want and I really want to see who they are. And this is a chance to this would undermine that.

[00:40:51.290] - Speaker 2
How how what kind of circumstances make Feel that you are not in that state. I mean, have you had this? I mean, is in a concert or different artists or different environments make you feel that you are not Rick Rubin as you would like to be or the one that you want to be, and that gives you kind of a different persona.

[00:41:16.200] - Speaker 3
I would say if I went out to dinner with more than four people, I would not be comfortable. I feel like I couldn't be myself. I can remember going to a dinner with maybe 20 people, with a friend that they were invited to, and they invited me to come. And I remember sitting at the table, and I ended up hurting my back at the dinner because I was trying to shrink myself to become invisible, because I was so uncomfortable.

[00:41:44.200] - Speaker 4
And uncomfortable.

[00:41:45.000] - Speaker 3
With that many people.

[00:41:46.600] - Speaker 2
And his nervousness or.

[00:41:48.160] - Speaker 4
What you.

[00:41:48.560] - Speaker 3
Feel? I don't know how to describe it.

[00:41:50.200] - Speaker 4
Yeah, it's just like.

[00:41:50.880] - Speaker 2
You feel.

[00:41:51.280] - Speaker 4
Fragmented because I.

[00:41:52.360] - Speaker 3
Feel like when I'm with someone, when I'm talking to you. We're we're connected to each other. And I feel like what you're saying and what I'm saying are directly related to the fact that we're here together. Yeah. And when there's 20 people, it's. You don't have that feeling. You don't have that sense of connection, and I, I love that. Um, and and I'll say also, even in a one on one situation, until there's a sense of some thread of common ground on anything, it's really awkward for me just because I feel crazy. You know, I feel like I don't relate to how.

[00:42:31.580] - Speaker 4
People relate to the.

[00:42:32.380] - Speaker 3
World.

[00:42:33.540] - Speaker 2
I completely understand. I becoming that way too. I think that these dinners, you know, these these dinners of more than 8 or 8 people for me is kind of the maximum. And now, as you said, four is perfect. I can handle four, six people, like two couples more. My wife and I and two couples. That's more than enough to enjoy it.

[00:42:53.290] - Speaker 4
Yes.

[00:42:53.970] - Speaker 2
And to get something about it. To grow, to whatever, to get to get like this.

[00:42:59.050] - Speaker 4
And just.

[00:42:59.650] - Speaker 3
Waste time.

[00:43:00.730] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[00:43:01.370] - Speaker 2
And, you know, maybe it's the age because I now I, I need to understand that I don't need to spend time with people that I don't, that I don't want to spend time with.

[00:43:12.410] - Speaker 4
Absolutely.

[00:43:13.170] - Speaker 3
Same here. And I think we're both, uh, 1963 people. Yes.

[00:43:18.170] - Speaker 4
Which. Which one? Three.

[00:43:19.290] - Speaker 3
I'm in March. Which they? March 10th. So. Friday.

[00:43:22.930] - Speaker 4
Wow. 60. Yeah. Wow.

[00:43:25.170] - Speaker 3
And what's interesting?

[00:43:26.010] - Speaker 4
How you feel. How you feel. Fine.

[00:43:28.330] - Speaker 2
No, no. No thoughts? No. Like. Oh.

[00:43:30.290] - Speaker 3
Holy shit. I usually don't think about numbers. So when you say it, it's like, wow, that's interesting. But I don't think in in those terms.

[00:43:37.410] - Speaker 2
I have never been hit by any decade, you know, the 30s, 40s, 50s. This is the first time and maybe because many things have been aligned with this in a funny way, you know, I have just finished a movie and it's a very personal movie and the classic baby blues that when you finish something, you know there's a space that is left and that space has to be filled. So I have been here many times, but anyway, there's a space and I'm trying to understand again who I am after a movie that I was so busy mentally and physically. And now is this ordinary time. Okay, let me let me find myself again who I am.

[00:44:15.040] - Speaker 4
It's very strange. It's happened to you. When?

[00:44:17.600] - Speaker 3
Absolutely, absolutely. I start producing my life. Like when I. If I'm not creatively producing in the studio, I get home and start moving the furniture around. And I'm very. I need to keep myself occupied.

[00:44:30.680] - Speaker 2
So in a way, you never have emptiness.

[00:44:33.000] - Speaker 3
I do, because sometimes everything sort of finishes. But for the most part, I like the idea that there are many balls in the air because the fun for me, the fun part is like solving the problem of it. Cracking the code of making something new is so exciting. I love it and it could be with an artist. It could be with my favorite artist. It could be with an artist that I don't listen to. But hearing what they want, what they're hoping to accomplish and listening to it and listening to what's going on inside myself and helping them find the best version of themselves. And it's really fun.

[00:45:08.870] - Speaker 4
That's fantastic.

[00:45:10.390] - Speaker 2
That's fantastic. And, uh, and I think that, well, talking about age that I was telling you about, that it's the first time for me it's different because I have a kind of a a process where differently from yours, so differently from yours. I suddenly find myself, um, inside a project where I cannot leave. I can I need to to to to work 24 hours, days and years.

[00:45:47.470] - Speaker 4
In obsessively, obsessively.

[00:45:50.340] - Speaker 2
Which sometimes can turn wrong or right. And, you know, it can be either way, but not necessarily a pleasant one, you know. Understood. And now, hearing you in a way.

[00:46:01.740] - Speaker 3
But I'm not saying it's right.

[00:46:03.180] - Speaker 4
No, no, I'm saying.

[00:46:04.060] - Speaker 3
It's right for.

[00:46:04.580] - Speaker 4
Me. Exactly.

[00:46:05.700] - Speaker 3
But and I would say, whatever you're doing, do it.

[00:46:09.820] - Speaker 4
It's working.

[00:46:11.060] - Speaker 2
No, I think it's working. That's what I'm saying. It sometimes can be right or wrong. A film can be better or not, or people can like it or not. The results, honestly, is something that you don't control. So I try to avoid thinking about it honestly. I mean, I hate when people say no because.

[00:46:27.020] - Speaker 4
Honestly, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

[00:46:30.260] - Speaker 2
And especially it doesn't matter. Because even if it matters, you cannot do nothing.

[00:46:34.300] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[00:46:35.060] - Speaker 3
But accepting that you have no control gives you the confidence to make the thing you want to make.

[00:46:41.020] - Speaker 2
Exactly. So anyway, I bought the right or wrong is not about that is that I find myself obsessively with one thing to make it, let's say perfect, which doesn't exist. And then when it finished, there's a big boy, you know, as big as the project.

[00:46:59.930] - Speaker 4
Absolutely.

[00:47:00.730] - Speaker 2
So that's where I am now. And so that's why the 60s with that. And then my son Eliseo has just go to London. He's doing music, by the way. And now, now is the empty nest kind of moment.

[00:47:14.530] - Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah. You know.

[00:47:15.290] - Speaker 3
I'm surprised you didn't do music.

[00:47:16.610] - Speaker 4
Instead of film.

[00:47:17.330] - Speaker 2
Envy you guys so much because it's like, yeah, I mean, musicians, I always said, you are flying and we are crawling in our fogging cameras, but my, my big joy in life is here music. Because, I mean, there's nothing more I can enjoy more in my life. I mean.

[00:47:32.610] - Speaker 3
It takes me away. I close my eyes and I'm in the music.

[00:47:37.730] - Speaker 4
I love it.

[00:47:38.450] - Speaker 2
The thing is that I always said, it hits you and you don't have to intellectualize. It's. And the body doesn't lie. So when the frequencies hit your ear and your body you are, there is presence and there is no lie, no intellectualization. And it's it's it's just so tough. Again, it's because you don't think. And that's what I think is the reality is the unconscious is trigger and memories and all that is. And I think that the joy of music is, I think compared to the cinema is, is nothing.

[00:48:13.310] - Speaker 4
But I feel.

[00:48:13.750] - Speaker 3
That in your in your work it feels like it's images but it's music. It's not. You're not telling us too much. You're not telling us what to think. You're inviting us to participate in this experience. That's how I, I feel it.

[00:48:31.790] - Speaker 4
And I think.

[00:48:32.990] - Speaker 2
The the way I approach films musically is, is very musical because I always when I'm writing a film, I'm listening to the same album over and over again. So I need to understand how a film sounds and what is the kind of a genre. If it's like Amores Perros? My first film was like a like a Sticky fingers on rolling. It was like gritty and raw and rocky.

[00:48:57.700] - Speaker 3
Does the score end up being similar to the music or.

[00:49:00.060] - Speaker 4
Not necessarily.

[00:49:00.740] - Speaker 2
Necessarily. It's just the texture of some particular album ends up being kind of something that I need to understand for, you know, like.

[00:49:10.260] - Speaker 4
It goes with that. It goes, it goes.

[00:49:12.300] - Speaker 3
Whether that's the music used or.

[00:49:13.740] - Speaker 4
Not.

[00:49:14.380] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It's not the music that I would use or even the score. It's just I need to understand that the skin, the texture of that in the musically and rhythmically and then because I think when we born the first thing, the first thing we hear when we born is a beat, right? It's our heartbeat is the fucking drum beat. That's the first thing we come.

[00:49:38.140] - Speaker 4
To like, probably.

[00:49:38.980] - Speaker 3
Our mom's heartbeat first.

[00:49:40.540] - Speaker 2
Exactly, exactly. Than ours. So now you have a fucking drum beat. Now, in synchronize or in harmony or not? And then the last thing we end up hearing in our bed. If we are lucky enough to die a peaceful death is the last drum is when we go. And so our life is defined by a beat or a drum beat or a heartbeat and a rhythm. And, and I think that has to do a lot with the way we conceive things. So I try always to understand what is that heartbeat or what is that drum beat that will define the rhythm of that. Because rhythm is God. I mean, without rhythm there's nothing there's no architecture, there's no universe, there's no nothing. So yes, I try that. Birdman was like a thing that I need to find. And I invite, uh, you know, uh, my friend Antonio to play the drums, and we he he he played it, and I have all these tracks and.

[00:50:40.810] - Speaker 4
Even I play.

[00:50:41.760] - Speaker 3
Play watching the movie or. No, no, he played first.

[00:50:44.400] - Speaker 2
I asked him to say, you know, Antonio Antonio Sanchez. I said, let's go to the studio. So we went to a studio in New York, and I was kind of reading this thing and said, okay, this is a moment.

[00:50:53.880] - Speaker 4
That script is done.

[00:50:55.120] - Speaker 2
The script is done. So and I kind of knew because, again, I have a good musical ideas and I have a good ear, but I'm a terrible player. And so I knew exactly kind of the things that I wanted in terms of, let's say, beats or rhythm or, you know, speed. So I was describing him, you know, this is a scene that he will arrive and his daughter is there and they start discussing. So he has to be grown. So he was like, okay, what about this, dad? I said, okay, the sinkopa or, you know, let's go a little bit more funky or a little bit more jazzy. So he was incredibly he's an incredible, incredible drummer. And he was. So we were doing tracks and I was just imagining how the actor would be and how the camera would be moving behind because it was continuous movement. Continuous rhythm. And those tracks were incredibly. It was the blood of the of the film movement.

[00:51:51.350] - Speaker 4
And listen to it.

[00:51:52.390] - Speaker 3
On the set when you were.

[00:51:53.950] - Speaker 4
Filming.

[00:51:54.470] - Speaker 2
Sometimes when I need it, I said to the actors, to Edward North or these guys, okay, look at this. This is going to be here. So it's like, you know, so it was helpful for them to understand the pace and for the camera. And that's what I'm saying. So that film was very, very musical.

[00:52:10.070] - Speaker 3
Had there ever been a film before with just a drum score?

[00:52:15.230] - Speaker 2
Not that I know. Not that I know maybe. Yes. You know.

[00:52:18.510] - Speaker 4
Film is.

[00:52:19.070] - Speaker 3
So radical. It's so.

[00:52:22.430] - Speaker 4
Radical, but it's so and.

[00:52:24.270] - Speaker 3
It's loud.

[00:52:25.270] - Speaker 4
But you know.

[00:52:25.710] - Speaker 2
What? You know, I remember that the academy members of the, the, you know, the Oscars and the Academy members, they did not consider that was a score. And I said, guys, so you are telling me the that drums are minor than a guitar or a piano? This is a fucking instrument. And it has. But it was funny that they considered that like, okay, it's drums, it's not a symphony or whatever.

[00:52:50.020] - Speaker 4
Well, in.

[00:52:50.420] - Speaker 3
The old days of hip hop music, when I started doing hip hop music, the powers that be didn't acknowledge it as music.

[00:52:56.860] - Speaker 4
The hip hop. Yeah.

[00:52:58.140] - Speaker 2
So they thought, oh, this is just beats.

[00:53:00.300] - Speaker 4
They don't even.

[00:53:00.740] - Speaker 3
Know what it is. It's like, why do people like it? It's not music. That was the conversation.

[00:53:07.500] - Speaker 2
But that was in the 70s. Now we are in the 2020s. And it was it was the same kind of like.

[00:53:13.820] - Speaker 4
Yeah, the arrogance.

[00:53:15.700] - Speaker 3
The small mindedness of thinking they knew what music was.

[00:53:20.420] - Speaker 2
And the same. I remember, you know, there's an anecdote of Gustavo Santaolalla, which is my friend, and he did the music for for the first four films of mine. And Gustavo doesn't read music. He's out to the didactic, but he's one of the best musicians because wherever he played the finger in, in a ronroco, in a guitar or whatever. He composes. Just beautiful and spacey and musical. But but he is not an academic, you know. Beautiful. And there was this kind of youth that he played in Babel, and it was a couple of notes. Dong dong dong dong dong. And again, the guys struggled so much to accept his nomination because it was like, wow, this guy is not a musician. There is no score. There is no violins, there's no orchestra. So it was like, if it was a minor expression when I said it's not about the amount of instruments. And if a horn or a violin is superior to a drums, I mean, you know what I mean.

[00:54:17.610] - Speaker 2
Again, this, this exclusion or, you know, perceptions of.

[00:54:23.090] - Speaker 3
One of the things that you said earlier, Gustavo was helping me on my project. No.

[00:54:26.970] - Speaker 4
Yes. Whoa. That's fantastic.

[00:54:29.410] - Speaker 2
He's amazing. Right? I mean, he's incredible, but he told me. I will not say the name. One of the most, you know, he said that he was so excited to arrive to this dinner of the Academy Awards, and he saw one of these very venerated musicians, old Guy, with all the awards in the world, and he didn't even give the hand to him. He was like, oh, I love your work. And the guy didn't give the hand to him. Like saying, you are not a musician. Wow. And I said, wow. You know, that's that's so sad.

[00:55:02.630] - Speaker 4
It's sad and funny.

[00:55:04.750] - Speaker 3
For sad for them. Not for him. Not not for Gustavo. For Gustavo. It's funny. It's sad for the person who refuses to shake somebody's hand.

[00:55:13.510] - Speaker 4
Exactly. But, but, but I feel.

[00:55:15.230] - Speaker 2
That, you know, every instrument, right? Is so powerful again. Like. Like that discussion of Thich Nhat Hanh and and the and the Nobel Prize of Korean that about the dignity or the consciousness of a plant or a human. Why a human is bigger than a tiger or something. I mean, it's ridiculous, you know?

[00:55:34.380] - Speaker 4
Ridiculous, right? Absolutely.

[00:55:36.860] - Speaker 3
So you mentioned earlier that you made Birdman in 19 days. Now, looking back, if you had all the money in the world and forever to shoot it, would it be a better film?

[00:55:49.460] - Speaker 2
No. I think the restrictions that I had were so important. I mean, I have to say that the script started getting tighter and tighter because the need and I started getting out all what it was not absolutely necessary. There is a moment that is dangerous. I remember that there was kind of a moment that even with a very restricted budget and the the film got to a place that it was what it is now, but there was like $1 million that was out of budget. And I remember one of the studio told me, Alejandro, what about if you take out the flying scene, for example? So then you will save that. And I said, oh fucking God. This is what it's about. So just for you to understand that if you don't know what the film is about or if you're a director, that is, you are vulnerable or you don't understand rightly, what? Where are the fights to be? Fight that you have to fight. It can be destroyed. I mean, it can be destroyed.

[00:56:48.210] - Speaker 2
So the limits of what is necessary is delicate because you can sometimes.

[00:56:53.050] - Speaker 4
Strip out something.

[00:56:53.810] - Speaker 3
As long as you know what it is.

[00:56:55.290] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[00:56:55.770] - Speaker 2
But it was laughable for me to say to to this person, you know, you don't understand what the film. So by saving 1 million, that film will be destroyed, will not exist. So but at the end, I have to recognize that, um, yes. I think restrictions creatively are very healthy. I really learned a big lesson there because to have all the freedom and all the money, normally I will say something in the Renaissance where all these Renaissance painters were there, they have patrons, which was unfortunately the church that was they were just painting church things. I would have loved to see all these guys painting ordinary Life at that time, but they didn't. But the restrictions and the timing and the budgets were very constrained. They were kind of they were, in a way, employees with tight bark.

[00:57:46.240] - Speaker 4
Yeah.

[00:57:46.640] - Speaker 2
And, and and they flew and they, they were restricted as hell with limits and things. Not necessarily smart sometimes, but that made them and they recognize them. They, they, they could not conceive to be free and with all the budget. And it's about me know they were doing things for God.

[00:58:06.560] - Speaker 4
Yes.

[00:58:07.480] - Speaker 2
And you know, they were not important. Yes. And they were restricted. Restricted. And look what they did. I mean.

[00:58:14.680] - Speaker 4
Amazing.

[00:58:15.200] - Speaker 2
So I think I think every artist needs a little bit of that. And I guess that you as a producer, you do that with musicians, right?

[00:58:22.080] - Speaker 4
I mean, you you have.

[00:58:22.920] - Speaker 2
To restrict.

[00:58:23.520] - Speaker 4
Sometimes.

[00:58:24.200] - Speaker 3
Absolutely. I believe less is more. You know, I like the least amount of Amount of information to get an idea across. Usually sounds the best and carries the most emotion. If you have one guitar. If you have Gustavo playing his guitar, that's got an emotion in what he plays, the simplest thing. If you have 20 people playing guitar together in unison, it's like a wall of sound. There's no. It's the part. You may understand the part better from that, but you don't have the feeling of the connection to the music. You don't hear the fingers, you don't hear the personality of the player. It's just the melody.

[00:59:05.470] - Speaker 4
I agree.

[00:59:05.910] - Speaker 3
It's one of the things we do in the recording studio in like, it's not uncommon in a chorus to double the lead vocal. And what happens when you double a lead vocal? It reinforces the melody and it sometimes can make the words seem less important. It's like a it's a balance.

[00:59:28.660] - Speaker 4
I agree.

[00:59:29.340] - Speaker 2
I agree with you. And what you are saying is funny because I've seen so many great musicians that start with the first or second album and are really in this space where it's about their voices, the lyrics, the that the needed thing, and then they start being produced, wrongly produced and overproduced. And that's the tragedy. I mean, how many? No, I mean, I've seen so many people over produce that suddenly it's about everything but about. And that happens a lot.

[01:00:02.220] - Speaker 3
Absolutely. And now technology has changed where when I first started, there was 24 track recordings, so you couldn't have more than 24 tracks of music unless you had two big machines, which not a lot of people had, and then you were limited to 48. And and in one of the studios I worked at, we only had 16 tracks and some studios. We would take the 16 track machine and put an eight track head on it, because you only had eight, but they sounded better than the 16 because it's like going up in resolution in your film. You know, you have more.

[01:00:34.560] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[01:00:35.200] - Speaker 3
You're using a bigger footprint of the information. I remember I would sometimes print the same track when I had 24 tracks on my first recordings. I might put the kick drum on six of the 24 tracks, even though it's just the same kick drum. But sometimes when you mix them together, you could get it to sound more powerful. Um, but it was always just like trial and error. Try to find what makes it sound louder, what makes it sound more original, what makes it sound crazier.

[01:01:08.880] - Speaker 2
And what is it scary now for me too, in the music that I hear a lot, is that everybody's sounding the same, don't you think?

[01:01:15.600] - Speaker 4
I mean, they use.

[01:01:16.200] - Speaker 3
The same software and it's, uh. So now what? I to finish the point about how many tracks do you have now? With Pro Tools? You have infinite.

[01:01:27.630] - Speaker 4
Tracks. Infinite.

[01:01:29.230] - Speaker 3
So there's no reason to think in terms of conserving because it's free. I can just do another one. I could just do another. I could just add more. I could add more. And then you start having hundreds of tracks and.

[01:01:41.750] - Speaker 2
Fixing it and editing. And then it lost the whole thing.

[01:01:45.870] - Speaker 4
Yeah.

[01:01:46.190] - Speaker 3
All the humanity goes out of it.

[01:01:47.630] - Speaker 2
That's in the film industry, for example, in our self. I used to edit still like in in tracks and to edit was a very difficult thing. Now obviously with, with with the technology and the Abbey again give you 1000 possibilities in one second or color correction, for example, I will put you the classic as you arrive to do the color correction of a scene, and you can really the contrast, the highlights, the bluest, the pale, the and you can easily fuck it up. The whole thing. I mean by by doing it. If you spend too much time, then then you get lost and the I get lost, and then you don't know anywhere where you are. And then you arrive the next day and said, am I an idiot? What I was I mean, it's so easy to get into trouble. I mean, what I'm saying is having all the freedom and all the choices, I think is the most difficult thing, much more difficult than to have the restrictions.

[01:02:44.620] - Speaker 2
And I will say this, I always say this to the young filmmaker, said, you have to have a principle, not rules. I hate rules because rules seems like restrictive. But for example, the principle of Birdman was very clear. It was his one take and the restrictions were very clear. So there was no way to get out of those principles. I cannot, and that principle saved my ass, because then I had to solve things in this principle, and it's fun. It's like the rules of the game. If there is no rule, then there's no game. Yeah. So that that principle of a game it's. And I see now a lot of.

[01:03:21.140] - Speaker 4
I.

[01:03:21.450] - Speaker 2
Will say albums or films that without that not a lot of budget or not a lot.

[01:03:27.610] - Speaker 3
They don't. They don't have a point of view. It's just like a smorgasbord.

[01:03:31.970] - Speaker 2
That's the thing. And I what I see in the music is like what you were saying about the voices. Like, there's great singers and. But they just sound the same. And and and and the and the. You know, I remember the time of the D7. You remember the Yamaha D7 or all the things that were in the, in the. But now every single sound, like I said, can they feel that they, they, they sound exactly the same as the other person that some.

[01:03:58.530] - Speaker 3
Of them want to. Some of them think, oh, that's what works.

[01:04:01.410] - Speaker 4
That's what.

[01:04:02.330] - Speaker 3
Some of them really.

[01:04:03.090] - Speaker 4
Like. Yeah.

[01:04:03.610] - Speaker 3
This is, this is the sometimes, sometimes like, this is the sound. This is the sound now. And I've always been I always feel like that's the sound now that's the last thing.

[01:04:12.890] - Speaker 4
I want to do.

[01:04:13.530] - Speaker 2
Exactly, exactly. Can you imagine all these young guys will be trying to find their own sound. It will be amazing. And that's what I found. Sometimes when I feel or hear some fearless musicians, uh, in the London scene, for example, there's this jazz guys that are trying a lot of things that are these cats that are like saying, wow, these guys are sounding now with kind of a mix of the old jazz with maybe old microphones, but with the little synth that is now super cool. You know, that's where suddenly I found incredible combinations. But it's hard to find.

[01:04:48.240] - Speaker 3
What do they call the comets? Is that the name of the group something?

[01:04:50.680] - Speaker 4
No, no, no. Is that the one?

[01:04:52.040] - Speaker 2
No no no no no I.

[01:04:54.800] - Speaker 4
Can't remember.

[01:04:55.280] - Speaker 3
The name. There's a there's a, there's a jazz group now that's like. It's more like a collective. I can't remember their name, but there's a collective and then there's all the offshoots, but they're like the happening jazz guys in London now. It's supposed to be incredible.

[01:05:08.080] - Speaker 4
That's.

[01:05:08.480] - Speaker 2
I think that's where there's a freedom. But they don't care about, you know, the Grammys and the, you know, all that all that thing. You know what I mean? I think that's that's the theory now about how many likes you have or how many followers and all that shit, but I think there's a lot of things happening, I have to say.

[01:05:25.150] - Speaker 3
How how surprised are you, um, in the success you've had?

[01:05:32.270] - Speaker 4
I will say that, uh.

[01:05:35.150] - Speaker 2
The first thing that I felt when I did Amores Perros was super surprising, because I never expect that film will be will be as successful as it was. It was a dogfight film with a crash, and it was very in Spanish and no stars. And and actually, it was a film that was rejected in the Cannes Film Festival competition. And they said, it's too long. It was three hours long and it's too violent and nobody wants to see it. And then we end up in this kind of other smaller kind of venue in Cannes, and we won. That was the best again, the best thing that could happen was that we were not accepted in the competition, in the official competition, and then in the semana de la critique, which is not even an official kind of section. We were accepted and we won. And then from there we we started kind of really, really having a lot of success in every festival. We won the awards. Like we want like 160 awards in the world.

[01:06:31.500] - Speaker 2
I mean, it was kind of a crazy and honestly, and I tell you this seriously, I not only did not expect it, but actually when I was receiving praise or I felt that journalist wants to interview me and all that, I have kind of a section in the New York Times Magazine inside that was like a big deal. Naively, innocently, innocently, I thought that, you know, most of the directors, because at that time, again, there was no many films being produced as now. I thought, you know, everybody will have a share of a little fame, and I'm just going into a normal 15 minutes. Yeah, exactly.

[01:07:14.620] - Speaker 4
Which I said.

[01:07:15.680] - Speaker 2
I think will be kind of normal that you are getting interviewed by this magazine or that you get a good review. I said, well, for me it was kind of a normal, not normal, but I didn't expect that it can go absolutely wrong and it could be completely different.

[01:07:30.080] - Speaker 4
Yeah.

[01:07:30.440] - Speaker 3
And it could have. And the next one could have, it could have.

[01:07:33.800] - Speaker 4
Every.

[01:07:34.160] - Speaker 2
Time can be bad. And I have had bad experience. But in a way I was naively taken by surprise. And I'm glad and I, my father and you will see this scene in in in Bardo. My father had a very, very particular relation with success because he never had success. And at the same time his theory, which was very well intentioned, not, I don't know, the execution, but when my father saw somebody doing something right or good or excellent, he never praise you. Never. And the reason was that he said that when you pray praise somebody, you will hurt him and you will in a way help him to believe or be self conscious. And then he will start not doing that and you will damage. So for example, I have a niece, a nephew that was incredible in football. He was like eight years old and he was a fucking rock star. And my father loved football. He never said to him something nice said, why? And then he told me this story.

[01:08:38.310] - Speaker 2
So my father never praised me about nothing, ever. He was very kind and nice, but he was never. He deliberately did that.

[01:08:47.750] - Speaker 4
And he.

[01:08:48.310] - Speaker 3
Thought he was protecting you.

[01:08:49.670] - Speaker 2
Protecting me. And at the same time, in the Catholic thing, to be successful and especially in Hollywood, is an open door to lose your soul. And it's almost like a pride scene. So people that are successful can lose their own minds. First of all, you can lose success, so.

[01:09:11.670] - Speaker 4
It's.

[01:09:12.030] - Speaker 2
A possible way to lose something, or you can lose your soul because then you will have a lot of pride, and then you will be tempted by a lot of things that are wrong. So in my upbringing and my conception have success was very contradictory because it was something that you want to have. You wish you would like to be appreciated, you would like to be successful at every normal human being. But once you have it, you have to feel fear to lose it. Fear to be tempted, fear to to all those restrictions and guilt. So I navigate that. And my father had a line that always repeated that. That is Zimbardo that says, um, remember that to success. He said in Spanish, I will do my best translation. Remember to success. Give it a sip. You know, taste it, give it a sip. Do do the.

[01:10:06.820] - Speaker 3
Gargle.

[01:10:07.260] - Speaker 4
Gargle.

[01:10:08.140] - Speaker 2
And then spit it because if not, it will poison.

[01:10:11.610] - Speaker 4
You. Yes.

[01:10:12.330] - Speaker 2
So my father always I mean, he was.

[01:10:14.370] - Speaker 4
Obsessed with it.

[01:10:15.650] - Speaker 2
And my father said that the worst thing that he see in human beings is when they were successful, there was a football player that was very successful that went to Spain and he won like five, blah, blah, blah. And he always spoke in third person of himself.

[01:10:29.570] - Speaker 4
And my father.

[01:10:30.130] - Speaker 2
Said, when somebody starts speaking in third person, they lose their mind. You never want to be that anyway. So in a way, my father despised so much success that he impregnated me. Always a fear. And I always was, I will say, conscious of never believe it. So if you ask me, I will say the first success that I have took me by surprise, because ignorance and naiveness or innocence. And then, as I have been sometimes more successful and, you know, uh, I always remember that I tried to really put my feet on the ground and never I have never believed it. I, I.

[01:11:09.200] - Speaker 6
I have.

[01:11:10.240] - Speaker 2
The imposter syndrome.

[01:11:11.480] - Speaker 4
Let me put it that way. Yes, yes, yes, I believe it.

[01:11:14.560] - Speaker 2
Have you had the imposter syndrome?

[01:11:16.200] - Speaker 3
I don't know if I've had imposter syndrome, but I'm always surprised when anything successful. I don't expect it. Ever. Oh, I never expect it, because I know that's not in my control. Oh, oh, there's so many things have to go right for something to be successful that all happen after I say, okay, let's put it into the world.

[01:11:34.600] - Speaker 4
And then you.

[01:11:35.080] - Speaker 2
Have a surprise.

[01:11:36.240] - Speaker 4
Yeah.

[01:11:36.520] - Speaker 3
Then whatever happens, happens. And usually I'm making something else by that time anyway. And I don't even look back.

[01:11:41.120] - Speaker 4
And let me.

[01:11:41.920] - Speaker 2
Let me ask you and be honest with this. When there's a disappointment, disappointing result of something that you love so much and you put a lot of energy or life or whatever that you love, and there's a disappointing or the reviews. I don't know if the music, how the reviews are, if they are really cruel or they are tough, or have you been exposed to bad reviews or critics and.

[01:12:06.360] - Speaker 3
Absolutely. And now. I wrote this book. First time I wrote a book, and I worked on it for eight years, and it's the first thing I've ever put out with my name on the front, because usually my name is on the back, the artist name is on the front, so it's more personal than usual.

[01:12:21.910] - Speaker 2
You're exposing.

[01:12:22.710] - Speaker 4
Now yourself.

[01:12:23.190] - Speaker 3
Absolutely. And and I'll say it's more personal, even though I don't talk about myself at all in the book, it's personal in that it's how I see the world. It's my it's very much my perspective. And, um, and I read a many reviews, some very good, many very good and some bad. And when I read the bad ones, I just laugh because it's so it's clear the book's not for them. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like, I don't think everything is for everybody. So there's one person who's saying, you know, I'll read this book every day for the rest of my life and someone else will say, this is nonsense. Like, this is I want my money back. And and I love that. And one of the things I say in the book is that the best art divides the audience. It's like if everyone likes it. Yeah, you didn't go far enough. If you really are walking the tightrope, there's going to be a bunch of people who love it and a bunch of people who hate it or don't get it.

[01:13:27.970] - Speaker 3
Otherwise it's conventional, probably, or middle of the road.

[01:13:34.610] - Speaker 2
And and did you did you read the good and the bad reviews?

[01:13:38.530] - Speaker 4
You get it all.

[01:13:39.610] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And and but in the albums, for example, has been an album that you put your soul with an artist and suddenly it was not, as you expect the result. And it it you feel sadness.

[01:13:51.610] - Speaker 3
I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think it's more just this like, wow, that's how they heard it. That's interesting.

[01:14:02.450] - Speaker 2
And then the next.

[01:14:03.250] - Speaker 4
That's it.

[01:14:03.970] - Speaker 3
Yeah. I'm always on to the next.

[01:14:06.800] - Speaker 2
I think that's the wise thing. I think I learned, I think especially in funny enough in this film that you will see I, I open myself and that that's the first film that I have done with. I always say that I have done the other films with my eyes open, and this one, I did it with my eyes closed. So I look inside and I took out what I saw. And what I felt that was again, is not at all biographical because who cares about my life? Even I don't care. So why the people? But there's like very particular, uh, things that I have felt that I have reflected, that I remember that in a way went through my life that has been emotional events that I fictionalize, but in a way is a trace of things that, in a way, are very close to me. And the way I see the world and the way I feel the world, the way I experience, the way there's a navigation of themes like life or death or fear or doubt or parenthood or adolescence or or or dementia or to lost somebody, or all the art and love and, you know, so there is no stories.

[01:15:29.510] - Speaker 2
It's just a walk in the consciousness, a walk in, in, in the dream of somebody in a very particular state of mind that you will see. So, so, so the first reaction of people sometimes was like, where is the story? Where is the beef? I mean, there was not rational to, to, to grab from, you know, like if you are looking for a plot point or a first act, second act, there was nothing of that. I was just exploring, trying to be some some The sound and sight experience to fly with the consciousness of that and feel it. And it was funny because when people was looking to, to to have a rational experience and there's another book that I love that is called The Master and His Emissary. I don't know if you have read that book. It's an amazing book about scientific study, about that life is perceived completely different. You can understand who are your best friends or the wars of the world of countries. Collective kind of reactions, depending in the right hemisphere of the brain or the left hemisphere of the brain.

[01:16:40.900] - Speaker 2
And we conceive the world. And depending on which one you are kind of more towards, you construct the life absolutely, absolutely different that the same thing is absolutely different. So I could see the reaction of people that were very left brain.

[01:16:59.500] - Speaker 4
Side.

[01:16:59.900] - Speaker 2
Inside rational trying to say, what the fuck is this? This doesn't make sense. This is stupid, this is pretentious, this is narcissistic. And the other people that, you know, I always invited I. It was funny in the moment that I learned that that I felt okay. I understand there's people that are approaching this very rationally and they are demanding a reason of every thing. They they will be irritated and they will be obviously fighting with the film. So I invite in some of the screenings that I went for people to turn off the rational copilot and just allow themselves to feel and experience and fly. So I said that and.

[01:17:41.970] - Speaker 4
I said it before the.

[01:17:42.810] - Speaker 3
Film started.

[01:17:43.490] - Speaker 2
Yes. And I said, please, just I invite you. Don't think about it. There's nothing to think. There's a lot to feel and a lot to laugh and turn off your copilot. Do not demand reason to a dream because it's a dream. So to. If you demand reason to a dream, that dream will be fucked. So just dream with the dream fly. You can imagine how many people after that screenings thank me because I give them a Q and A clue for them to understand. You know, it was just a little.

[01:18:18.320] - Speaker 4
Guidance.

[01:18:19.760] - Speaker 2
And it was so important. They said, if you should not tell me that, I will probably will be fighting with the first 20 minutes, then there are people, survive it or not. But it was a difficult kind of thing. Yes. And it was amazing that that little warning thing was enough for them to allow themselves to liberate from their rational, mind demanding thing. And then the people love it, and they were floating and they were connecting.

[01:18:43.960] - Speaker 3
Okay, the next question I have based on that is, is there a way to visually. Make that invitation in the In the beginning of the film. I don't mean you out there talking. I don't mean, uh, how would what would we see that would give the audience that understanding without you having to say it?

[01:19:13.190] - Speaker 2
I thought that I had done it, but I'm. I'm now sure that I did not accomplish what I wanted, and it didn't work, uh, because of, of course, many people really struggle with that rationalizing of the film and trying to understand it. But the film, if, if, if the film starts with a shadow, uh, being projected in the desert and, and you see, this shadow is like, if you are standing in the desert with the sun behind you and your long shadow is projected, and these shadows start running, and then the shadow starts flying. So it's a radical point of view from the head and the eyes of somebody that you have not seen actually is you. So it's you become this shadow flying, struggling to go and then landed and then walking and then running and then take off again and then again cannot and is trying to fly try to, to to get out of the gravitational kind of thing and he can and, and finally the shadow is just above.

[01:20:25.530] - Speaker 2
And then suddenly there's a tilt up and then you see the huge horizon, and then there's this long corridor with the sun, and then there's this. So it's very oneiric and very the point of view is radical. You have never seen a film start like that. I think it's one of my favorite opening scene of my films by far. But it's what I'm telling to the audience is let yourself be in the in this character mind, or in your own dreams. And how many times I don't know if you if you dream that you fly, but I. I dream a lot that I fly and I fly that way. Very low to the ground.

[01:20:59.160] - Speaker 3
Yeah, I don't I don't have flying dreams.

[01:21:01.000] - Speaker 2
That's funny because a lot, you know, I have seen like.

[01:21:03.480] - Speaker 4
Yeah, like 50% of the people.

[01:21:05.200] - Speaker 3
Many people do.

[01:21:06.160] - Speaker 2
So I'm inviting the people with this image to let themselves be that person. I mean, it's the shadow projected of whoever wants to take that position and say, okay, go and leave that. But obviously it was not enough.

[01:21:20.040] - Speaker 4
Yeah.

[01:21:21.480] - Speaker 3
It's interesting though, isn't it? It's like we can never know. We can never know what what what someone understands or what they don't, and whether it's important for them to understand it or not. All those things I, I saw that scene because I watched first 20 minutes, as I said, and I thought it was beautiful, but I didn't necessarily understand the metaphor.

[01:21:40.280] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And more than the metaphor, it's just like it's like obviously a kind of a weird kind of state, but it's not necessarily, you know, it's not necessarily.

[01:21:48.800] - Speaker 4
It did feel.

[01:21:49.280] - Speaker 3
Dreamlike. It felt like I didn't understand what was happening. It was, uh, it forced me to pay attention. Because when you don't when you don't know what's happening, you get. I get more alert. Mhm. You know, when something's all laid out before you something I say a lot like I don't feel the need to hold the audience's hand and walk them through, you know, like if they get it, they get it. If they don't that's fine. It doesn't. I don't think it really matters.

[01:22:20.390] - Speaker 4
I think you will.

[01:22:20.910] - Speaker 2
Enjoy it if you know that you know how to navigate that, because the film is.

[01:22:25.310] - Speaker 3
I'll enjoy it anyway. Because I felt like from the first time that I saw Birdman, I had that feeling of in some ways, the invitation in that one is the levitation.

[01:22:36.350] - Speaker 2
Exactly like it's clearly a mind game because he is levitating, Michael Keaton is levitating, and then the camera, if you remember, I started pushing in the camera and then I arrived to his back and you see him full and then? Then the computer sound. He turns and then he stand up, and now he's in his weakness, you know, naked and. And you. The trick was that you never know he was floating or not. Because then when he stand up.

[01:23:07.540] - Speaker 4
Yeah, it's.

[01:23:08.060] - Speaker 2
Clearly that he was just meditating in his fucking, you know, with his ass in the floor, but he thinks that he's floating. So I make you I start the game at that moment to say this is how he feels. But reality is not. But it's not. It's very subtle. So I never.

[01:23:25.500] - Speaker 4
Really.

[01:23:26.300] - Speaker 2
Do it. Very obvious. It's always.

[01:23:28.340] - Speaker 4
Subtle. And I play with you.

[01:23:29.780] - Speaker 3
As much as I love the movie, I didn't know that. And my takeaway was, wow, I wonder what the reality, what reality is like in this movie. That was my.

[01:23:40.860] - Speaker 4
Feeling exactly.

[01:23:41.740] - Speaker 3
Like I actually more went along. I didn't fight it. I went along with it. It's like, oh, this is a movie where he can he has special powers. That's cool.

[01:23:50.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no, I agree with you, but I think that's the important thing because I think it's always very surprising what people taste, what not. Sometimes you fail. I have failed many times to connect or try to make a point, and you don't do it and try to connect in some way. But I think, again, as we were talking, it's not in our hands and everybody has their own. Depending on where you live, your cultural background, what you have breakfast that morning and there's people that in a way are very obsessed to get what they know already and what they expect. I always when I see a film, a new film, I always want to see what film that filmmaker wanted to do. Not the one that I wanted to see. Yeah. You know, I think that's very important that you suddenly say, I want to see what is that film that he wanted to know. And, and, and I try always to Always to celebrate that kind of thing.

[01:24:49.400] - Speaker 2
But then if my mind and I find myself now against the film and that obviously I know that it has to do much more with me than with that guy, because that woman or that whatever, because obviously they want to make that and connect that. Now, if I get it or not, it's not their fault. It's my own limitations.

[01:25:09.240] - Speaker 4
Yeah.

[01:25:09.760] - Speaker 2
Or my.

[01:25:10.160] - Speaker 4
Own habits.

[01:25:11.560] - Speaker 3
And I don't even think it matters because it's like if you read a poem, you might not have the same interpretation that the poet had when they wrote it. You either like it or you don't. And you bring your all of yourself, the the listener. The reader brings all of themselves to it. And and I love that that conversation between the maker and the and the audience where you're in, you're inviting. I feel like you're inviting the audience to participate in this movie. That's that's the feeling I got. I got the feeling like I can. I don't know what you're thinking, but I know this is not regular. The situation is not regular. I'm not sure what it means, but I'm. I'm excited that it's not regular because I'm. I'm I'm excited for an exciting journey. You know, like, this is going to be where is this going to go? Now what's going to happen.

[01:26:08.700] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[01:26:09.660] - Speaker 2
And it's. Yeah. And I think that, you know, I, I try now very, very consciously because of that, because I cannot control the results. I now deliberately try that what I'm writing, what I'm doing, what I'm shooting. I love it. I make sure that I love it because I know that I'm not a martian. I know that if I love it, there's going to be a lot of people like me. Yeah. With my sensitivity, my whatever principles, experience or whatever is that that they will respond to that. Because I always say to the young guys that now with the social media and all that, they are terrifying to be accepted, to be, to be liked. And how many followers and all that which I and you never born with that and the new generations. It's a very terrifying, paralyzing possibility to say you have to be liked, you have.

[01:27:05.050] - Speaker 4
To be you.

[01:27:05.850] - Speaker 3
And they make they make decisions based on that, which is insane.

[01:27:10.730] - Speaker 2
That's and that's what I now radically I said, you know, I would like just to I always said that you cannot write a film thinking in an audience. I cannot find my audience because the audience is an abstract thought. I don't know who what is audience? When we say the masses, it's an abstract thought. The masses, for me, is a different concept than for you. And I don't know these people, but if I like it, the audiences will find the movie.

[01:27:44.040] - Speaker 4
Well, you know.

[01:27:44.760] - Speaker 3
At least one person likes it. And if you're making it with someone else in mind, it's possible nobody likes it.

[01:27:50.800] - Speaker 2
I completely agree with you. And I know that this film and all the films has found the tribe. I said, I have my tribe. I belong to a tribe.

[01:27:59.840] - Speaker 4
Yes.

[01:28:00.200] - Speaker 2
And now? Now you and I are connected. I have the privilege and honor to be with you here. Because I found that you are part of my tribe. I never thought about you, but you.

[01:28:08.600] - Speaker 4
Found the film.

[01:28:09.240] - Speaker 3
1,000,000%. I'm in the tribe, and I'm ecstatic. And I'm so happy. The tribe exists because I don't feel that connected. So many things. So it's really, uh. It means a great deal to me.

[01:28:21.960] - Speaker 4
I have a bad.

[01:28:22.600] - Speaker 2
News for you. We are a tribe in extinction.

[01:28:26.360] - Speaker 4
It's okay, it's okay.

[01:28:28.520] - Speaker 3
It's okay. Do you know what, though? The things that we make are going to inspire someone to make something amazing.

[01:28:35.080] - Speaker 4
Yes, yes. Can't help, can't help it.

[01:28:37.560] - Speaker 2
I agree, and honestly, I couldn't be more happy. I happy. I don't know what happened to you, but maybe the film, the albums that probably has been maybe the less successful commercially are the ones that you feel more proud about it, you know, and this for me, because the tribe get a little bit even more radical and more exquisite.

[01:28:58.070] - Speaker 4
Yeah, no.

[01:28:58.790] - Speaker 3
When someone comes up and talks to me about something I worked on that other people don't come and talk about, it's always like, really? That's the one that spoke to you?

[01:29:06.910] - Speaker 4
Exactly.

[01:29:07.630] - Speaker 3
It's always interesting like that. That's a great feeling.

[01:29:10.390] - Speaker 4
To find.

[01:29:10.950] - Speaker 2
The the tribe like like that is is fantastic. But I have to say another thing to that, you know what I did this time for, you know, I have been doing it, but this time I did it radically and I'm so glad that I did. I did not read any review. Not the good ones, not the bad ones. And let me tell you, it was the most amazing. You know, I was not intoxicated. Exactly.

[01:29:36.510] - Speaker 3
My heart was not the thing you love and you freed it out into the world. and now it's going to go do its work.

[01:29:41.740] - Speaker 4
Suddenly beautiful.

[01:29:42.780] - Speaker 2
Suddenly I felt that if I will be jumping into it, reading the good ones are the bad ones. That doesn't matter if it's good or bad. First of all, it will not change the outcome of the film. Will. The film will not be better or bad or worse? No. And my heart. I will put my heart in the hands of people. And I said no. My heart belongs to me and I cannot be. And in that moment I was so liberated and not intoxicated.

[01:30:10.660] - Speaker 4
It's beautiful.

[01:30:11.300] - Speaker 2
I have to say that without that.

[01:30:13.500] - Speaker 4
Yes, I.

[01:30:14.140] - Speaker 2
Think I will be fucked. You know what I mean? Because it's.

[01:30:16.420] - Speaker 4
What the kids now.

[01:30:17.300] - Speaker 2
With all the critics in the Instagram, which I don't have.

[01:30:20.180] - Speaker 4
It's exactly.

[01:30:21.260] - Speaker 2
I said to the kids, if I will have an Instagram with 1 million followers and I read what you read, I will kill myself. But for me it's unconceivable. Sometimes I cannot understand it even.

[01:30:31.380] - Speaker 4
But, but, but.

[01:30:32.220] - Speaker 2
But I'm wrong. Probably. But it's just for me. Something that is creating a lot of anxiety in people because I will be anxiety about to be judged. Every day when I wake up to see what people think about me. I mean.

[01:30:45.730] - Speaker 4
But you.

[01:30:46.090] - Speaker 3
Always have the opportunity to turn.

[01:30:48.530] - Speaker 4
To turn off.

[01:30:49.930] - Speaker 3
You know, you don't have to decide to be the most popular kid in school. It's okay.

[01:30:55.170] - Speaker 2
I completely agree. The thing is that then sometimes when I have had young people to say I did it, but then I couldn't keep doing it because the way my generation communicates and exists is this. And if not, you do not exist. Yeah. You know, so it's now it's becoming a very radical thing because even access to to everything, to information to your bank accounts, I mean, like suddenly get out of that is.

[01:31:20.650] - Speaker 4
Actually I had a.

[01:31:21.250] - Speaker 3
Conversation with a basketball player, one of the Golden State Warriors, serious basketball player, serious team. And he was saying he's so frustrated that the owners of the team are so insistent that the players spend all their time on social media and that they're always followed by cameras. And he said, it really gets in the way of the game. It's like we're I did this because I love basketball and now all of this other stuff. Even from the people who want us to play basketball, the powers that be in basketball want to commodify the long tail of everything else around it. And he's saying, I can't focus. I can't focus on the game. It's all distraction.

[01:32:10.360] - Speaker 4
Wow.

[01:32:10.760] - Speaker 3
It's interesting.

[01:32:12.040] - Speaker 2
Super interesting. You remember this documentary of Jean-Luc Godard about, uh, the the the the Rolling Stones. Sympathy for the devil. You remember that documentary? One of the things that was very funny for me to find once I, I have the, the the opportunity to meet with Mick Jagger in a party, and I have just seen that this was like ten years ago, and I have just seen the Godard video where where it was amazing for the people that hasn't seen it. You know, it was incredible. Again, the, the, the sensitivity of Godard to record the process of that song being made in the studio, when who would know that that song would become a mythical song like basically one of the most important songs in the rock and roll history? Why he chose that one and not another one anyway. And, and and obviously he's recording the whole process and the song. How different the song start being. Right. I mean, it was a it started immediately. There was no like the.

[01:33:22.980] - Speaker 2
No, it was a start. All full, full instruments. It was much more noisy. It was another song and the camera of Godard and the present of Goddard, who was a rock star at that time, obviously start affecting the whole behavior of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, and they start kind of getting along not very well. And all the comments and they were kind of showing off who was the smartest guy in the room, and funny enough, is clearly how the camera was affecting their behavior, personalities and actually the participation in the authorship and the ideas of the of the of the song, which had funny enough, ended up being very good, by the way. I mean, they start stripping out a lot of things. Yes, which was very interesting, the chemistry about it. And then at the end, the most, the most funny thing for me was when they were now the process has been finished and they will record the song the next day and go, that's it, I'm done.

[01:34:25.610] - Speaker 2
I'm not gonna shoot the the recording of the actually real song.

[01:34:31.250] - Speaker 3
He saw the process.

[01:34:32.170] - Speaker 4
And.

[01:34:32.400] - Speaker 2
Then that's it. And he didn't want to show the process. So I have just seen that documentary, and I went to a party the next day and I suddenly found out Mick Jagger, and I'm a big fan of him. I said, oh, it's a pleasure to meet you. Great honor. And we spent like 30 minutes talking about it. And I told him, you know, I have just seen this documentary. It was amazing for me to see that this guy didn't didn't record, didn't document the recording. And he told me an anecdote that I found it amazing because he said that that when Godard said that all the other members were kind of, we need a camera.

[01:35:10.040] - Speaker 4
Like like what you.

[01:35:11.440] - Speaker 2
Were saying, you know, like suddenly when you are being observed and being judged, it can go either way.

[01:35:18.080] - Speaker 4
You can be you.

[01:35:18.840] - Speaker 2
Can become a great, a better person, conscious of your actions, and suddenly you become aware in a good, positive way. Or you can become a fucking, you know, selfish, Self-conscious, pretentious or whatever. It can go either way. So suddenly they felt that they need that. It was almost like, wait a minute, where is the where is my social media? Where is the. And it becomes a kind of a crisis. And so some of them wanted some of them not. They started kind of fighting. Uh, and then the producer of, of the, of the, of the documentary was said to Jean-Luc. Jean-Luc? What do you mean that you will not come tomorrow? Tomorrow is the ending of the whole thing. We have been here for two weeks or whatever. No, I just want the process. Wait a minute. And they start fighting. And he. Mick Jagger told me that suddenly he said, are you fucking crazy? I'm paying this fucking thing.

[01:36:14.550] - Speaker 2
You will document the whole thing. No, I don't want to. I know what I know. And they start fighting fist fighting in the in the studio and they were rolling bloody nose. And that hitting the producer. The producer said, sir, you are an asshole. I will cancel that. And the Rolling Stones, just seeing these two guys fighting and Godard defending his concept that he knew very well that that was it. That's it. That's enough. And the other guy thinking in the money saying, no, you have to fucking have the result. And he didn't. They fight. They blood and everything. And that's the end of the story, which I found was fascinating.

[01:36:54.460] - Speaker 4
Absolutely.

[01:36:54.940] - Speaker 2
Especially the thing that I didn't know that some of the guys wanted the fucking camera to keep with that kind of stamina and adrenaline, and then fucking Godard pushing the limits of his principles, which was the principle, is the process, not the end result. I don't care about the end result, which is fascinating.

[01:37:12.420] - Speaker 4
Absolutely right.

[01:37:13.460] - Speaker 2
I feel sometimes when I have done, I always laugh when I go to a TV show or something. One one of those programs that are like a TV. I always laugh that the the host and sometimes they are really nice people and very normal and they arrive and say, how are you, Alejandro? I love this, and how are you doing? And how is your wife or whatever kind of personal thing? And they're very kind of nice and quiet. Normal. And it's only okay. Cameras rolling. And then when the cameras are. Hello, friends. We are here. This is Friday morning, and we have Alejandro Gonzalez, and suddenly he become another person, loud and completely artificial. And then he brought me to this thing that I have to suddenly start dealing with somebody that I was so nicely. But that that happened in a second. It's a transformation with the camera rolling. Action. Good.

[01:38:07.450] - Speaker 4
Goodbye.

[01:38:08.330] - Speaker 3
I think that's something, though, that professional actors can overcome. I mean, again, seeing Thomas Hardy and seeing Leo in Revenant, it doesn't look like they're concerned about the cameras.

[01:38:20.170] - Speaker 2
No, no, it's it's something that I don't know how the actors do it or the actresses, you know, like people like Cate Blanchett or Sean Penn. I remember in 21g that you mentioned he was doing a guy that is dying from lung cancer and, you know, and he's, you know, barely walking with fucking oxygen in the thing. And he, you know, you put the camera. I remember that Rodrigo Prieto, my DP, and I the first scene, that was my first American movie, the first scene that I shot was Sean walking in his apartment, you know, struggling with some little kind of thing with his oxygen and barely can walk and breathing with a little and. Okay, camera roll. And I was so excited to see in the screen to Sean, I said, I'm shooting fucking Sean Penn. And he was okay. Action. And he was just walking and doing it perfect. I mean, it was wow. Like like fucking.

[01:39:11.910] - Speaker 4
Wow.

[01:39:12.350] - Speaker 2
Like if you said to, uh, Miles Davis, you know, okay, rolling and Miles, I mean, it was like just to hear one of those. You say it cannot be better.

[01:39:20.750] - Speaker 3
How incredible is.

[01:39:21.550] - Speaker 2
That? So it's that sensation. Oh, my God, I.

[01:39:24.310] - Speaker 7
Look at that and.

[01:39:25.620] - Speaker 2
Suddenly. Okay, cut. And so and I'm telling you, that scene or one that he was just crying or shouting, whatever, and then cut. And in some moment the guy just, you know, straight up starts smiling, making a joke, having a fucking smoke, telling me some anecdote of her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, okay. Ready? Ready. Okay. Rolling. Take an action and suddenly look. That fruit full of life and, you know, soul and soulful and light the eyes and suddenly the eyes were death.

[01:39:59.660] - Speaker 4
Wow.

[01:40:01.340] - Speaker 2
I mean, it was like a magic.

[01:40:03.100] - Speaker 4
I mean, it's unbelievable. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable.

[01:40:05.660] - Speaker 2
I couldn't I cannot understand how they can do that.

[01:40:09.420] - Speaker 4
I love that you fought for it. That's great. You had to. No, no.

[01:40:12.060] - Speaker 3
Because you understood.

[01:40:13.500] - Speaker 2
I mean, I mean, uh, you know, it's always the notes normally, and I agree, I would use I mean, when somebody gave me a good note, a good idea. I'm thirsty.

[01:40:23.020] - Speaker 4
