[00:00:06.670] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammatism. Where does art come from? Where does anything come from? Why do I have a thought after I had after the next thought, after the next thought? Why does it move in one direction? Why do you want to make another thing and another thing? Where does that come from that comes to you? Some of it becomes more mysterious and other things become to take on a form that I understand better. I think I think recently a lot about vectors. First of all, I was working with this kid and we use a lot of vectors in to design stuff. If you have a vector, it never makes an abrupt move. If you pull it here, it goes there. There is something to a vector. It's like a wave. I even feel that at the moment, breathing or whatever or tension in the body, you feel this and you're like, how there is a... What I like about the vector at the moment is there is a linear direction of movement to this. That I often think when you make stuff that it is not on a line, but more on a moving thing.

[00:01:45.900] - Speaker 1
It's like rolling through?

[00:01:48.180] - Speaker 2
I think it's more on a wave or it's on something, but it's the same in your mind. What makes your mind want to have the next thought after you just... It keeps going.

[00:02:03.810] - Speaker 1
Or even the first thought, where does it come from? I know in my case, sometimes there'll be a trigger. It'll be in reaction to something, but I don't know what the nature of that reaction is. I'll hear something, an ideal pop into my head in reaction to something, but they might not be related at all. I don't see the connection. But I know without that trigger, I wouldn't have had the thought.

[00:02:33.240] - Speaker 2
Oh, absolutely. With some of the making, like what's interesting about what keeps more interesting to me is that you never know because there are things when you express yourself with your hands that are not clear where they come from. They just come out of a knowledge of a hand. I'm sure it's the same with instruments. It's just a other part of your body you can use and how all these parts of your body can play together. And then I get obsessed. Once I'm on something, I'm like, I've become driven to the point where when I go to bed, I dream about this stuff. Then I know I need to slow down.

[00:03:22.830] - Speaker 1
Do you think of yourself as a researcher in that way?

[00:03:26.660] - Speaker 2
I always absorb any information I find.

[00:03:30.520] - Speaker 1
Do you research things online? How do you do your-?

[00:03:33.600] - Speaker 2
Anything. I buy a lot of books. Almost every day or every couple of days, I buy books.

[00:03:39.900] - Speaker 1
What would be the range of subjects?

[00:03:42.330] - Speaker 2
Books, primarily art books with pictures in them. I never read text. I just look at the images. I'm like, Image, image, image, image.

[00:03:52.260] - Speaker 1
What about engineering books or mechanical things?

[00:03:55.380] - Speaker 2
I buy books about plants. For example, I bought the book about pines. That was interesting because there was actually a pine cone. You have these pines here, two different ones. But there is one here that only opens in a fire.

[00:04:09.850] - Speaker 1
I didn't know that.

[00:04:10.490] - Speaker 2
So the sap closes the pine cone so nobody can steal the seeds. And they pop open in a fire. And then afterwards, the brush is cleared and they have fertile grounds. And that's how they think it's their biggest way of success is starting there. Things like that.

[00:04:32.530] - Speaker 1
I was researching pine cones this week also.

[00:04:35.560] - Speaker 2
I can say that they spoke about pine. It's really good. It's actually once you get hooked on those, it's about every plant. There is one I have about roses. One of my favorite thing is grass. I love grass because grass is like leaves. They all look different. They're all the same, but they all have that little individual something. They express themselves in different ways.

[00:05:06.860] - Speaker 1
When you look close, there's a lot going on in grass.

[00:05:12.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:05:13.540] - Speaker 1
There's a lot of life happening.

[00:05:17.370] - Speaker 2
And it's beautiful. Yeah. It's smart. Palms are grass.

[00:05:21.310] - Speaker 1
I didn't know that.

[00:05:23.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah, they're grass. So that's why they grow. So the coconuts must, in this case, be seeds, not nuts. And coconuts, for example, that's the research. So coconut, in a way, I have to coconut the beaches because the coconut is a self-contained thing. It has all its nutrients and everything. It floats on the ocean and then gets washed up and it can sprout while it floats in the ocean for three, four months. And it can sprout there and start to grow. It's like its own little island that then gets washed ashore in a storm weather, and it gets why you have coconut trees on the beach. That's fascinating. It's totally Once you start looking at that stuff, you're like, wow.

[00:06:02.840] - Speaker 1
I think recognizing those patterns are really helpful if you're making things. Just knowing how some things work is helpful.

[00:06:15.730] - Speaker 2
A nature works. I'm just in awe, lifelong, forever awe.

[00:06:24.840] - Speaker 1
Is all art essentially a conversation with what came before?

[00:06:30.010] - Speaker 2
I think it's a conversation with what's before, and it's a passing on. The way I always understood it is you get something. Basically, when I was a teenager, I realized at some point you can jump in to art. So there was somewhere with a good library and I went there and you can say you can just hop on that train. And then it starts expanding very fast. Any new field you get in at that age, but you're like, Oh, well, you just see the whole line and you're part of anything that was ever made. You can become part of that. And in that, I believe that it's basically you just pass on. And by passing it on, you pass it through you. So it's more about passing on than about the past, in a way. Because nothing leaves if it's not remembered.

[00:07:27.230] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And the idea that it's going by whether you participate or not. You choose to get involved, but if you don't, it's going.

[00:07:37.910] - Speaker 2
It's going anyway. You know it's going. Was there a library that first caught your attention? I think the first library caught my attention is my grandparents had them, art books from a series, maybe a subscription. You get one a month for like Caravacho, the Dildo. Because they were not the good books, they were low. You know? They were on the bottom shelf.

[00:08:02.950] - Speaker 1
You could reach them.

[00:08:04.330] - Speaker 2
You could reach them and you look at all these pictures and you don't know anything makes any sense. Mainly in there, there was always this Broglie and Hieronymus Bosch, these two These two images, when you look at them as a kid, they go a little deep.

[00:08:19.610] - Speaker 1
Do you remember looking at the images and not knowing what they meant or not understanding them? What was the feeling inside?

[00:08:26.230] - Speaker 2
I know there was one painting that had... Actually, my grandparents, they had a print reproduction of one painting of a thing, a Broglie painting. And they had... There were people that were sitting in some tavern, a restaurant on some benches, and they were wearing hats. And then they had dishes, plates, and there was one plate was with something red on it and some were with something white on it. I was always thinking of... You don't know what it is, the food, but you don't even think how it tastes. It's just there's something in the... There is this red and this white plate. Maybe it was a formal thing or maybe it meant something, but you just got fascinated or hung up with weird...

[00:09:12.190] - Speaker 1
It's just the details that... You didn't know why it was. Why weren't they all the same.

[00:09:16.430] - Speaker 2
Yeah. No, or why they were two. I mean, the way it's similar to how the brain goes to places. You don't know why for a month you think about a particular place 30 years back, a particular time, and there is no real connector. It's not, Oh, you had a revelation or saw something interesting. If you just we're waiting somewhere or like, you know? And how you go to that other place in your brain. Yeah. And it's like, What are you?

[00:09:52.940] - Speaker 1
Yeah, what's happening? Yeah. Yeah. So much of it is both out of our control, but even out of our understanding. It's dreamlike.

[00:10:01.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I don't even know about understanding anymore.

[00:10:06.900] - Speaker 1
Do you try to understand or no?

[00:10:09.580] - Speaker 2
Sure. I mean, we try to make sense, but it's also like you Actually, continues the conversation I have with this boxing coach. He was saying, When you stop fighting life, your life is good. Which I thought is a very interesting thing coming from an old boxer. Yeah.

[00:10:30.810] - Speaker 1
Tell me, in your view, the evolution of art over time.

[00:10:35.610] - Speaker 2
I'm not sure there is one. I don't think art got better, if that makes sense. I couldn't really say there is something like... I was just trying to think, like an analogy to music and when I thought of music from the medieval times, I used to have a Hildeguard from being in a CV. Incredible. You can listen to this. It's beautiful, but you don't really know how to integrate that so much in your daily life and things that music allows a lot of stuff in a way to celebrate life. I'm not sure art, really, like visual art, if you frame it that narrowly, added that much more to it. I mean, maybe it did. I like old stuff.

[00:11:20.280] - Speaker 1
Me too.

[00:11:22.330] - Speaker 2
I like new stuff too, but it's... If you think of your work in images, and one analogy, the way I always look at it is, if you drive, whatever comes at you is new. That's the new. And new is always about new. It's instantaneous, and you try to understand or sort it. Then there is the blind spot, the thing that's not new. It's not a threat. You don't need to sort it out. It becomes uninteresting, and you stop seeing it. Then there is the rear view mirror. In the rear view mirror, things Things get compacted and they become an image. And once you have the image, it's like you're free to just look at it because it's not coming at you. So then you can just be in this image. For example, here when we look at this, John Chamberlain, the guy is not alive anymore.

[00:12:19.630] - Speaker 1
In the analogy of driving and what's coming towards you, are you saying that the things that you notice are the things that are new? In other words, if you drove the same route every day, Yeah. A lot of what you see would become background wallpaper and you wouldn't notice it anymore. But if there's something that's not there every day, that's the new thing.

[00:12:41.230] - Speaker 2
That's the new thing or it's a threat. New is also fear. You got to make sure you survive. So let's say I was just on the freeway, and I didn't see that big sheet of metal getting under our car. But it's like then it's there very quickly. But if you see that, then that maybe doesn't happen. Like, you always, you know. Yeah.

[00:13:01.740] - Speaker 1
Would you say that you've noticed things in everyday life and they work their way into your work or not necessarily?

[00:13:09.310] - Speaker 2
Everything. I'm an omnivore. I'm not. I I don't have a practice. My practice is just doing things.

[00:13:18.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, just making things or doing things?

[00:13:20.970] - Speaker 2
Both. Making things, thinking about things, doing things. I just love it. It calms me down somehow. It gives me something to do or I don't have a big plan.

[00:13:35.980] - Speaker 1
How would you say sculpture works different than other forms, if it does?

[00:13:43.710] - Speaker 2
I don't know. All I learned is you compete with reality or you're partaking reality in a way of a spatial. And an image has, usually, I think why images have frames or borders are because it's like you enter it and it's not a real thing. It's like an image. Then in the image, everything is possible. But when you make a sculpture, you're bound by the physical world. If there's one approach to understand it, I don't know. It just needs to communicate with the physical world in a different way than an image does. An image is also scalable more like, let's say, you can look at an image in a photograph. Image is more in the mind. I haven't not figured it out, but I do like that challenge.

[00:14:39.710] - Speaker 1
With sculpture, do you always make it knowing where it's going to be or no?

[00:14:45.510] - Speaker 2
No. I try to always make it that it can be anywhere where it wants to be, that it's independent. Everything is synergy, and often unbeknownst to us, the extent of what synergy does, what you find, what you give yourself permission to engage in or something. Let's say the simplest way to explain it. When I work with somebody, their psyche limits what I do. And their psyche expands what I do or my understanding of their psyche. I don't know exactly how to quantify that, but with certain people, you take certain risks. With certain people in maybe there is a moment in your life and the moment in their life where things make sense. Like, I think the best way I ever experienced that was I made a show with Kevin Brown. I don't know who he is. So I was in the phase I wanted to make a show where I show less than there was there before. Yes. And I started to remove in my mind a little bit of the space. And then I just thought, I take the slab out of the floor. And then I thought, why stop there? Let's just keep digging in my mind.

[00:16:09.070] - Speaker 2
I felt like we just take as much as we can out. And at the same time, Gavin was open, but he's also three months earlier, his mother passed. I think we were both for two different reasons in an emotional state where that made sense. I would not think about doing a show like this with All the people I work with, just because it's not there. And that's more something in hindsight, I'm realized, Oh, this or this person is careful and very business-oriented. So you meet your act up somehow. It's like you don't realize how it is. Now I pay more attention, like out of the gate if it doesn't feel right. Or you can use that as an interesting adventure to work with somebody. As long as you have your boundaries in the right place, that's okay.

[00:17:06.290] - Speaker 1
Tell me more about the digging. That's a really interesting idea. It starts with an idea, and do you necessarily know what's going to happen?

[00:17:13.900] - Speaker 2
It's not an idea. It was more a feeling. The feeling is I made so many shows. I didn't want to show something. Also at the time, it felt so like the whole art thing. That was a year before the 2008 crash, but it felt so heated up. The The feeling was more you want to do the opposite.

[00:17:32.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You said take away.

[00:17:34.770] - Speaker 2
Take away, show nothing. But can you show nothing and show something or show less.

[00:17:42.020] - Speaker 1
Do you think you were digging up or looking for what was underneath? Digging could mean a lot of things.

[00:17:52.340] - Speaker 2
Yeah. For me, what it was, it was more about something for a lack of better words about something soul and something that's in deeper. It's not like something-Going inside. Going inside, like digging deeper in a good or the bad way, not needing to qualify that, but just wanting to know more or needing more or whatever it is, just like going in.

[00:18:21.970] - Speaker 1
Just in a practical way, you couldn't do it on the third floor of a museum? No. It only works on the ground floor.

[00:18:28.580] - Speaker 2
It works on the ground floor, yeah. Without a basement.

[00:18:32.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah, without a basement. Yeah. Was it dirt underneath?

[00:18:36.470] - Speaker 2
It was just dirt. I think that part of the West Village is landfill or Greenwich Village. I don't know what it exactly is.

[00:18:41.880] - Speaker 1
Where did it happen?

[00:18:42.880] - Speaker 2
Part of West Village was Greenwich and Leroy, somewhere there in Manhattan.

[00:18:47.780] - Speaker 1
Then there's this fantasy, like buildings totally disappear, like a gallery will not be there anymore.

[00:18:55.330] - Speaker 2
A few years later, I walked by that same gallery where I made the show. They tore it down to build It's too bad.

[00:19:01.940] - Speaker 1
You could have put your name on it. If you only knew.

[00:19:05.680] - Speaker 2
Exactly. They do it for you.

[00:19:09.500] - Speaker 1
It's amazing. Does it ever happen that way where conditions come together seemingly on their own?

[00:19:19.060] - Speaker 2
Yes. If it works out, I mean, who knows? But if it feels right, it feels right. Then you don't... They all think up somehow. Yeah.

[00:19:30.530] - Speaker 1
Do you have a name for the paintings with the fruit or vegetables over the faces?

[00:19:37.020] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the problem paintings is what I call them.

[00:19:40.500] - Speaker 1
Problem paintings.

[00:19:41.660] - Speaker 2
I don't really know. I mean, I was not so I'm not so much aware of that when I started with it. I mean, it has a few different origins in some ways.

[00:19:51.230] - Speaker 1
What was the very first one?

[00:19:53.100] - Speaker 2
The very first one was there were some Frankenstein monsters, and I just I love this image of this Frankenstein.

[00:20:03.090] - Speaker 1
The whole body or the portrait?

[00:20:04.520] - Speaker 2
It was a portrait. It was some of them, torso. I just always liked that character. Somehow, so it started with that. But the images I collected is I had... There was this teenage boy, it was the cousin or the nephew of my girlfriend at the time. I got him some one of these I made a figurine. It was a hand with an eye in it or something like that. I made a package for him, like a gift wrapping. I wanted to make a cooler and I printed out these monsters because of the monster to make as a gift wrapping paper. Then I started working with these images. I didn't know what to do with them until I put some metal things on them first. But there is a lot of origins for me. I once had a friend or somebody, I didn't keep in contact, and he took some drugs. I think he was psychotic. When he left the house, one day started to have a tiny little colored dot, smack in the middle, wherever he looked. And over a month, that dot expanded to a size where he couldn't function anymore because he couldn't see a door handle or a car.

[00:21:25.570] - Speaker 2
In the beginning-So what started as a dot of color expanded to take over his field of vision.

[00:21:31.250] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:21:31.560] - Speaker 2
So slowly every day it expanded more so till he couldn't function anymore. And then, I don't know, I think he went to some place to get help. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in a way, that's something I always I thought this obstruction of... Any form of obstruction between you and this. Then later on, I realized, Oh, I saw that all my life. There is these Magritte paintings that work like this. I'm like, Oh, that's probably plays a huge part in it. But at that I was already having my own fun with it. I'm okay with... I think it's something else if you look at something and you copy it, or you just land in the same place or subconscious Obviously, maybe you're influenced. I think that's all fair game for sure. Then I just thought in some way, I grew up in the '70s as a kid, and there were still a lot of black and white movies on the TV, and there were still these older movie stars, and they were interesting to me, not because they were interesting, they were just interesting because they were perfect. They were these self-contained things. You know what I mean?

[00:22:46.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You think because you only sold them in black and white?

[00:22:48.930] - Speaker 2
Maybe that's a big thing. I think there's a lot of reasons. The only black and white, I think it's from a different time or before counterculture in this way. I mean, you You see how people look in photographs. They're just perfected. I think it's the way the whole... A lot of things worked at that time. It's like this maybe smoothing over some cracks in the whole thing. But in some way, the way they were photographed, they look empty, but they look like so much. But it's not them. It's never them. It's just this thing. And then that has some form of expression or a beauty, almost like a Greek statue in a way. I mean, there is a link if you look at horse-pea-horse photography or this idealization or this light and whatever. It's like this. It's just these things where they don't get in the way. So I realized when you use images like that, they don't interfere because it's not a person who is like... Like they don't need anything. They're made to not need. Yes. They're for you to project on. I always like still life. I like to look at stuff up close.

[00:24:06.980] - Speaker 2
And then I realized, for example, that a fruit is much more timeless than these people. You know what I mean? Yeah. I asked my 16-year-old daughter about four years ago when she was 12. She and her friends were there. So somehow, does anybody know who Marilyn Monroe is? One said, yes, I heard about her. And then, the Elvis, the same girl said, yes, the other one, no clue. You know, this is the idea of iconography and how in popular culture-Short-lived. Very short-lived. Now, with all the YouTube, how these references are just out the window.

[00:24:50.340] - Speaker 1
If the first one was Frankenstein, what ended up on top of Frankenstein?

[00:24:54.330] - Speaker 2
Metal. One was some galvanized pipe, like a plumbing pipe. Then the other one was a bend spoon. Maybe it was inspired by a kid, Uri Geller. Exactly. Like a bend spoon. Then one was another piece of metal conduit-y thing.

[00:25:20.890] - Speaker 1
Did it turn into a format? Are they in a series where the size is similar?

[00:25:25.540] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it became like that. Then I still sometimes get back into it, then I have found wing like two, three, and then I'm…

[00:25:36.490] - Speaker 1
Do you have other series like that? I've seen the metal boxes.

[00:25:41.610] - Speaker 2
They were all done at the same time, the metal boxes. That's different. That was…

[00:25:45.810] - Speaker 1
That's one period of time.

[00:25:46.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no, I don't really have. There's some paintings I make on the iPad, things that come out of… Just out of living with certain devices or your toys, whatever you have. Then there are some other things where it's more serial. I think you don't even have to worry about it because you're so limited as a human being, you will always, in the end, make exactly what you do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:26:18.470] - Speaker 1
Would you say a lot of decision goes into what you make, or is it more it just happens?

[00:26:27.600] - Speaker 2
I try to be somewhat disciplined, but within each thing. I believe in that, not in a shinta way, but the thing has somewhat its own life and logic and wants to go where it goes. And you can guide, you can follow, and you can make it grow, but you cannot force. Then when I realize there are two things that play, then I try to shave one of them out. Often, you come from it to something, and then there's actually two, three things that are there, and you just try to somewhat...

[00:27:04.270] - Speaker 1
Say, focus it.

[00:27:05.370] - Speaker 2
Focus it. Let it be one thing, not three things at once. Then that sometimes leads to something boring, and sometimes it's more exciting. But it's like you let it do its own thing. It's some form of editing, but I think it's a pre-editing. It's not that you edit at the end, you edit as you go or before or long.

[00:27:29.510] - Speaker 1
Typically, when you have an idea for an edit and you do the edit, are you ever surprised by what happens?

[00:27:39.330] - Speaker 2
Sometimes. Sometimes in a positive way and sometimes more with the sculpture stuff, it's in a pretty, not disappointment, but sobering. Like from your high when you think this is great, then you have the thing and it's like, okay. Yeah, It doesn't look right.

[00:28:01.890] - Speaker 1
Does that just mean time to keep working on it or does it mean discard it and make a new thing?

[00:28:06.990] - Speaker 2
Usually, I put it aside.

[00:28:08.960] - Speaker 1
Do you put things aside and come back around to them later, see into them a new later on? Yeah. Yeah.

[00:28:15.950] - Speaker 2
Well, sometimes you're also just not at peace with... I don't know what it is. Sometimes you're not a piece with anything you do. For me, then I don't like it. I mean, it's the same when I make a book or a show or whatever. I'm really excited most of the way through with some dips. And when it's all coming together, I usually cannot walk into that show again. I have a really complicated relationship with that. And then in hindsight, the more time passes back to this rear-view mirror thing, it's like the more I can also embrace that. And actually sometimes even think, That's cool. Wow. But it takes me a It took a very long time to find some connection.

[00:29:04.750] - Speaker 1
When you're making it, you're probably too close to it. But with time, you can see it like a spectator.

[00:29:13.610] - Speaker 2
More so.

[00:29:14.220] - Speaker 1
Do you ever see something new, like years later in a piece that you didn't realize why you liked something, and then years later, you come to like, Now I understand it.

[00:29:26.630] - Speaker 2
Oh, a lot, yeah. That's And some of it is also like, Who was the guy that made this? That's the other encounter I have.

[00:29:36.980] - Speaker 1
It could feel totally foreign.

[00:29:38.670] - Speaker 2
It feels foreign or you have a... I know where I was at somewhat, but you're not really there anymore, and you don't really know, or you see it maybe a little more forgiving with that guy that once was. And so you can see that that guy tried to do this, and then that lets you look up the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Somehow.

[00:30:00.980] - Speaker 1
Every other way where it's like, Wow, that guy was great. I wish I could do what he does.

[00:30:06.620] - Speaker 2
Oh, there's a lot of stuff I could never do again that I wish I... I don't know. Not in a way of lose any sleep over it, but it's more like... There's sometimes an innocence or a coolness or a freshness or a lightness, not even light, just way down or...

[00:30:31.420] - Speaker 1
Now you know a lot more than you did then. That can either be helpful or it could completely undermine that.

[00:30:37.880] - Speaker 2
That can do everything. Well, I'll take that over the other thing at any second. I don't think there was ever a day in my life where I wanted to go a day back. It's weird how that just happens. I think most people feel somewhat this way and you just... How you would never want to trade back. I'm not sure, the body and stuff like that's not so fun. But even that.

[00:31:08.720] - Speaker 1
Would you say all the work in some way is biographical?

[00:31:14.840] - Speaker 2
I think it's inevitable, personally. That's my opinion. There's a lot of different thoughts from different people. But I think biographical energy plays into anything you do. It's maybe self Synergy or whatever. But you know, it's like there is not just you doing the thing. There is you doing the thing. I do a practice where you just do whatever comes your way. Then I have friends that have this practice where they do this thing. They do this thing for decades. If I envision myself like you do this thing, you go in there for 10 hours a day and you do this thing. What is that thing? But maybe within that, there is a lot of room. For also biographical little things. It's just maybe it's not as loud, it's maybe not as screaming, it's not like as raw. Maybe it's, I don't know what it is, but it's fascinating to me. That's also, I think you see that more with people that have an image, so to speak. You know what they do. The stance, it's like there is a clear representation of... One thing when you think about art One thing I'm fascinated about it is I like Everest.

[00:32:50.190] - Speaker 2
I don't like individual artworks much. It's fine. But I like what somebody did in their entire life. That's interesting. The body of work. The whole body of work with their bad ears, the good ears, the interesting. The whole package, I think, is where the real power lays for me in art. It's a a package I find not so clearly in other arts.

[00:33:21.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:33:22.550] - Speaker 2
And in that there is this thing where, there is always this idea of authenticity. Somebody can be very greedy and corrupt and just makes things for money. But that's authentic. You have a very authentic person trying to make a little step into a commercial thing and they lose everything they have. And it's just because it's not authentic to them. And you see that in a... This is just one fragment. You see, if you look at somebody's entire life of everything they do. And when it comes to an You see, one of my best or closest experience I have with art, where it's really positive because I'm not always liking it, is I go into a beautiful retrospective show somewhere and I walk out and I see things differently.

[00:34:21.560] - Speaker 1
You see the world differently after experiencing that?

[00:34:25.390] - Speaker 2
Yes. It adds something to how I see or how you you pay attention to or just how you experience things.

[00:34:36.350] - Speaker 1
It'd be like reading someone's biography. The equivalent to that would be going to their show, seeing their life's work, and you're getting a sense of how they see the world. Yeah.

[00:34:48.030] - Speaker 2
It's in a more visual, nonverbal way. That's something I'm always drawn, logically. I just like shapes and colors. For whatever reason, we have different preferences as people. It's just somebody saw it for you and then helps you see it in a way.

[00:35:10.600] - Speaker 1
You see a new possibility, maybe.

[00:35:13.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Or it's just understand them. That's more of an image, if that makes sense. Yes. I often think if you're more all over the place, what do you your image here? Yeah.

[00:35:31.080] - Speaker 1
You remember the first time you had the experience of seeing a retrospective of an artist and feeling changed by it?

[00:35:37.900] - Speaker 2
Yeah, totally.

[00:35:38.830] - Speaker 1
What was the first one?

[00:35:39.950] - Speaker 2
As a semi-grown up, about 17 or 18, I saw Bruce Naaman show, and I didn't know who that is. I walked in there and there were these clowns screaming and some shit moving. And you're like, I've really felt that. I was like, What the fuck is this? You see things in a way You've never experienced them before.

[00:36:02.150] - Speaker 1
Do you say you had no context for it?

[00:36:04.660] - Speaker 2
Zero. Very little. It just walked in and you're like... Yeah.

[00:36:08.790] - Speaker 1
With this, no context, it could go either way. It could be the coolest thing you've ever seen, or the first instinct could be, I don't know what this is. I don't like it.

[00:36:19.410] - Speaker 2
Well, that's two feelings. I mean, a lot of things you don't like, they're the same as the things you like.

[00:36:29.620] - Speaker 1
They some charge that you're reacting to. When you were describing the energy before, there's a piece in the room and there's energy. Is the energy in the piece or is the energy in you reacting to the piece?

[00:36:48.020] - Speaker 2
There is a... I remember, but I was a little older. I was maybe 18 or 19. I was in the National Gallery in London. There is this first room. You come in with all these impressionist paintings. One goes the sunflowers, the Serra, this paper from whatever. You can stand there and you watch everybody. Most people that came in had a reaction to a recording of some pigment and binder on canvas that has been placed in a specific place. And, logically, it's just molecules and whatever. But everybody had a reaction. So that would make it a perpetuum mobile, of sorts. Because everybody can take energy out and only once energy has been put in. Yeah. It doesn't stop giving the energy. I think that's probably something that has to do with the ability. I mean, you're way more knowledgeable, but anything you can record has that chance of being encountered. It again and again and again. In what is it? It's in the recording. In this case, when it's molecules, I have no idea. I do know that some things feel good, for example, when it's not just a visual experience. Some things feel good, some things look good, some things smell good.

[00:38:20.890] - Speaker 2
That's definitely stuff that is in there or tastes good.

[00:38:26.000] - Speaker 1
You think it all relates back to nature?

[00:38:29.970] - Speaker 2
I don't know.

[00:38:31.250] - Speaker 1
Is nature our blueprint for what looks good and tastes good or not necessarily?

[00:38:37.090] - Speaker 2
I mean, like beauty?

[00:38:39.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:38:40.860] - Speaker 2
I'm fascinated with nature. I have so many different plants. I'm like, I get new plants every week. My garden is full of plants. I'm fascinated because it grows out of very little. Like even airplanes, I have airplanes. So it grows out of nothing. Little light, I don't know, little water. And they leave more behind than they take. They sort it out with each other. They always figure it out who grows, what. But it seems... And then some of them have blossoms. And when you have the flowers, then you attract insects and you attract birds. Some little hummingbird, whatever. And then the flowers communicate. And the blossom is like, I don't know the history of the blossom. I've once reading up about it, like magnolias. So it became a way of means of transport or procreation in a way. Flowers, even in nature, they stand out. I mean, to us and to any insect. You can just watch. They go, they all know and how they smell. When you watch an animal, usually they walk. They're their gaze, so graceful. Their coats. I mean, it's just divine, you know? Yeah. And they don't make mistakes, really, or something.

[00:40:11.840] - Speaker 2
They're not confused. It just see them doing their thing. It's hard to imagine that beauty is not the part of all of it or that it's just our perception. So in my feeling, it is... Let's say you look at an iPhone, that's the best we can do. It's really amazing what they managed to put in there. In so many ways. But you look at... I like to look at leaves a lot. You know? Yeah. Just how that all works and it makes it all out of nothing and then it disappears and how everything works together and then from whatever, microbes and all the crazy stuff we don't even understand. But how smart that design is and then how clumsy everything else feels. Our achievements, a toilet bowl or whatever. It has the right water flow to flush. It's like, I made this.

[00:41:22.520] - Speaker 1
It's totally barbaric in comparison.

[00:41:25.450] - Speaker 2
Exactly. To every little bug. I mean, I watch ants.

[00:41:30.150] - Speaker 1
Miraculous.

[00:41:31.190] - Speaker 2
I mean, the ants. Then I see the ants carrying some stuff.

[00:41:34.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah, big stuff. Little ants carrying big things.

[00:41:38.170] - Speaker 2
Then you see them communicating, like how they go around. Then you see people trying to communicate.

[00:41:50.360] - Speaker 1
It's difficult.

[00:41:52.340] - Speaker 2
It's very difficult.

[00:41:53.410] - Speaker 1
I don't think words do justice to the experience.

[00:41:58.380] - Speaker 2
No. As a human, When you're a human, you're born early. It's plain. I think because from somebody told me, my sister told me, studied biology and zoology and whatever. Because we walk up right, we come out a little early for the size of mammal we are. But we can afford that to rear our children slowly. Then if you think it takes 18 years to be able to go out into the world. Until you learn all these complicated social norms and all that. I was recently at the dentist and I had this video playing of this octopus. It's just one of these underwater films. It's just like this thing was so freaking smart and beautiful and how it moved. I was thinking about me raising my two daughters and how come they can get some attitude from a teenager. You're like, what good does that do, actually? You know what I'm saying? Yeah. There's a level of complication to everything and our interactions. What is it?

[00:43:13.590] - Speaker 1
It starts with us deciding we know the right way to do it, which is a real question mark. Who knows?

[00:43:22.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, that's just a feeling. When you think you're right, that's usually a feeling, no? Yeah.

[00:43:29.310] - Speaker 1
Who knows? And what's right for you and what's right for me might not be the same. And what's right for us might not be right for someone on the other side of the world. It's impossible to know. There's too many conditions that dictate everything.

[00:43:43.410] - Speaker 2
Or what you think is right for you is actually wrong for you. Yeah. Like, oh, I'm like this. Yeah. Yeah. Not even that long ago.

[00:44:01.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, less.

[00:44:03.910] - Speaker 2
I always remember that my parents said it was difficult to rent an apartment because they were not married. Yeah. Like, and then you're thinking, what the fuck? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you care?

[00:44:13.350] - Speaker 1
In other parts of the world, the rules could be completely different. How many places have you lived in the world?

[00:44:19.970] - Speaker 2
Just Europe and here. Europe, the differences are there, but it's not like...

[00:44:27.340] - Speaker 1
Closer than everywhere else.

[00:44:29.280] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think I never lived in Latin countries in Europe. It's like that's a different culture, I think. I grew up in Switzerland and I lived in England, which was more different than at some point I ended up in Berlin a bit. Then I lived in Amsterdam. When I was 19, I moved there. The first place I moved to because I thought it's smaller, I can manage.

[00:44:53.040] - Speaker 1
Amsterdam was the first place you moved.

[00:44:54.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and I didn't speak any English. My English was from liner notes for a dictionary. It was not...

[00:45:03.240] - Speaker 1
Was Amsterdam a good experience?

[00:45:05.090] - Speaker 2
I had a really good time. It was a sweet size of a city when you're alone and you go out and you don't really know what you want.

[00:45:16.290] - Speaker 1
Did you already know you were going to do art or no?

[00:45:19.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I just like doing things. I did photography and some art stuff before. I worked while the theater was interesting to me, I worked with dad a bit. Then when I went to Amsterdam, I thought I'm doing art. Then I bumped into some guy told me, There is a school that gives you money in the studio. Then I went to that school. Knocked on the door. I had some drawings I made. I put the drawings in a box. And the night before I walked back, a woman walked by, it was heavily perfumed. I just thought, that's a good way to get attention. I put all this perfume on my application. So you have a olfactory thing. That's what... Interesting. And then they called on the phone, home. They called and said, Yeah, you can come in. And then I went there. And they said somebody just left because they had It was like 10 people a year. It was like some postgraduate program. I know it was not postgraduate, it was 19, and just didn't really finish anything before. Then that was my introduction. Then I first time dealt with people that were educated through art schools and so on.

[00:46:36.580] - Speaker 1
Was that good or bad?

[00:46:38.280] - Speaker 2
That was very enlightening. I'm glad I didn't start there. For me, it felt like a shock. You see, there were some dudes that weren't totally... Back then, I think there was just the tail end of Julian Schnabel being a dominating figure in painting, in perception for younger people. There were these few older dudes that were fighting to be this very masculine, large canvas guys. Then there were some people that had some conceptual things and some keep painting some figuration. Each had their little pocket and they knew exactly what they do. They had an idea of a career path, a gallery or a museum. It was all educated. If you were coming through the side door, you can just look at it. You're in it. I'm really glad that they...

[00:47:35.700] - Speaker 1
Would you say you've always felt like an outsider?

[00:47:40.090] - Speaker 2
I don't know. Never thought about it this way. I think of it a little bit the other way around. I think a lot of this education and this stuff is alien.

[00:47:51.510] - Speaker 1
I see.

[00:47:53.300] - Speaker 2
You know what I mean?

[00:47:54.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you're saying-I think it's to celebrate your life.

[00:47:57.270] - Speaker 2
I don't understand in various I don't understand this need to quantify that as a lot of education in the arts does.

[00:48:08.070] - Speaker 1
It's not as free as you see the possibilities. Is that a way to say it?

[00:48:14.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, it's very narrow. Some of it is extremely narrow. I don't know why one would want to engage in that.

[00:48:21.640] - Speaker 1
I guess if you believe that's what it is, if you learn that early enough, you think that's what it is. You're I'm saying that you have the advantage of not having the blinders put on you early.

[00:48:37.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah, totally. I think if you're just surrounded by people that say things and think they are part of it. I mean, it's always belonging, too. The way I understand it, there's a lot of fear and you want to do the right thing and you want to be like your peers in some way and you want to be part. I don't totally understand. But I I do know I don't understand art education.

[00:49:02.430] - Speaker 1
You think it can be taught?

[00:49:05.360] - Speaker 2
Back to synergy. I think there are always pockets, as we all know, in any creative or artistic or even business or whatever. There is always pockets of people. It's hardly ever meet the solitaire. It's always these little things. And what leads to this situation to be fertile, so many factors, we don't know, but it's like then things develop. And it is probably one way of how you can facilitate a chance that you have. I mean, you always have an experience, but that this experience could be really cross-pollinating and do more. But I'm sure you know better than most people, you cannot force magic.

[00:49:55.720] - Speaker 1
You can't force anything.

[00:49:57.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm sure people come to you and they want some magic. Give me some magic. It's like, good luck. It doesn't work that way. It can't help you there.

[00:50:05.630] - Speaker 1
What was your first tattoo?

[00:50:07.370] - Speaker 2
A little dot here.

[00:50:09.370] - Speaker 1
A dot?

[00:50:10.570] - Speaker 2
This little dot when you're just taking a fountain pen. But then I had a I saw some lion here, some heraldic lion, and something. I was totally dumb. I'm like, I'm not-How old were you when you got the dot?

[00:50:26.230] - Speaker 1
The first?

[00:50:26.930] - Speaker 2
The dot, I've probably, I don't know, 12 or something. I totally forget that I have the tooth. I have to tell you, I literally forget.

[00:50:37.590] - Speaker 1
How was living in New York different than living in Europe?

[00:50:41.980] - Speaker 2
It was more welcoming as a non-native person. I think that in general about living in North America is my experience as not being from here is such that there are many people that are not from here or there's different histories and nobody's really from anywhere. Some people think they are, but it leaves more room. And if I live where I try to live somewhere in Europe, not just to visit or spend some time of the year once you go somewhere and you're younger and you realize, so you will never be English, you will never be Dutch, you will never be whatever, French, Italian. You will never be that. That's usually after two years whenever I started to leave. In New York, I did not have that experience. I thought I actually become more part of it. The longer I was there, almost to the point where you're like, It's good to get out. I had this theory at first when I moved there. In Zurich, where I grew up, the people that went to New York in the or early '90s, a lot of them were very ambitious, and some of them were a little bit of assholes.

[00:52:07.410] - Speaker 2
I always imagined that city must be a hub for people with too much ambition and this and that. I never had a fantasy to move there. So my fantasy was always to move to California. And coming from a medieval city, I like the idea this is the end of Western civilization, not the old, old, baked-in version. So that it's... But then once I moved to New York, it's similar. It felt similar then when I first got into art where you see all these things, all these where you can you pop in and you see books and other sources of information, things in real or people, where you realize you can be part of something. It felt to me still like there is a lot of history. Going When you were in there, it felt like you're not just a bunch of kids doing something. You're part of a long history. That was really great to be part of or to feel that you partake in that somewhat.

[00:53:12.620] - Speaker 1
You feel like there's an artistic community there?

[00:53:16.090] - Speaker 2
Now?

[00:53:16.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:53:17.730] - Speaker 2
I'm sure, yeah, there are communities.

[00:53:20.030] - Speaker 1
Ongoing.

[00:53:21.060] - Speaker 2
Ongoing. But we also have people that are 80 that once did something or people 70, 60, 50. You have from all in different dimensions, directions, interactions, and they're all there. It's a very rich network of histories and also of self-mythologizing creatures on top of each other. It gives what you do context and makes you feel what you do has a purpose. If that's true or not, it doesn't matter. But it's a feeling of you're not just in somewhere, middle of nowhere, doing something, and then maybe get sent out. And you're like, What is that? Yeah.

[00:54:09.920] - Speaker 1
And the California experience, how's that been for you?

[00:54:13.220] - Speaker 2
Oh, I just love being out Yeah. I'm outdoor. Even in the winter, I have puffy jackets and blankets and heaters. Yeah. In this part of my life, that makes more sense to be closer to nature, but still be in an urban place than to be in a lot of noise.

[00:54:36.080] - Speaker 1
Have you experimented at all with technology?

[00:54:40.370] - Speaker 2
Always, yeah. I mean, what technology?

[00:54:43.430] - Speaker 1
I guess we'll say digital because I guess there's physical technology, too.

[00:54:49.480] - Speaker 2
Most things I do go through a computer at some point in various ways, either in conception or in production. I made some robotic chairs a few years back. I don't know when that was. Maybe 2018, '19. So there was some free roaming. I don't know if you ever saw that.

[00:55:10.350] - Speaker 1
I've never seen them. They're chairs that move around?

[00:55:13.630] - Speaker 2
Their chairs, their office chairs. I mean, it's totally crazy technology. They make no sound when they move. And the battery, they go and charge themselves. But they're all just one office chair. They have different colors and the free roaming robots. And they are programmed to have different. And they have about nine sensors built in. I spend the townhouse on those. Totally dumb. But they have different personalities. The way they react to people.

[00:55:41.240] - Speaker 1
Do you think of them like pets?

[00:55:43.130] - Speaker 2
No, it was more like that. It started with the idea of humans and patterns, like how we are working in patterns. So we say you approach somebody and they're very nice. The next time you approach and you expect, you always read what to expect. And some people have a personality where that's shifting, and they mess up a lot of things. And so I wanted to make this. It's nine office chairs, and they move around. I wanted them to build the expectation. And also, in a way, as a human, have your expectation project. Oh, I know how this works. You approach it, it goes away. You approach it, it It goes away. You approach it, it stands still. You approach it again, it goes away. Then you think it's a glitch. You approach it again, and then it approaches you. You have a very hard time reading what's going on. Yeah. You know? Yeah. And very quickly, you can create some confusion. So that didn't totally work out because at the time, we had a little bit of a lag, just a little bit too long for people that went. Because what happens, people go first slow, then they go think it doesn't work, then they go fast, then they go slow, and then the chair reacts.

[00:57:04.550] - Speaker 2
Then with a little tiny time lag, you're already not in sync with the people's reaction. It didn't totally function on this level. Then they did some choreographies together, and I can show you. You want to see that? Yeah, please. I have two videos. It's great.

[00:57:26.100] - Speaker 1
It's so funny. They're very ordinary-looking chairs. They look like the chairs you'd see in any office.

[00:57:35.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but there is two motors per wheel. There is a chip that we have some import problems because you can use it to guide a rocket. There is all the technologies inside this chair. It's hidden, and they don't make a sound. Then the seat cushion is actually the battery that we have made. There is a robotic thing where they go drive in and charge themselves, and they all know where they They know where the people are. I mean, by now, we could probably do much better than this.

[00:58:05.180] - Speaker 1
It's so cool.

[00:58:06.850] - Speaker 2
Then we assigned micro movements. They can go 30 miles an hour. Wow. If you have one glitch, they could It could be dangerous. Yeah. That's all remade. This is not the real chair. This is all remade.

[00:58:21.900] - Speaker 1
So cool-looking.

[00:58:23.020] - Speaker 2
Then they do choreographies together. When there is a room, soon they see a room, they find each other, then they do choreographies.

[00:58:30.280] - Speaker 1
It's a funny idea to think about when the office closes and everybody leaves, that this is what happens.

[00:58:36.360] - Speaker 2
See, when somebody goes slow, you can actually do that with them. But with the timeline, they get confused. If you're confused, then you know. Then They have affinities to each other or not. It's pretty complex. The title is Play. I always thought it's interesting because you can watch animals play. You don't need to be a human to play.

[00:59:00.430] - Speaker 1
From the inception, tell me the process of getting from the idea to get into that.

[00:59:06.740] - Speaker 2
I had some idea some years earlier for that. There was a table that just moves around. Whenever you go in the space, the table, it will go away, it will come to you and this and that. Because I saw some cars when you back up, you have these little sensors. I thought that's easy to do. And it wasn't. Then I forgot about it. I At some point, I was thinking about it again and I called a friend of mine who has nothing to do with robotics, but he's very smart. Then we did this in one and a half years, the whole production and everything.

[00:59:46.980] - Speaker 1
Are the ideas ever based on a new technology you see and then you see an application, or is it always the dream of what it could be first and then figuring out how to technically make it happen?

[00:59:58.930] - Speaker 2
It's more like you try, you inform what you see in the real world, maybe in this way, but you don't know how it works, but you think it should be possible to push that and apply that in a different context. Just backing up cars and cameras and sensors. Why can't we put that in something else? Then the other thing is a vocabulary. I mean, things you have done before, like when we do a lot of things now, you scan stuff or any how you go about or to work with data, you have a vocabulary of what you know is possible. That informs the way you think about it. For example, often with a work, I just lay around and then I think about something or it comes from wherever. It's just there. Then I go through the whole process of how it's made one step by step. For I pre-made the entire thing in my mind with all the technical complications and everything. Then it's finished in this way and then you make it. Then when you make it, it, logically, it doesn't turn out exactly like how you imagine it, and then you deal with that part.

[01:01:21.520] - Speaker 1
Does that whole process happen before you ever, say, write it down or draw something?

[01:01:29.200] - Speaker 2
It's a funny question because it's the same when people say they write their diaries and they do it by hand, of how that affects your thinking and what you write and how it's part of your life. When you write, the fact that you're thinking is much faster than you writing that sentence is a good thing sometimes. But then what I don't like personally about writing is that it has to somewhat make sense. You You start with a sentence and it goes to the next sentence, and then you put yourself a bit into a corner. I see. And then how you get out of there. The other thing is more... It's also more for three-dimensional things where you have to... The production or your whole... How it comes into life where you need to fold that in early.

[01:02:20.610] - Speaker 1
For a sculpture, is there a point where you build a small model?

[01:02:28.190] - Speaker 2
Hardly ever, no. It's the same with notes. I make a lot of notes, but my notes are really messy. They're not accurate drawings.

[01:02:37.570] - Speaker 1
But you know what they mean or they help you remember things?

[01:02:40.820] - Speaker 2
I used to make lots of them, and I plaster my walls with them. Then I thought of it as a three-dimensional model of ideas and how they interconnect and so on. But then I realized I never look at them again. Never. Then I had boxes full of that stuff. Then I stopped doing them. Now, recently, the last year, I got back into it, but I never look at that stuff again.

[01:03:03.260] - Speaker 1
Do you think art is meant to be seen next to other art?

[01:03:10.280] - Speaker 2
You mean physically?

[01:03:11.680] - Speaker 1
Physically.

[01:03:13.710] - Speaker 2
It can. I mean, I don't mind it. I'm not mad at it.

[01:03:16.810] - Speaker 1
Does it change anything? Does it...

[01:03:18.600] - Speaker 2
Context changes everything. Yeah, always. I mean, it's even like in your brain when you look at something, you think you already bring context into everything. Yeah. Some stuff looks way better when you combine it.

[01:03:35.420] - Speaker 1
Has your work ever been censored?

[01:03:38.650] - Speaker 2
Has it? The last time I got some slack was we put up this big sculpture in the center of Moscow and Like a huge outdoor sculpture, I don't know, 45 feet or whatever in the center of the city. It got singled out by some more right parts in politics as weird things. It obstructs the basilisk of the thing or whatever, a liberal turd, or now this comes to our city, whatever. But it's not my work. It's ridiculous. I mean, there There's a lot of problems there, and it's definitely not in a piece of metal.

[01:04:21.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You made pieces that are wax and they're candles, essentially?

[01:04:32.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, they work like a candle. Wasn't in the beginning. I mean, it started like, I always like when they light a candle for something or somebody. It's like a flame or I think a lot of us think about flames as like some of the flame of life or like a soul or like there's something to fire that I don't know what it is, but I always see fire as something all Yeah. So I just put in some sculptures, I just put a regular household candle just to because I thought it maybe needs to be alive. So you put that there and then all of a sudden the thing becomes alive. If you think you have your office chair there and you put a candle on that, then that chair becomes like something else. So it's a way. And then it shifted from there. I said, Why not make a whole thing out of it as a candle? At the beginning, I carved these female figures, like more traditional. I had no clue what I was doing. More traditional art idea. It felt like a nude, somewhat figure is the most simplest figure that doesn't need to be somebody.

[01:05:55.010] - Speaker 2
Some years later, there was this guy, Peter Brandt. I don't know if you who he is, is a collector, and he's married with Stephanie Seymour, and they have... They commissioned various artists to make portraits of her. One is Mauritia Cotillan did, Julian did a portrait and different people. And I I offered, I have a portrait in mind, and it was a portrait of Peter Brand. And this is just when the scanning technology for people, like to scan human bodies, was somewhat mobile enough that We could work with this technology. And it was a portrait of Peter standing behind this chair, and the chair was empty. And that was my portrait of her because all the other artists made a portrait of her. I thought there is something he's also in there. I wanted to call the piece Stephanie. I made a show at the Brand Foundation, at the Family Foundation in Connecticut. And that piece was a part of the works in there, but they separated in that time. And so I couldn't call the piece Stephanie anymore. I thought that would just feel bad. Then It was just Peter. Out of that came these portraits.

[01:07:21.560] - Speaker 2
And then the next thing at the time, I shared a studio with Rudi Stingel. And then I wanted to make a portrait of him. Then I wanted to make a portrait of him. Then I thought, because he grew up in Italy, in Northern Italy, all the history, this European history. Then I thought he should be with a big sculpture of a pressing old European art history big thing. That got out of hands. That thing became very big. Then I wanted to put something Something else that's totally not thinking this way. The thing is ergonomic. There's an office chair, actually the same one I use for the robots because it has an ergonomic design that doesn't go by the same esthetic principle. I just had that to walk a pile, like some space around it. That's how that came about. Then I got into it whenever I met somebody that I felt has the resting position, pretty much. Carries an image. One friend of mine, I made a thing of this guy, Adam McEwen, a good friend of mine, but he's tall and he often looks down. So he's a bit more like a shoegazer. He feels some the thought, the weight of thought always in his posture.

[01:08:46.160] - Speaker 2
It's not that it's about him being this way. It's more like an image of that. He just shows them where I made this portrait of Julian Schnabel and it sits on this crate. That was my image of Julian in a way. It's like this. On one side, it's like a boy sitting by a pier fishing. But then if you look from underneath, it's also like a pedestal, you're on there and you... That's great. That's just these images of people. So all these portraits are basically candles. That's what it meant. From putting a a candle on top of it to putting then making the whole... Making it out of a candle. Making it out of wax or a candle. So make the sculpture as the candle instead of putting a topper on it.

[01:09:41.470] - Speaker 1
Now, do you do that by sculpting into the wax or do you melt the wax and pour it into a form?

[01:09:49.900] - Speaker 2
You make a negative and you brush in the surface, all the different colors into the half or multi-parts. Then that gets faken up, combined, and then we turn it upside down and fill it with the wax. I see.

[01:10:04.100] - Speaker 1
So the color is actually in the wax.

[01:10:06.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's brushed into the mold. When you take the mold away, then it's basically in there. It's part of the body. It's not applied after.

[01:10:19.920] - Speaker 1
Do you ever make more than one candle out of the same mold?

[01:10:23.030] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you can. Well, it'll last about five, six runs a mold.

[01:10:28.890] - Speaker 1
Pretty cool.

[01:10:29.910] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's good. The good thing is you can burn it down.

[01:10:34.860] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:10:36.280] - Speaker 2
Then you can make a new one.

[01:10:38.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:10:39.720] - Speaker 2
It doesn't age. It doesn't have the problem of aging, which everything in the physical world has the problem of aging.

[01:10:45.520] - Speaker 1
Do any of them live not burned?

[01:10:49.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it costs a fortune to recast them. That's an expensive hobby to light that thing up.

[01:11:00.000] - Speaker 1
I read a story somewhere that you had a plan to build a bed for a show, but it ended up becoming a horse. Does that sound familiar?

[01:11:13.440] - Speaker 2
A horse? It's a horse bed. I don't know. That doesn't sound familiar, but what it was, it was like a horse and carriage. I was thinking about this feeling of stuff that goes through you where you're defenseless, like that hurt you. Not the of that you can let things pass through you and it feels fine, where you feel overwhelmed. That can be sounds or whatever. Or you try push a kid on a stroller in Manhattan in the winter and the cars, they're on the car level and just the hunking, the anger, the anxiety that comes at you. Just this feeling of overwhelming and how everything passes through you. You are the sum of all this. You're only part you and you're a lot of other parts. I wanted to make a sculpture that embodies this as a thing. I had the first idea was I have a horse with a carriage as something that I need the protagonist, and it's a bit technical. I wanted the protagonist that implies movement and not object. So it's a horse. I like the horse and the carriage because it was very light. It's not like a heavy object that sits on the ground because it's it's lifted up into the air.

[01:12:44.380] - Speaker 2
The horse and the carriage would have been pierced by about 30 things. And so these 30 things, the biggest one was a hospital bed. And that came from because I spent next to somebody that was laying in a hospital bed. So like 10 days, not really sleeping, just making sure they're okay. And you look at this weird thing that a lot of people come in and out of the world on this strange machine that massages and weighs and folds. I don't know what it does. But I thought that's definitely needs to be part of it. Then I wanted to make the things. We scanned all these objects, carriages, and it became just too big and too expensive to do. Then I just took the horse and the hospital bed and I combined them. They looked like they want to belong together. It's all one body. You see, it's made out of... I mean, it's multiple parts. It's all milled aluminum. It's a carving. So they become one.

[01:13:54.050] - Speaker 1
How do you make something like this?

[01:13:56.350] - Speaker 2
You scan everything and then you have to texture it.

[01:13:58.820] - Speaker 1
Then When you're scanning it, are you scanning it from images or from what are you- Three-dimensional thing.

[01:14:05.320] - Speaker 2
I bought a bed like this. We take it apart. We scan.

[01:14:11.300] - Speaker 1
You start with a physical object. You scan the physical object, and then you put it together digitally.

[01:14:18.100] - Speaker 2
Digitly. Then you-Reproduce it. Then you reproduce it. We need an engineer for all the leverage and weight. This is milled out of an aluminum that this doesn't oxidize That's like a special type of Alloy. I didn't want any seams, so they're just little hairlines and some parts are pretty insane, too. Then it bogged me that I didn't make that carriage thing, but I didn't want to use the horse. Then I made a version where it's not one thing. Just back to what you asked earlier, if you come back to an idea, where you have multiple objects, so where you have more that whole experience of all these things that They look, they fly like nothing touches the ground, but it's a trick with the gravity, but it stands on the rhinos.

[01:15:05.720] - Speaker 1
It's almost like a series of arrows sticking out of an animal.

[01:15:08.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's like a fancy bastion.

[01:15:10.800] - Speaker 1
One's a laptop and one's a chair.

[01:15:13.520] - Speaker 2
One is a big printer. It's just like a selection of random shit, basically.

[01:15:22.170] - Speaker 1
When you're digitally composing it, do you move the objects around?

[01:15:29.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So a little here, a little there till I think it looks good.

[01:15:32.780] - Speaker 1
You can move around it when you're building it. 3d rendering. It seems like technically you get to learn about a lot of materials and how to make stuff. There's a lot that goes into this beyond this is a cool-looking object now.

[01:15:51.680] - Speaker 2
It's pretty intense, technically. There is even a level where I don't understand much about with engineers of how you crane that up and how you interlock all that stuff.

[01:16:03.020] - Speaker 1
The fact that it's difficult to build, is that ever daunting or does it ever get in the way of execution?

[01:16:12.820] - Speaker 2
It does, but It also gets in the way of being economical about it all because I have a hard time.

[01:16:21.610] - Speaker 1
If it costs too much, you can't even...

[01:16:24.750] - Speaker 2
I try to do it.

[01:16:26.390] - Speaker 1
You find a way.

[01:16:28.110] - Speaker 2
I find a way. Usually, it works out, but it's not an economical way of going about anything. It's really somewhat bit extremist or obsessive or whatever.

[01:16:43.180] - Speaker 1
Do you think that the place impacts your work? Either the place you live or the place you are when you're making something?

[01:16:50.050] - Speaker 2
Guaranteed. I wouldn't know how. In some of it, you know how, and some of it, I wouldn't totally understand how. No place matters so much, and also who you work with. One place I think that matters almost most is what feedback you get on what you do. And that can be a dialog with a friend. That can be a bit more a bigger excitement. You feel people are excited by something that don't even... My dream is always to make things where you don't have to know the artist. It's just If people encounter something weird or something that stimulates them, whatever form, and the work does the job. That can feel good when you have a moment like that. Just working in a vacuum and not knowing where things go is something I cannot do. I always work for a show, a purpose, place. Otherwise, I don't see the reason to make the thing.

[01:18:06.210] - Speaker 1
The things right now, what are you working on right now?

[01:18:09.760] - Speaker 2
Furniture.

[01:18:10.760] - Speaker 1
What's the purpose of it, specifically?

[01:18:15.960] - Speaker 2
What is the purpose of anything? I don't know. The purpose is I was asked if I want to make a furniture show, and I love furniture.

[01:18:26.710] - Speaker 1
Will it be used as furniture?

[01:18:28.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah, totally. It It's just like it's an interesting endeavor because when you're not from a place, let's say, I think, if I understand it right, in architecture and design, they have so much history on how it's made and this and that. Then so they think this way, if you just do something, you're pretty free. It doesn't need to make sense. It comes more from the fact that the physical object, there is only one place on Earth. The pen you have in your hand, there's only one. This space that's occupied by that pen is occupied by that pen or whatever, that tree. If you think of sculptures, they clutter places in some way, which is some part I really don't like about the field of work. I mean, that we use up a lot of space.

[01:19:25.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it takes up space.

[01:19:27.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Instead of an idea or an image or a song, there is no space to it, which is beautiful. In that, I just thought, let's say I have a whole bunch of sculptures. They're all in storage, not my own work, other people's, mostly in storage because my house is small and I don't want to expand it. I don't see no purpose having it in the house. But I do love furniture. If it's comfortable and if it's fun.

[01:19:57.120] - Speaker 1
It's functional, it'll work in your life and you get to be around it.

[01:20:01.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it looks cool. Some of it looks cool. For example, one is this human figure. It was more underachieness. Now it became a more female figure. So this thing, just a little context, that's about 80 something inches. That's a little taller than a human, and it's all out of foam. This will be coded, covered. But this is the foam, so you can actually sit on the arm. I see. You can sit on the figure. You can sit on all parts.

[01:20:35.040] - Speaker 1
It's a sculpture that works as a piece of furniture.

[01:20:39.370] - Speaker 2
Yeah, this one. Then other ones are sometimes more conservative.

[01:20:44.180] - Speaker 1
That's really cool. How was your work first noticed?

[01:20:50.000] - Speaker 2
I studied some photography stuff, more in an arts and crafts type school. I always got really into the project. Then we had some people teaching there or somehow that gave me some feedback, you see the people react or whatever. Then usually with, let's say I went to the school in Amsterdam and there was this other artist there and you do something and they look for dialog and you see you get some feedback. It's a very small notice, but it gives you something. Usually, all came through other artists, primarily in the beginning.

[01:21:36.990] - Speaker 1
Was there a breakthrough moment? Was there a time where it's like now it's different than it was before?

[01:21:42.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah, there was one moment. I was maybe 21 or something. I did my first show in a gallery.

[01:21:49.590] - Speaker 1
Is it in Amsterdam?

[01:21:50.750] - Speaker 2
No, that was in Zurich. The show was in Zurich. After I had that show, I was not the same as the other kids I hung out with because you're the one that has a little success. That's the biggest thing. The biggest change I noticed ever was you're now one of those.

[01:22:08.920] - Speaker 1
Was it how they looked at you or how you looked at yourself that changed?

[01:22:12.630] - Speaker 2
How I felt being looked at. I mean, what do I know? It's assumptions of who they are. But how I felt I'm looked at or seen. You stop being a little bit you and you are perceived a little bit as to somebody who makes something.

[01:22:34.370] - Speaker 1
Would you say it gave you more confidence or not necessarily?

[01:22:38.440] - Speaker 2
No, it made me insecure for a while. I really didn't know how to... It felt alienating. I mean, you also... Sometimes you are just you, and in some context, you are you as the person who makes X, Y, Z. I'm a total piece with both of that by now. Oh, yeah. It's not conflicting.

[01:23:01.830] - Speaker 1
When does a piece of work go from an experiment to a finished piece? At what point in the process?

[01:23:10.970] - Speaker 2
On a good day. On a good day is when you don't know what to add anymore. And on a bad day, it's just... Give up? You give up a bit on it. It's like, I'm sorry. It's as good as you get. I don't have it in me today, and I don't want to continue tomorrow.

[01:23:35.800] - Speaker 1
Tell me how the art business works.

[01:23:40.610] - Speaker 2
I have a lot of experiences. I'm not capable of tell you how it works, but one thing is, why does one need to own something? Why do you want to own this or that? There's There are people that I met, few, where I really understood what collecting means. And that's not buying stuff to put in your house. Some people can be very obsessive. They have thousands of things, and they know everything about each piece and each context. They're so knowledgeable, and they basically tell the story.

[01:24:28.860] - Speaker 1
That's really the audience, essentially.

[01:24:33.110] - Speaker 2
No, that's not the audience. That's just part of, I think, what created this art market. I see. Is these people. They tell a story I know, for example, there's different people, but somebody like Bruno Bischofberger, who was the guy that was always on the cover or back cover of the Art Forum, or a person that's been around from the '60s to now, when I was an older man, old men, but they collected so many things, 10,000 of things. Every conversation I have with him, he just tells me all these stories about whatever, from some folk art in some 17th century to whatever. He knows everything, encyclopedic, and he puts it together. He started with a lot of things that then later became very desirable or collected. He started so many things early. The whole conversation is just this thing, this, and then he did only this and then that artist. It's a bizarre amount of information and knowledge. I sometimes help hanging shows. There was one collector, he collect only things that happened in New York. He does that since the mid '60s. Basically, he is like a... I always think of him as a fisherman that goes to the shore and you just see a little ripple and you think, Okay, I go there.

[01:26:11.790] - Speaker 2
Some other things can be very loud. That's just noise because he has so much discipline and experience and a real passion. So we hang works. Obviously, I put one work here and one work there. I said, well, in 1987, this work was hanging to that thing. That's how it was first shown by the art. Like a really in-depth knowledge. So how that matters with the art market, I think there were always people that had a knowledge and a connoisseurship. The way I imagine, you see these things in somebody's house and it's awesome. I said, I want that too. The prices of some of these things is absurd. It makes no sense because you don't actually get a physical value for any... It's like what is a Mungo painting wharf? You get a little bit of wood, some really old canvas, and you get nothing. It is just what somebody is willing to pay for it, basically.

[01:27:20.880] - Speaker 1
For the fact that there's a market around it.

[01:27:23.030] - Speaker 2
And there's a market around it. And in a way that these figures in this market or whatever, like some being back to Van Gogh, everybody knows what that is. So you put it in your house, it's also you have a Van Gogh in your house. And historically, you did well with these... If you bought one 40 years ago, you did a good deal. So you don't lose anything. You have something to look at.

[01:27:47.680] - Speaker 1
It's an investment that holds its value.

[01:27:50.710] - Speaker 2
Potentially. Yeah. How these prices came in the last 20 years or 30 years or maybe starting in the '80s or something. I'm I'm not totally notable in that. It is not old stuff. It's new stuff that is made to say this is going to be a potential future artifact of value. It's a bad Yeah. But then I had a phase where I collected. So I was hooked.

[01:28:22.660] - Speaker 1
Tell me about that. How did it start? What was the first piece you bought?

[01:28:26.770] - Speaker 2
Well, first I traded with friends of mine always, and then you hang it in your house. Then I started buying the galleries that I worked with. And you go in some offices and see this thing and that thing, and you have one, and then you want more of that same artist, and then you want the ones you got. And then the other ones will be better. You think you need to have those two, and from there on it goes. Then you have hundreds of things, and you're like, I don't know what to do with it. One way, what I felt at that time was I'm a high-end hoarder. You're a hoarder of interesting, valuable things, but you're still, nonetheless, you're a hoarder.

[01:29:10.380] - Speaker 1
I read that you once had a gallery, Lower the ceiling for your show?

[01:29:18.980] - Speaker 2
Sounds like it would be possible. I don't remember. I got out of that vibe.

[01:29:25.740] - Speaker 1
But what would be the reason for it? Tell me the thinking, whether you would do it or not now is less That's the point.

[01:29:33.010] - Speaker 2
It's all about making the work look good, and that's always in context. If you put the thing in the right context, it can actually unfold and be itself. It can become something. Let's say a wall is very tall and you have a smaller thing...

[01:29:56.920] - Speaker 1
In front of it.

[01:29:58.770] - Speaker 2
Hanging on it. I see. It will just fly. It will feel lost.

[01:30:02.260] - Speaker 1
The work will be dwarfed by the height of the wall. Yeah.

[01:30:05.170] - Speaker 2
That's another thing. It's totally bizarre. In my field of work, the galleries are ginormous. Yeah.

[01:30:14.200] - Speaker 1
But people's homes are not as big as the galleries.

[01:30:16.420] - Speaker 2
No. People start... Some of our artist studios are ginormous, and then they make, like me included, ginormous things. But what's the freaking point here? It's just the context. Because if you make a show some here. This is the way it looks right or feels right. But then what do you do with it after? It's like, I don't totally clock the whole thing.

[01:30:39.590] - Speaker 1
Tell me the feeling, though, when you've worked on something in a rendering, and let's say you know the final version is going to be 40 feet tall.

[01:30:50.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:30:51.010] - Speaker 1
What's it like the first time you see the 40-foot version?

[01:30:55.710] - Speaker 2
I only see mistakes in the...

[01:30:59.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You only see what's wrong. Yeah. Your breath has never taken away with, Wow, look at that.

[01:31:05.910] - Speaker 2
It happened a few times, but on average, it's... What's wrong? My God.

[01:31:11.260] - Speaker 1
The things that you're seeing and saying, my God, about that or wrong, probably no one else would notice.

[01:31:19.200] - Speaker 2
No. I will notice even on somebody else's. Yes, exactly. But I always think if something is unfinished or there is a mistake, if somebody Nobody really wants to find a mistake, let them have one. We got to reward the people that need to find the mistake. That's how I trick myself into getting over it.

[01:31:46.040] - Speaker 1
Who's to say what's a mistake?

[01:31:48.400] - Speaker 2
You can tell an insecurity in something. I mean, this is a mistake, no, but what one would call a mistake, it's just... Sometimes This was a shortcut. It didn't go all the way.

[01:32:05.770] - Speaker 1
Are you always working?

[01:32:07.650] - Speaker 2
Yes. But to me, it makes no difference. I can bake a cake or I can... I just always need to do something. Making something. Yeah.

[01:32:18.620] - Speaker 1
Have you done any multimedia work?

[01:32:22.500] - Speaker 2
Very little.

[01:32:24.440] - Speaker 1
Ever film?

[01:32:26.060] - Speaker 2
I made a film when I was like 20, 21 or something.

[01:32:30.340] - Speaker 1
Was that a good experience?

[01:32:32.850] - Speaker 2
I liked it. I was just broke after because I financed it myself. I was broke for like half a year after that. Then I had that film and I didn't know what to do with it. That was interesting, the whole process. But I'm not a moving image person, I believe. I think moving images is one thing I could do that. I don't like narratives. I mean, I like them okay.

[01:33:00.810] - Speaker 1
It's not your thing.

[01:33:04.230] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no. I mean, even to watch, I have the longer, the more harder time watching TV or movies or something.

[01:33:13.390] - Speaker 1
What are the things that you find comfort in watching?

[01:33:18.710] - Speaker 2
Really mindless. Can be okay. That's almost a form of meditation to me. You empty your brain. It's not you sit there depressed. It's just really just nothing here. I watched recently something. What was it called? Adolescence or something. It was a short. It's like a mini-series, five episodes on Netflix written by one of the main actors. It's not fun to watch, but each episode is filmed. You have a story of this one act by one son in a family, adolescent, and how it affects the family. It's like first you're like, one day after or a few hours after that thing. It's always real time. The whole episode is filmed in one shot. So it's like a play. You go in a car and you go there. So they're rehearsed and then the emotions go up and down. You go in. And so then you're three days after. Then you are three months Then you are, whatever, a year after and a year and a half after. So that was really smart. You watch it and you're like... I didn't read what it is. And then you realize this shop never ends. That's a more technical thing, but just the emotions, the range.

[01:34:49.150] - Speaker 2
And it really felt like a substantial experience. And that somebody can put that as an entertainment, this thing. A lot of respect for that.

[01:35:01.720] - Speaker 1
What's the most beautiful place you've ever been?

[01:35:06.310] - Speaker 2
It's by or at the sea or ocean. That I know. But then I have a lot of-Many choices. Yeah.

[01:35:14.920] - Speaker 1
Name a couple that you like.

[01:35:17.640] - Speaker 2
I had really beautiful times in Greece, the water or the sun setting by the water or like this. This colors are very different and smells are different. Then Yeah, if you hear that sometimes in the Caribbean, there is a place of being this smoothness to the water and the wind and also the light, the temperature not fluctuating much. I mean, that works for me. And some islands when the anxiety is far away.

[01:35:53.470] - Speaker 1
Tell me something that you believe now that you didn't believe when you were young.

[01:36:01.320] - Speaker 2
That life is way crazier than anything somebody can imagine, like in where everything goes since I'm a kid. And the other thing, peace, that you can find some form of peace within yourself or love, like how that feels.

[01:36:20.970] - Speaker 1
Was there a time when you were young where you doubted you would ever feel those?

[01:36:26.000] - Speaker 2
See, I grew up with a lot of anxiety, not only my own, but everybody around me. Or in my case, I definitely mistook anxiety for love because that's what you grow up with. It's not that you can have both for somebody, but it's like when it comes in a fused package, it...

[01:36:49.340] - Speaker 1
Confusing.

[01:36:50.430] - Speaker 2
It's confusing to extract the anxiety and then just have the love and to let that be.

[01:36:58.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:37:00.630] - Speaker 2
Pretty cool.

[01:37:01.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah. What are your parents like?

[01:37:05.350] - Speaker 2
They're very nice people. I don't think they were good parents, but they were very nice people. Yeah. You know? And They're still around. I mean, my dad is now Alzheimer's and he's going, that stuff. But two people that didn't have easy lives. A lot of family traumas and stuff, hard times. They carried all that with them into their young relationship. They stayed together all their life. They're still together. Fifty, whatever years, or eight years, something like that.

[01:37:46.730] - Speaker 1
When was the last time you were in Zurich?

[01:37:49.340] - Speaker 2
About a month and a half ago to visit them.

[01:37:51.950] - Speaker 1
Has changed a lot since you were growing up?

[01:37:54.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:37:55.180] - Speaker 1
In what ways?

[01:37:56.940] - Speaker 2
Like most cities, it just cleans up somehow, and a lot of the funky interesting stuff fades away or gets replaced or everything needs to make enough money. There's no crappy old cafés anymore. They're all new and look the same than any other. That part I miss. I miss old, rotten facades and buildings and like a little...

[01:38:28.260] - Speaker 1
You would love New York in the '70s.

[01:38:30.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:38:33.810] - Speaker 1
It's not like that anymore.

[01:38:35.880] - Speaker 2
No, it's crazy. I mean, that place really changed so much. Unbelievable, though..
