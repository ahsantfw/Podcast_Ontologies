[00:00:08.650] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammatin. Tetragrammat. Tetragrammatin.

[00:00:23.410] - Speaker 2
I think if you do a think for a really long time, you can get into anything, can be by rote. You can get to the place where you're doing things kind of beautifully, unconsciously, and then you can get to where you're maybe on autopilot, and the right kind of instinctive and unconscious is wonderful. And then there's that thing where I don't want to say phoning it in, because I hope I've never done that, but where you're too familiar with a set of moves. And I definitely am approaching a place where I almost feel that, I'm not really sure I remember what I'm supposed to do or how I'm supposed to approach it, and I'm kind of happy about that. But I think if I kind of stand back from it all, I think that when it's working really well, you feel like you're channeling something through that. Yeah. You might have just like a musician or you've done the work and the craft work to create the conduits that you're accessing the channel through, but that you've tapped into something where you're not having to. Yeah, you're letting something go through you that's not you.

[00:01:46.290] - Speaker 2
And I think at the center of it is empathy. I kind of think if an actor can't anchor themselves in real empathy, there's nothing really good. There might be performative kind of bullshit or comedy or humor or whatever, but for me, it's kind of like you got to get to a place where you're trying to seek some sort of a deep understanding of a different person's experience and what flows out of it in interesting ways. But ultimately, I think that's empathy.

[00:02:23.780] - Speaker 3
When you're in it, do you know you're in it?

[00:02:28.190] - Speaker 2
I think sometimes, because the times that I know that, I've felt really good, something unbidden is happening, something unplanned or really great. Film director and one of my real mentors in life, Milosh Foreman, used to call it the unrepeatable moment, the thing that even with all the cameras and all the artifice and the rehearsals, if there were some or the fact that it's the fifth take or anything, that something happens that is just sort of unrepeatable and blooms not out of a conscious plan. And those things can be really delightful when they happen and make you feel like, this is good. I think the other thing is that, and this isn't in no way, my own original observation. But listening is really, really important because listening is just another word for being really genuinely available to what's going on. And I think many of my favorite actors, sometimes what I feel I'm riveted by is my awareness of their presence and absorption of what's going on. Stillness, listening, whatever you want to call it. But also, if you're not listening with other actors, you're not really available to that unexpected thing. And so I think that's.

[00:04:03.710] - Speaker 2
I don't know if it's true in all things. I'm sure I've talked to Anthony about writing lyrics and coming in and performing them. Even for friends of 30, 40 years. You feel self conscious. There's, like, self consciousness in performance. And I think in acting, you fight self consciousness, or you have to try to cultivate space with other people where self consciousness recedes so that you feel that you're not standing outside yourself and watching yourself do something and reviewing it even as you're doing it. And I think that it's really interesting to me that I had an experience once with Robert De Niro, of all people, right? A person we all came up on know he's certainly in the short list of reasons I became an actor, right, or aspire to do a certain type of work or whatever. And the first film, I did a couple of films with him, but the first film I worked with him on, I also was one of the writers on the script. And that was in some ways a bad thing, because even though he was super complimentary of the work I had been doing, what it meant was that the first scene that I did with him in the film, which was a life ambition being realized.

[00:05:37.570] - Speaker 2
Like, I dreamed of working with him my whole young life. And it was there in front of me, and he was there. And I knew he was very supportive of me in my early career and all these things, I knew he had nothing but good feeling toward me in life. But as we began the very first scene I ever worked on with him, I got this adrenalized feeling that he wasn't happy with what I was doing. And I got into this real moment of feeling hugely self conscious. I went completely out. My analytic brain was just going, kapow, kapow, kapow. What's going on? What's going on here? He seems really out of sorts with me, or there's an energy coming, something. And we did it a few times. And then he kind of caught my eye and he looked at me and he gave me this look that was kind of like me going, yeah, seems like good. It was a real check in. It was like, kind of real brother.

[00:06:48.470] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:06:49.160] - Speaker 2
And I was like, wait a minute. And I walked around the corner, and I had. And this was like, I've made a lot of movies at this point. I wasn't new. I walked around the corner, and I had this total epiphany, which was I realized that I was interacting with a videotape in my head of what he was going to do in the scene because I had written it and because I had an idea of what Robert De Niro's performance was going to be like in the scene in my fantasy life, really, and in my writer's mind. And when, in fact, we were doing the scene and he was doing something else, I took it as a rebuke.

[00:07:29.450] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:07:29.900] - Speaker 2
My mind went, he's not showing up. He's resisting me. He's not doing this. Why? And in a funny way, it was funny because what I thought he was going to do was in a scene of conflict, like rise to meet me with a certain energy.

[00:07:42.080] - Speaker 3
Right.

[00:07:42.770] - Speaker 2
And when he didn't, I actually took it in as a negative from him.

[00:07:50.220] - Speaker 3
The character didn't take it in. Ed took it in.

[00:07:52.330] - Speaker 2
I took it is. I know this gets really down the weeds, but it was an amazing moment for me because at this point, I'm already a celebrated actor. Right.

[00:08:04.410] - Speaker 3
You're in a scene with Robert De Niro, so clearly you're a celebrated actor.

[00:08:08.080] - Speaker 2
And he'd asked me to be there, all these things. And I walked around the corner into the hall, and I had this great self conversation, and I said, you fucking idiot. You idiot. You've dreamed about this moment your entire life. He's there in front of you, and you're not even available to what he's doing. You're not even listening to the actuality of what he's doing. You're interacting with a videotape in your head. And in fact, what he was doing was brilliant, which is just like me. My character was trying to get a rise out of him, and his creative choice was, no. I short circuit this young guy coming in with all his energy by not giving an actual fuck. He's not going to rise out of me. And it was so brilliant. It was so much more true to, in a way, what a veteran person, a wiser person would do. And the thing was, it was having the intended effect on me. He was putting me on tilt, right?

[00:09:19.920] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[00:09:20.470] - Speaker 2
And when he gave me that look, I realized he's actually doing what he does so well. And I literally said, edward, just turn your brain off and be where you always wanted to be with him. And it was a great moment for me because I realized this never ends. It never ends. Your brain can mess you up badly and take you out of it, can take you out of that presence and in the moment so fast because of self consciousness, because of ego, really. At the end of the day, if I'm honest, it's just your ego flares and says, like, I'm being all kinds of things. Right?

[00:10:15.880] - Speaker 3
Was that the first time you were ever shook in a performance? Had it ever happened before where you just, based on what the other person was bringing, it took you out of yourself?

[00:10:28.090] - Speaker 2
I mean, I've certainly had. The thing I love about doing theater as opposed to working in film is like concert work versus studio work. It's a Zen act. It really is. Like, you dip your brush in the ink and you try to stroke that character, and when it's done, it's gone. That's what we did tonight. And it was a little more this or it was a little less that, and someone might do something. And when things are complex. I did a play years ago with Catherine Keener that was really hard. It's a wonderful play called burn this by Lanford Wilson. And there's a line in the play about writing, but about creativity. And he says, one character, know, you got to make it personal, make it true, and then write burn this on the COVID And I had it on the wall in my dressing room just because I thought, that's what we're doing every night. Every single night. We just got to burn it at the end. And you did, like, you do a play for months and months, and it was so hard. The whole thing was so hard. And it could careen around based on what you were feeling that night or whatever.

[00:11:40.460] - Speaker 2
That I think. I'm not sure I ever felt we figured it out until really, like, the very end, which is great. But I found doing that, that when you're doing live theater, I think you can get. I don't even say thrown off in a bad way. You can be completely buffeted by within the same text. You can end up in a totally different place. Sometimes someone can forget a line, they can drop a section, and suddenly your brain is going, in one way, it's going, what do we do now? What do we do now? Does it matter that we drop that piece of text? How do we catch back up? There's a lot of things can put you on tilt, but I had a really interesting experience once with, I think, one of the great, my favorite filmmakers, Alejandro Inyuridu, who makes these unbelievably poetic films. One time when we were doing Birdman, we were doing a scene that was really wonderful and hard, Michael Keaton and I, and we did it. And I think Michael Keaton and I looked at each other like, wow. That felt was. That was almost impossibly. And Alejandro came in and was just like, ripping his hair out.

[00:12:51.850] - Speaker 2
He goes, guys, I don't even remember what he said, but effectively he said, you just did white and I need black. That's how far off that's so funny you are. And Mike was a little thrown. And I thought, I love Alejandro so much. I think he's such a great artist. And he was one of those kinds of people that I thought, I'm here in service to him. I love the way in your book, you talked about things being the best things are a Diary entry, and why do you even care what other people think about your own? Like, Birdman was Alejandro's diary entry was every character was him, Keaton was him, I'm him. Emma Stone's character, the daughter is him. Everything being expressed in that film is a component of Alejandro's soul and character. And I think the whole film is a dialog with himself, about the different. Wrestling with his own ego and impulses and everything. And I knew going in, I am here to serve his diary. It's so good. I'm so interested in it. I'm interested in his process. And I was in the best possible place you can be, I think, as an actor with a director, which is complete surrender and complete trust.

[00:14:10.460] - Speaker 3
It's one of my favorite movies. It is, absolutely.

[00:14:13.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's a beautiful movie.

[00:14:14.580] - Speaker 3
Beautiful because it's a movie that made me. I remember when I saw it, I felt like, oh, this is a reason for there to be movies.

[00:14:21.550] - Speaker 2
Yes, I agree.

[00:14:22.280] - Speaker 3
That's how it made me feel.

[00:14:23.350] - Speaker 2
I agree also because it's a meditation. It's a meditation on aging, and it's a meditation on ego, and it's a meditation on aspiration to do work that matters in any way, in any field. And it's creating stakes, emotional stakes, out of people wrestling with themselves.

[00:14:49.630] - Speaker 3
Ordinary stuff, like the stuff that was happening was ordinary, but it comes up to this operatic level in the film.

[00:14:57.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I think one of the great, great, maybe the original film. And when I say that, I mean where I think a film that before it, there is no reference point for it is Fellini's eight and a half. That, I think, is kind of the first great modernist film in terms of being a meditation on self. It's a completely stream of consciousness, surreal meditation on creativity and ego and sex and love and everything. And I remember one time, I don't know Martin Scorsese super well at all. I've met him in passing a few times, but one time I ended up at a table and everybody else kind of got up, and I was just sitting there, and he said, hello. I said, hello. I said, I have a weird question for you. I said, what? What's before eight and a half? And he goes, nothing. Nothing.

[00:15:53.570] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:15:54.470] - Speaker 2
He goes, great question. Nothing. I think. That's right. You can tie Birdman to eight and a half, for sure. You can tie many other things. I think you can tie, like, if you take, like, fellini's Amicord also, which just really memory of youth. I can name six films that flow from Amicord. I can't really name that many before that that are that personal and structured just as memory of youth. I think he really was an amazing innovator in terms of thinking that the medium of film can just be meditation and image and self and all these. Not plot. But Alejandro's in that. He's that kind of a filmmaker. I think he tries to take in the totality of the world and how it's refracting through people, and it's never about plot. I think Birdman is really, really great. I think the one he did right before it called beautiful, I don't know if you've ever seen that one. It's in Spanish. It's such a masterpiece of emotional life. It absolutely destroyed me. And I think when he came in on us and said, whatever you're doing, I need the opposite. I felt Michael kind of bristled a little.

[00:17:12.810] - Speaker 2
I was in such a good place that I went. I started laughing, and I was like, that's the guy I want. If he says blue, I want to go blue.

[00:17:23.560] - Speaker 3
And what did it turn it. Do you remember what it turned into versus how it started?

[00:17:26.940] - Speaker 2
This is what was really funny. So it is really interesting thing, especially because that was quite a rehearsed film because of the technical necessities of doing these super long choreography fees and things like that. And so, like, okay, so wait, you're saying just throw out everything we're doing? Okay. So we started doing things that were just wildly different. And I thought, in a funny way, we got to some pretty interesting, maybe for me, not as was connected or whatever. But after a while, Alejandro came back in just equally frustrated with his wild hair. And he basically, in essence, he said, as though there had never been a previous thing, he was like, this is white, and I need know. He was basically saying, go back. Go back to black. But without an acknowledgement, he never went, you know what? Thank you. Thanks for that. It helped me see that I was wrong and that the other ones just. He was so caught up in it. He said, no, it has to be this. He walked away and Chivo Lubetsky, the cinematographer, who, they've been friends since college, I kind of just shot him this look just to see if.

[00:18:39.430] - Speaker 2
And he looked at me and he goes, he's not talking to you, he's talking to himself. And I was like, exactly right. And sometimes in the best relationships, and you've been in so many of them, I think, but in the best relationships, in creative work like that, that's allowed. Someone says, I need to know that you'll go 100% with me into an experiment without begrudging it and without telling why it's wrong. And so that I can know that you gave me the full force of what you've got. So if it doesn't work, I have confidence that it doesn't work because it doesn't work. Not because you wouldn't fucking try it with me, because you disagreed or because you. Whatever, right. And if you have that going on with people, anything can happen. You can get to that place where you go happily. No, I thought maybe that, but not. So you've sort of, like, tried it out and let it go. But people you've worked with so many bands, I don't know if you see that dynamic where people get defensive about it. I think one person wants to do something one person wants to do.

[00:19:56.920] - Speaker 2
So they're at loggerheads, right?

[00:19:58.540] - Speaker 3
All the time.

[00:19:59.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And sometimes it's sort of like, hey, look, we're here. What does it cost? Why be self protective or just try it? Yeah, what does it cost us? Right.

[00:20:09.840] - Speaker 3
Yeah. We always have to try it. The other thing is, when you're sharing an idea, I tell you my idea, you imagine something. What you're imagining and what I'm imagining often are nothing alike. Just because language is so imperfect and we all have wild imaginations, we can all hear the words of a song and imagine a very different story or from a poem. So when you actually do do the test and try it, then everyone, at least, is on the same page, because we just heard the same thing, so at least we're talking about the same thing. We're not arguing about a theoretical idea.

[00:20:48.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I was pretty moved watching that Beatles thing that Peter Jackson put together.

[00:20:57.250] - Speaker 3
Seeing the songs come out of nothing.

[00:20:59.280] - Speaker 2
Nothing was amazing. But it doesn't even matter what the cultural. The way that we take the stories of creative acts that we like, like the white album or let it be or whatever, like that. And then there's all this reductivism. It just happens. Legends get born and people say, yoko broke up the band, and this was going on, and that was going on, right. But you realize that apart from it just being silly, there's something sad about reducing complicated things that happen to stories of conflict, right? And I've had that happen. To me, people still say, like, this film became a fight. And it's like, no, it didn't. I did a film, american history x, that has really endured a lot of people. It was a strange process because the guy who directed it, Tony, was a very eccentric figure. I've met Tony very eccentric beautifully. So in many ways, there are many things that. And the truth is, our process on that was totally nontraditional but really vital. Really vital. And I didn't begrudge him his eccentricities at all. And actually, he was really appreciative to me. The things that went on, they were nuanced and complicated, and they had phases of, do we trust each other?

[00:22:32.210] - Speaker 2
Are we losing? You go through a process. And then he got into sort of this. He got into some things with the studio over wanting more time. And sometimes just practical exigencies come and you have to abandon the piece ultimately. Like, you have to finish it. And nobody's ever like, if something's good, maybe you're never done. And he didn't want to be done. And it came down to that.

[00:23:00.010] - Speaker 3
In retrospect, people love the film.

[00:23:01.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. And I think he does, and I do. Of course there's anything coming. You look at maybe that or this or that. You always hold that if you were inside it, right? There's no taking away from the fact of how that affected people. It still affects people. And when I look at it, I'm like, wow. A lot of what was being expressed not only didn't go away, it went away from the margins and became much more central in american life in scary ways. The rage that it was really about has bloomed. It hasn't gone more marginal. But the point was then you just get subjected to people saying, oh, there was a fight because it's salacious and it's good copy. Or whatever, and you go through that experience and you know that for whatever reason, sometimes people like to focus on the idea of conflict that went into creative things.

[00:24:02.030] - Speaker 3
Tell me about that project from the start. How did the project come to be that one?

[00:24:06.540] - Speaker 2
David McKenna wrote this edgy, weird story of a young skinhead getting sent to jail and trying to change his life. And I was really struck by it. David and I went and worked on it for months together. My argument to him was that it wasn't a milieu piece, it was actually Othello. Right. It really was that. If you think about, not to get too academic, but the greek idea of tragedy, which Shakespeare picked up and took on into kind of an extension, has in it this idea of the fatal flaw, that a person of enormous capabilities and beauty and potential brings themselves low through an excess of one characteristic. And I've always liked that. Even when I was a kid and I was learning about drama, I thought, that's such a neat idea that your strength, taken to excess, becomes your weakness. Your weakness isn't like a thing. It is actually your best quality, taken too far, can be the thing that actually hurts you or impedes you. It's an amazing idea. And I thought, I said to David, like, what if we approach this not as just sort of a punk rock film about skinheads and things?

[00:25:29.130] - Speaker 2
What if he's in that tradition of Othello and Macbeth and Oedipus, like, people who were on their way could have been great, and instead their story becomes a tragedy because something. And I said to David, I said, I think what's unsaid, but let's make it explicit, is that it's about rage. It's about anger. It's about this person brought low by the way that rage erodes his life. And once we hooked onto that, it got exciting to us because we felt like we can work in what for us, is kind of a punk rock way. We can shoot, like, down and dirty and in black and white and in Venice, and we weren't going to listen to white power music, but we had, like, fugazi's 13 songs in our head, and we had minor threat. There was a lot. I grew up on that. Like, when you talk about channeling, I felt like, that's the energy of this. That's the way we want to make it. It's the energy that's being expressed in it. And so for us, it was like, we can have a guerrilla attitude, but we can have a classical value in it, a dramatic ambition which elevates the whole heightens.

[00:26:45.210] - Speaker 2
Right.

[00:26:45.560] - Speaker 3
And it doesn't take away from the gritty.

[00:26:51.810] - Speaker 2
I mean, we made that movie for nothing.

[00:26:54.630] - Speaker 3
When did Tony get involved?

[00:26:56.300] - Speaker 2
So I can't really remember the studio. He hadn't made any films. He shot a lot of commercials. He was kind of a cutting edge commercial director, mostly. And when we all. David and Tony and I kind of bonded over it, it was funny. He and I, I think, actually agreed that we weren't sure that, you know, pull that off right. That was what really drew me to it. But I was thought, you know, you got to see. So Tony and I decided to do a test and I didn't bulk up yet, but I kind of looked at. I shaved my head and we put a lot of tattoos on and we shot this improvised kind of thing where a lot of what David and I put into some of the characters'speeches we made up and we shot it. And Tony and I looked at it together and we went, this is kind of working. This is pretty interesting. And so then we kind of all jumped know. He was really interesting because he's a great photographer. Maybe it's his greatest strengths. And you talk about availability. He's extremely available. He does not come at things with many preconceptions.

[00:28:08.410] - Speaker 2
He actually did a really funny thing that I really liked. One time we had a really great dinner. We were just talking the whole thing and it was very vital and we were excited about the whole thing. And I think he was very lit up and he grabbed his piece of paper and in kind of an artistic kind of way, he just wrote the date on a piece of paper and he stuck it out the window in the rain so that the. He wrote something like Tony and Edward this night, this date, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he stuck it out in the rain. So the rain hit the ink and then he took it and he was like, let's keep that. You know, what was like? And that's kind of who he really. He was very impressionistic and very stuff. And when we would work, he did all the lighting and he shot the movie. But he also operated the movie. He operated every. Really.

[00:29:01.130] - Speaker 3
It was a tiny crew and he did.

[00:29:03.150] - Speaker 2
But also a lot of times there was a great first ad on that film named Mark Catone, who was brilliant and really down for kind of the guerrilla way we were working. And a lot of times Tony would come on the set and just say to me, he would know directing actors wasn't his thing, particularly because he had never really done that staging anything. And he was often saying to me. Will you rehearse it? He knew David and I had basically worked on the script so he would have me kind of direct the actors and work with the actors and get the scenario set up. And he actually liked to be brought in only when he could sort of sit and watch something. And more often than not he would just go, it's so fucking brilliant. And then he would just start going light here, light there, real fast on my rig. Put the rig on my shoulder and let's rock. He would quickly do the mental math of, I'm going to do this and this and this and this and this. Let's rock. And we were often just rocking and rolling and going so fast.

[00:30:12.340] - Speaker 2
And he would literally fling one handheld thing with the mag off his shoulder as it ran out and have him drop another one on. It was almost like we never stopped. Wow. It was crazy. He shot like 2 millionft of film on this movie. It's crazy. But it was very vital and it was great. I mean, honestly, the whole experience. It was the way you want to work when you're that age and everything. And it took over a year, the editing of it, because Tony was nuts. I mean, he brought in a commercial editor and they cut a thing and the story wasn't there but the studio gave him a lot of time and we worked together and I actually went and brought. People said, I cut the movie. I didn't cut the. Like, tony went away. He went away to do a gig. He kind of actually took a break from the whole thing and we were left sort of sitting there going, what are we going to do? And I never cut the film. I kind of put an assembly of the raw materials together so that we could try to recruit. I think Tony agreed, as I remember, that maybe his commercial editor wasn't the guy to cut it.

[00:31:26.570] - Speaker 2
But we couldn't recruit somebody because we didn't really have a thing. So we put the whole thing together almost like just like a master. And out of that we got this guy named Jerry Greenberg who had cut the French Connection, apocalypse Now, Kramer versus Kramer legend. And Jerry Greenberg was the guy who really came in and really made it the film that it is. And the truth is it wound up like really positively. The stuff that everybody talked about being conflict later was kind of, in my opinion, looking way back on it. I think it was more than anything, Tony being anxious about the moment when you have to say, I'm finished. And he sort of spun out on the idea that it was complete and that it was done and started insisting on more time and kind of got into a little bit of almost a performance arty kind of mode in his fight with the studio. You know what I mean? And that's who Tony is, too. He is a bit of a performance. You know, his life and his conduct of life within art is kind of a piece unto itself.

[00:32:36.130] - Speaker 3
Yeah. He doesn't turn it off.

[00:32:38.610] - Speaker 2
That's right.

[00:32:39.490] - Speaker 3
Which, again, is a performance.

[00:32:41.730] - Speaker 2
And there's a point at which standing back from you can kind of go. Made him unique and kind of hilarious and great. It got to a place where it was starting to become a practical impediment to having something that was more than good enough. It was really working. And in a way, I always said to people that people were saying, like, why is he doing this? Are you in a fight with him? And I was like, I'm not in a fight with him at all. I ended up feeling sorrowful that he cut himself out from the pleasure of the result and not the credit. He directed film, but in a way, he cut himself off at the last minute from the ability to do that best thing. When you've come through the whole thing together and you all put your arms around each other's shoulders and put your heads together and go, we did this.

[00:33:42.630] - Speaker 3
Have you ever done it since?

[00:33:45.830] - Speaker 2
With him?

[00:33:46.540] - Speaker 3
Yeah. Have you ever had that head down moment? No hug?

[00:33:50.130] - Speaker 2
We did it. I've never run into him. It's really, really weird.

[00:33:53.040] - Speaker 3
I feel like today that would happen.

[00:33:54.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I've even heard secondhand that. I've heard from a distance that he acknowledges that in some ways that he. It's kind of what we were talking about, the way the brain can spin you up into a negative space. I think maybe he. Maybe he knows in a way that it's endured it. And by the way, that's the thing I like in your book, too. It's like you get a thing done. It's not yours the minute you're done. Number one is things move so far from what they were when you conceived them, it's very, very difficult to wrangle things into what was in your head. And they become what they become. And then all these unexpected things happen.

[00:34:37.130] - Speaker 3
They take on a life of their own. Yeah.

[00:34:38.670] - Speaker 2
And people form a relationship with them. They see things in them that you didn't intend. They relate to them. They misinterpret them. They interpret them in ways that are cool that you didn't intend. And in a way, for Tony, I think maybe now, maybe all this time later, he's able to see that? It's had a beautiful life. It's had a beautiful life. That everything in the intentional sense, which was to affect people, he achieved it in spades.

[00:35:07.010] - Speaker 3
And the film wouldn't be the film unless all of the things that happened.

[00:35:10.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but again, the whole process was right up there. At that time in my life, I was like, this is the way I want to work. This is the way I want to work. I want to work. I don't want to do John Grisham movies. I just didn't want to do that stuff. I was like, this is what I want to do. And then these are the kinds of things I want to say. And I was getting to the interesting thing about that one. Do you ever listen to things you worked on at a certain time and think, wow, it's so different than I thought it was at the time? You know what I mean? Like where you're older now and you look at a thing and you go, oh, I thought it worked because of x, but in fact, now I see it in a totally different light, or I hear it in a different way or whatever. On that one, I was with some people. Some people hadn't seen it. I was with Bradley Cooper and some other people, and he was exhorting these people to watch that film. So someone screened it, right?

[00:36:11.110] - Speaker 2
I hadn't watched it in I don't know how long, more years. I just did a thing, and I had a really interesting experience. It's powerful. But the thing that really struck me was that I thought when we made it, I thought I was a man. I thought I was expressing myself as a forceful adult person. You tell yourself, yeah, look, I got some muscles on me. I got the ink. It's powerful, it's iconic, it looks good. And I thought it worked back then. I thought it worked because I was doing something muscular and powerful, right? And when I watched it and actually teared up a few times watching it, I realized I was tearing up because it's about kids. It's not because I'm a man. And it's not working for the reasons I thought it was working. It's working because it's about really young people fucking themselves up around rage and sadness. And I was looking at it going, it works more because he thinks he's a man and then fails so horribly and in a way is barely growing up or is about to grow up when the consequences hit him. But I really thought, like, holy, you were the character.

[00:37:40.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but I really thought, like, look how, I mean, I was a kid you know what I mean? And that's kind of wild also to realize that you have a relationship with a thing, and it's not necessarily communicating in the way you think it's communicating. Maybe in some levels it is.

[00:38:00.460] - Speaker 3
I don't think we can know. I don't think we can ever really know.

[00:38:02.940] - Speaker 2
No. But in a funny way, it's like, I feel like all those things, the kind of headspace I was in. When you're in, your aspirations are so different. Hopefully they are. I think if your aspirations don't change as you get older, you're in big trouble. In a way, the aspirations, apart from ego and apart from wanting applause, wanting money, wanting whatever it is you think you're asserting any things, I also think. I think I was interested in wanting to. I wanted to assert an ability to channel things that weren't like me. You know what I mean?

[00:38:50.140] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[00:38:50.800] - Speaker 2
And in a weird way, over time I've gotten this place where I'm like, I don't say totally have lost my interest, but I've definitely lost my interest in violence. I was super interested in some of the things that I think young men get polluted by. And they gave me the chance to exercise certain kinds of muscles. And I was very uninterested in things that came close to my own vulnerabilities or experiences or whatever. I really wanted to incarnate things. I'm more and more interested in things that are closer to home. You know what I mean?

[00:39:27.460] - Speaker 3
There's an honesty in what's really happening.

[00:39:31.050] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And did you read barbarian days? Did you read that book? It's kind of a highly celebrated writer, New Yorker, who turned out had this whole young life was like just chase surf all over the world and surfed at a lot of the places like Tavarua and long before other people went there. And it's called a surfing life, but it's a meditation on getting older. I take it as like a look back at the way that when you're young, you're pushing yourself toward an aspirational idea of what you want to be, even though in many ways what you are is more present and unencumbered. And the older you get, as you get toward those aspirations, you actually are looking back, wanting to retain that unencumbered feeling of just being present. I relate to that. I relate to in always. The challenge in life is like recovering simplicity. It gets really hard to recover the state of mind, and it's gotten worse. I do agree with, like, if you read walt whitman's poem crossing Brooklyn Ferry, which I think is honestly one of the greatest pieces of american art ever, because it's so wild how he's saying in the poem, you, 200 years hence, I am thinking about you more than you can possibly know.

[00:41:09.560] - Speaker 2
And you're looking back to me, and I'm telling you that the dark days that fall on you, they fell on me. The horrors of fratricidal war, that was known to me. It's like such a wild thing, the way he is. Like everything you're going through. I went through it. The wharfs along the edge of the river in Manhattan. I walked there, too. I looked at the light on the water. And when I was living in New York young, I remember reading that and just, like, feeling like a time portal was. This guy opens a time portal and he's talking to you through it, and he has this stretch in that where he says, there never was any more age or beauty than there was now or ever will be. And sometimes I think that's true. Sometimes I think, obviously, like, the balances and the difficulty of achieving balance, that it's the same. It's the same in different forms in all ages. And people's existential challenges are the same. And in a way, that's what the dharma says, too. It's like you're in a state of anxiety that's rooted in your animal nature, your desires. You got to stand to the side of yourself and see that to be able to let go, right?

[00:42:35.170] - Speaker 2
But at the same time, it's also incontestible to me that we are succeeding in creating more noise and distraction around ourselves with every passing year. And I know there was things in the 70s when we were growing up, television and stuff, but these things in our hands now, the attention span, the assault on attention span and the assault on slow thinking quiet, it's just unreal. It's unreal. I'm shackled to it for a whole variety of reasons that are rationalizations. But you tell yourself, yeah, but I got my guitar tuner on it, right? You're like, yeah, I got a guitar tuner that goes on to the end thing, too. I don't need my fucking phone for that. And you say, like, but I like to check the tides, right? Or I like to do this, but then there's the crack cocaine on it that you just get sucked into, and you're just like, this is just noise.

[00:43:43.370] - Speaker 3
It doesn't make you feel good.

[00:43:44.760] - Speaker 2
No, it's just noise. And I'm sure our parents were worried about television in the way we're worried about social media, but I can't say I think those are entirely the same thing. I feel like the age of assault on your attention is the good news is I think people are talking about it. I don't, don't think we're unaware and it's happened fast and caught us, but I do think there's awareness and there's some communication going on. There's a lot of people who are discussing it.

[00:44:27.740] - Speaker 3
When did you get into surfing?

[00:44:30.460] - Speaker 2
I got into surfing later and I actually was working on a film in China and I had an accident doing a stunt and I broke my back. It sounds really dramatic. I cracked three vertebrae. Right.

[00:44:44.370] - Speaker 3
Do you normally do stunts?

[00:44:46.020] - Speaker 2
It depends. I mean, everybody does. There's some blurry line between what a level of that that you actually learn it. There's techniques, and it's fun to figure.

[00:44:59.540] - Speaker 3
Out plays into the character and it's.

[00:45:01.330] - Speaker 2
Fun to figure out the puzzle, even in filmmaking, especially to figure out how do you do that stuff and make it look great.

[00:45:11.070] - Speaker 3
What was the sun?

[00:45:11.870] - Speaker 2
Safely. But no, this was like a beautiful film about forgiveness called the painted veil.

[00:45:18.640] - Speaker 3
But how did you get hurt?

[00:45:20.440] - Speaker 2
Oh, I got chucked off a horse. A horse that I was on. Got know, just bucked me off and I landed funny. But my father was living in Indonesia then, and when the film was over, I went down there to hang out with him and recuperate.

[00:45:39.380] - Speaker 3
How did your dad come to live in Indonesia?

[00:45:41.520] - Speaker 2
He was doing conservation work. Yeah, he's a big conservation pioneer and environmental advocate and program builder. And he was working for a big conservation organization down there. And I met someone, introduced me to famous indonesian surfer Razal, a great guy. And it actually first appealed to me because it looked like it was the direction I wanted to stretch my back, you know what I mean? I needed to open my back up. I was really locked up. And also I was a sailor.

[00:46:20.460] - Speaker 3
When did you get sailing?

[00:46:21.770] - Speaker 2
When I was a kid. Yeah, I grew up near the Chesapeake bay and I learned to sail. And I loved the ocean. I love sailing and scuba diving and I had wind surfed and everything. I just had never surfed. So I started doing it like in my thirty s, and I just got completely addicted to it. I think it's like the thing that I've found that I can have a positive addictive relationship with. I never had a toxic addiction, although sugar and shit like that is definitely in the matrix for me. But it's just the kind of thing that I feel like surfing is like music. It's infinite you will never assess it or encompass it, because the movement of water and waveform is so infinite and so nuanced and so beautiful and so changeable that just like a musician, all you're trying to do is get yourself inside the pocket of that flow and have the ephemeral moment of getting in sync with that energy. And it doesn't matter how many times you do it, there's no guarantee you're going to get it right the next time. And every single place you go and do it, you can do it.

[00:47:50.460] - Speaker 2
We have the takuji is our friend, one of the great surfers and pied pipers of surfing and everything. And I know being when you're in the water with someone who's done it their entire life, they're still watching the water and the way it's moving toward them and doing all these micro reads, I mean, it's the ultimate in availability to the moment, because you have to perceive what is actually just taking place right now and get yourself in the sync with it, and it's good for you physically. It's great. Mentally. It's just completely, I mean, I have.

[00:48:30.380] - Speaker 3
To say, like, the antidote to the social media, it is. It's exact opposite.

[00:48:36.200] - Speaker 2
And I got to say, in a funny way, like, I love doing yoga. There's something about surfing that it might be, for me, it's like the most accelerated gateway to a clear mind.

[00:48:53.600] - Speaker 3
And presence.

[00:48:54.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah, presence. You do yoga to prepare to meditate, or you meditate and you focus on your breath, and you work toward emptying your mind, and then you hear your mind come in, and then it pings you back, and then you go, there it is again. Let me try to let it go again. There I am again. And all of it's great. Every single form of that kind of practice, literally, whether it's yoga or meditation or scuba diving or anything that gets you through into that state is great sometimes because of how noisy life is and the fact that I'll get into periods where I'm like, I cannot shut my brain off. It's just like I've electively chosen to take on a lot of stuff, and it's overstimulating my lists. It's not social media shit like that for me as much, although that will.

[00:49:54.040] - Speaker 3
Be this cheat fun projects things you're.

[00:49:57.620] - Speaker 2
But it's like the Radiohead song spinning plates. Sometimes you just go, what have I done to myself? What have I done to myself? Why have I done this? It's an embarrassment of riches, for sure. I know I'm lucky. I know that there's very little I'm doing in my life that I don't want to do for positive reasons other than taxes or whatever. You know what I mean? So it's an embarrassment of riches, and it's an uptown problem, for sure. Lucky problem to have to sort of electively take on a lot of things that are interesting and you're missing life across. Yes. That's what's so wild. It's so wild to realize that you've built pink Floyd's wall. No one else built it around you. You built it and you're trying to take the bricks off the wall. You get to a point in life and you're like, all I want to do is take bricks off this. And.

[00:50:56.180] - Speaker 3
But then you can imagine, but if I put this brick on top here, it's going to look so cool.

[00:51:01.320] - Speaker 2
And there's the compulsion to engage with things that are thrilling, vital, fun, people who are great. Sometimes it's like you can't help yourself. And then lo and behold, you're sitting there with your brain in a state of anxiety that the literal lists you've made, or the ones, or even worse, the brain bouncing around, worried that it's forgotten something on the list, right? Fight club has that great line. The things you end up owning you. That's definitely true in a material sense. But there's a non material version of that where the things that you've engaged in become this matrix of noisy mind that you can't. And you're like, where's my time to read? Where's my time to just listen to music or just be with no agenda or hang out with kids or walk in the beach, all of it. And then it becomes this thing of going, you got to get in the practice going, I can't do everything every day. I just can't. And so you got to put the balance. But it's funny, like, great literature or music, sometimes you think you knew what something was about when you were young. Then you read it again when you're older, like Marquez's books.

[00:52:32.800] - Speaker 2
But I do think the wall is really interesting, right? Because we loved it when we were kids. Because, hey, teacher, leave those kids alone. Or there was like these little. There's these things you grabbed in it, right? You grabbed what applied you at the time. I laid back and listened to that whole thing. One night I couldn't go to sleep, and I was like, fuck it. I have these good new headphones. I put it on and I listened to the wall like, all the way through, which I hadn't done in a long time, and I was like, wow, this is really about self imprisonment. It really is. This thing of, like, am I going to be able to deconstruct the thing I put around myself? And I had this whole different response to it. The thing is that you were saying, what's acting? And I'm saying, I feel pretty disconnected from it right now just because my last big personal diary entry was this film I wrote and directed, motherless Brooklyn. And it was completely satisfying to know you always care because people invest, know back you and whatever. But I really needed to just exercise it right.

[00:53:50.350] - Speaker 2
Like, I had worked on it, put it down for, like, eight years.

[00:53:53.780] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[00:53:54.470] - Speaker 2
I wrote half of it.

[00:53:55.670] - Speaker 3
Tell me the story from the beginning.

[00:53:58.480] - Speaker 2
Well, there's a book called Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Latham. Wonderful novel about a guy with Tourette's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder. It's a modern novel. It's a detective story from when the 90s, like the late, late 90s. But the pleasure of it wasn't the plot, it was the head, the journey inside the head of this character. And I related to it so intensively, like, really like the way in Joseph Conrad's heart of darkness, marlowe's looking at Kurtz and going, that I'm looking down into the void, and there he is, and I'm just on the edge of it. Mother's Brooklyn is funny and empathetic and warm, but I really was like. I really do feel sometimes if 20 synapses had been wired differently, I might be a really painful version of obsessive compulsive or touretic or whatever. I related so much to that aspect of it, that words triggering compulsive mental play with the words, phrases, rhythms, lines, sounds, and the need to repeat them and the need to twist them around and make a rhyme out of. I mean, it's just like I really related to it and then separately and kind of in parallel, I was really interested in this guy named Robert Moses, who, you know from growing know Robert Moses State park.

[00:55:29.990] - Speaker 2
Yeah. He's this towering figure in New York and american history who was very poorly understood until this great book called the Power Broker was written about him. And in many ways, you could argue that he was the Darth Vader of american life in the 20th century. He was like Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi, like a person of incredible capabilities who went to the dark side, actually went over to the dark side and did incredible damage to the social fabric of New York. Based on racism and based on power and based on all these things. And people thought he was the parks commissioner, and I was fascinated by him, and I was fascinated by the idea of the way that injustices become systemic. They get baked into the actual way our society is built. But he seemed esoteric in a way, the kind of thing that you could tell yourself, the lie that you could make a movie like a citizen Kane about him, and you could say, yeah, I'm going to make citizen Kane. But in the back of my mind, I knew you needed a vehicle for looking at him. So I had this wild idea to use the touretic detective as the vehicle for looking at what happened.

[00:57:01.180] - Speaker 2
But I had to go, great idea. Yeah, I had to go to Jonathan, who wrote motherless Brooklyn, and I said to him, I got the craziest idea. And I said, but I can't do this without your permission, honestly. I said, I want to take your character, but I want to like Philip Marlowe, or I want to take your detective, and I want to send him off into another adventure. I still want to explore the idea that his boss and the only person who understood him is murdered. But I want what he unspools, the thread that he pulls on. I want it to be a vector for looking at what Robert Moses did to New York. It's the coolest idea in the. Thank God. He said, hey, I wrote my book. I don't need you to rewrite my book. And he said, I love films. Many of the best adaptations or springboards into something.

[00:57:57.730] - Speaker 3
Did you always know you wanted to call it motherless Brooklyn?

[00:58:00.290] - Speaker 2
Such a great title.

[00:58:01.260] - Speaker 3
I see.

[00:58:02.080] - Speaker 2
Such a great title.

[00:58:03.180] - Speaker 3
I see.

[00:58:03.920] - Speaker 2
But the other thing is, he didn't write motherless Brooklyn about Robert Moses and what happened in the bifurcating of the my. But motherless Brooklyn is such a great. That's what happened to the city.

[00:58:22.580] - Speaker 3
Yes.

[00:58:23.350] - Speaker 2
No one was looking out for know. And all these places that we know, these places that were communities, the african american communities in Brooklyn and the jewish communities in the Bronx, and they ravaged them, they chased people out. They did unbelievably scuzzy and destructive things and purposely put highways through the middle of portions of them. There was a lot about the way that they remade New York from the 19th century city into the 20th century city that was purposely and cruelly and unnecessarily destructive, including even things that sound apocryphal, but that were true. Robert Moses dreamed up many of the parks and the parkways and things like Jones beach. He also intentionally had the overpasses set at a height that busses would not be able to go under them so that minorities couldn't go to Jones beach. Wow. Yeah. And that's true. He really did that, really, really tried to make sure that public transportation would keep minorities from his new public beaches. And I love the idea of motherless people, but of whole communities that no one's looking out for. Thankfully, Jonathan not only gave me his blessing, he was like, I'm fascinated. He's like, I love this idea.

[00:59:42.320] - Speaker 2
And he let me do this wild transposition of his character into a totally different story. When I moved to New York, when I was in my early twenty s, I worked in housing, I worked in affordable housing finance, and I used to go around in all these neighborhoods and everything, so it connected to a lot for me and I really wanted to get it done. But when I went to write my own mystery, my own Chinatown, I got really hung up. I got really hung up in the jigsaw puzzle of it. And then because I was lucky and I had gigs coming at me, and I was like, I'm going to put it down and I'll do this gig. And I lost it. I lost the thread, I lost the momentum. I lost the impetus. And it kind of was, like, there, and it haunted me for like ten years.

[01:00:35.760] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[01:00:36.270] - Speaker 2
And I kept saying, yeah, I'm going to pick it back up. And finally a friend at a studio, he stuck a fork in me, was like, maybe I should give this to someone else. Maybe I should let someone else have the right to. You can still play the role or whatever. It kind of like, smacked me in the face in a good way. And I was like, what are you going to do? What's going to satisfy you more than finishing this? Nothing. And if you don't, it's going to be an actual regret. Like an actual regret, not like a passing thing. You're going to regret it if you don't see this through. So I finally picked it back up and I bounced it around with the writer friend. And it was really weird. It was like the thing I'd been so hung up on, it unlocked like that. And it wasn't just like in my sleep. I came up with it. Enough time had gone by, and something that seemed illogical to me just suddenly didn't anymore. It just unlocked. And then I did it really fast. I did it in a big salvo of a whole bunch of nights of just staying up all night, sleeping in the day, writing all night, sleeping in the day, and I finally got it done.

[01:01:52.750] - Speaker 2
And then it took me a while to figure out how to get it made.

[01:02:02.200] - Speaker 3
How hard is it to get a movie made?

[01:02:04.270] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't know if you feel this is true in music, too, but we're in a golden era for storytelling. Narrative storytelling is in a golden era. Now. It might not be the form we grew up with, where you went to the cinema all the time and everything, but what's happened in terms of streaming platforms and all the business of it all, you can gripe about the change in the form and the change in the way it's delivered and where people are seeing what they're seeing and all of it, and it's true. But at the same time, what effectively has happened is that people have set up these blast furnaces and they need know. There was a series that I love called I may destroy you. I don't know if you ever saw that. This british ghanaian woman, Michaela Cole, wrote, directed and stars in this. It's so good. It's so brilliant. And to me, it's an example of, like, there is so much more diversity of storytelling now. So many different voices are finding their way. The forms have been exploded. It's not all 2 hours and 20 minutes. It's like multipart and three part and ten part and multiseasons and big long films.

[01:03:21.510] - Speaker 2
And I think it's almost indisputable that if there are more doors to knock on, more forms, more ways and more types of storytellers getting to do their stuff than ever, all the things people are saying about making, democratizing it more, all true, all great, it should be pushed and pushed and pushed, but I don't think anybody can contend with the fact that there are more ways to get things done today than there ever have been. And that's cool. I think that's cool. I think certain types of things aren't getting made as theatrical films as much anymore. But you got to decide at a certain point if you care. I got a lot of vinyl records. I still like to put them on, but I can't pretend that I also don't love moving around in the world with the entirety of all music that's ever been made available to me. I love know. I love it. I love being able to flea turn me on to, like, pharaoh Sanders, that last record or whatever, and it's like floating points. Yeah. Where would I find to be able to get tipped off to something and then settle in with it?

[01:04:43.710] - Speaker 2
And so great. So great. I love the availability of that. It's great.

[01:04:51.870] - Speaker 3
When's the last time you went to the cinema to see a movie?

[01:04:55.840] - Speaker 2
I saw some things in the last couple of weeks. It sounds fancy, but a friend with a screening room put some things. I love seeing things on big screen. I love it. No matter how big your home tv is, it's not quite the same as watching it in a room with other people. I love is. It's funny because I wanted to ask you a question. It flows up and out of what we're talking about, which is like, after I did motherless Brooklyn, I felt satiated in a way, like, exhausted. But I got to fully exercise. I got to fully realize the thing that had been in my head for a long time. That was great. It was great. As an actor, I really loved and related to the character. I got to express something. I got to write it, I got to direct it. I had great, great, great actors that I absolutely adored in it. And one of the biggest unexpected things was that I got to produce all this music in it, right, great. Tom York wrote a new track for me. He played it for me in a demo. And I got to go to Oxford and work with him on that.

[01:06:11.160] - Speaker 2
This brilliant composer, Daniel Pemberton. We worked night after night after night on the music together and recorded it in Abbey Road and in air studios, George Martin's other place. And Wynton Marcellus and his band created the music for a jazz band in a jazz club that's like Miles Davis's quintet. So I got to work with Wynton on recording, re recording a Mingus piece and a Clifford Brown piece. And then Wynton and his quintet played the sort of new ballad standards that Daniel wrote and we recorded. So I got to make music in Abbey Road in New York with Wynton, in Oxford with Tom. And I got to really actually produce all that and cut it and weave it in a thing. And I've directed other films, but it was like an exalted experience for me, getting to work with those people absolutely on that kind of music and to shape the music I play. But it was like I got to slip into a world that you guys work in all the time and do it in a way that was such a. It was so gratifying. Like, I never wanted it to end. It was so much fun.

[01:07:34.020] - Speaker 2
And then I finished it and then Covid hit, which was fine with me creatively, I was looking for a big sabbatical for my mind and everything anyway. And I've done one or two things, but I really almost just gave myself a permission to just stop and almost go through, like a junkie. Like the brain.

[01:08:04.800] - Speaker 3
What am I supposed to be doing?

[01:08:06.290] - Speaker 2
What am I doing? Or, I got to work. What am I doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? There's the voice, like, screaming in your head, like, you're crazy not to gig, or, you're crazy not to work. And I almost had to let that fade a little to even get around to a point of going. It feels distant. Super distant. And that feels good. Fine. Like, really, really good and fine. And the last year or two, I've actually had to repeatedly kind of meditate, talk to myself and just go do an exercise of, like, imagining I'm on my deathbed and I'm looking back and knowing that I want a tapestry. I don't want the repetitive experience of playing dress up and make believe at infinitum. Like, I want to do other things. I want to just experience other things. And then I actually read this essay that Vaslav Havill wrote. The guy who was the playwright who became the president of Czechoslovakia. Incredible figure. And he wrote this essay called Second Wind. And he basically said that in a creative life, you do this wave of work and you exhaust it. And then you have two choices.

[01:09:35.640] - Speaker 2
You can start to repeat that work in one form or another. You can essentially keep revisiting the same ideas. Or you can stop and refill yourself with life and be willing to start again.

[01:09:54.030] - Speaker 3
A whole new adventure.

[01:09:55.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I love that. It's scary. It's definitely scary. It definitely has given me some moments of all the brain wobbles, insecurity. Is anybody going to let you back in and do it? Are you going to know how to do it? And that's why I was saying at the very beginning, I'm getting damn close to this place where I'm like, I'm.

[01:10:21.980] - Speaker 3
Not sure you know how to do it.

[01:10:24.300] - Speaker 2
That I know how to do it.

[01:10:25.160] - Speaker 3
That's great.

[01:10:25.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that's good. Because I think I'm not physically the same person anymore. I don't look the same. And there's a part of me that thinks that that's even good within what acting is at its best. It's like, I do have that thing where I'm like, I've seen these people too much. I can't let go. Or there's some of my favorite actors who I think have you kind of forget about them. And then it's like, whoa. But that's hard to do if you're working relentlessly. But the thing I was going to ask you is, when I pulled up, I was playing the chili Peppers track, white braids and pillow chairs. From that, I guess not you guys did another one, but from the unlimited thing, I think it's one of the best things they've ever done. And in particular, I think the back half of the second record, which isn't the stuff that makes the radio, and it's not even what they've been playing out in tourism, I've seen everything. But, like those tracks, like, it's only natural. And white braids and pillow chairs and she's a lover and let them cry. They're in such a fucking groove in that I went down on that like a kid with the first.

[01:11:55.380] - Speaker 2
I was listening to it over and over and over again. And I've been friends with those guys a long, long time. I think they're playing at a level of musicianship. And I think Anthony wrote some. That song when I was playing, I think it's like one of the best songs he's ever written. It's just unbelievable. Like, there's just not a lot of people who have been making music together for over 30 years who still, in my opinion, find that it's just great. But I have this kind of theory that in part it's because John stops.

[01:12:25.060] - Speaker 3
I think so too.

[01:12:26.580] - Speaker 2
It's crazy to think about, but it's relevant to this conversation, to me. Not because you've worked with them or anything, but because to me, in the culture that we're in, if you say out loud, you say like, oh, the first time John went out of that band for health reasons and everything. Right. Came back in. But they do that whole run of great records that you guys did, like Californication and by the way, and stadium arcademy and these things. But between that and now, that's like over 16 years. It's like 16 or 17 years between that and John playing with them again. And in our culture and in our minds, even if you say the sentences out loud of like, who would quit playing with the chili peppers or who would give that up, right. Most people would reflexively go, no way. Right. And yet, to me, I really feel like if they didn't, it wouldn't be the same. I don't think you could.

[01:13:32.870] - Speaker 3
There's definitely a feeling of everyone has a tremendous amount of gratitude that they have it now.

[01:13:42.110] - Speaker 2
Right.

[01:13:42.760] - Speaker 3
And that might not have been the case if you had it all the time.

[01:13:45.750] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:13:46.430] - Speaker 3
You know, when something is gone and comes back, it's that much sweeter.

[01:13:51.340] - Speaker 2
Yeah. You treat it precious, but it's.

[01:13:53.820] - Speaker 3
You don't take it for granted.

[01:13:55.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it's funny, they play like them. But I also have to say to me, I don't know if you've musically, developmentally, they're playing like jazz musicians on that record. They're playing like they're the best musicians. He's playing.

[01:14:14.240] - Speaker 3
They're the best musicians. And Anthony, from the beginning till now has just continually gotten better and better and better.

[01:14:20.890] - Speaker 2
It's funny I asked Anthony, I wrote Anthony about that song white braids, which you're never going to hear on the radio, right.

[01:14:27.240] - Speaker 3
It's one of my favorite songs on the album.

[01:14:28.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's a gorgeous piece of writing. And John's not even playing. I mean, John's playing this beautiful Les Paul like rhythm fill. You know what these. I mean, I sat there trying to work those chords out because it's just this gorgeous. And I asked and I was like, I wrote him. I said, I think that's like one of the best songs you've ever written. And he said, you know what's really weird is he said, I saw the scene of that. I saw those two people in a cafe like 20 years ago and I wrote it down. He said, I've been sitting the image of this couple amazing, which I love too, because I think like the. I can't remember what it's in one of Rilka's, the austrian poets letters. He says he had that said, like, to a real artist, ten years is nothing. Gestation is everything. I think about that a lot. I think like. But it's something that I really admire about. I don't even know John as well as I know flea and. But I really admire that. The courage to live a life and take a break from an know. It's really, really hard to do.

[01:15:49.890] - Speaker 3
Absolutely.

[01:15:50.540] - Speaker 1
Let's listen to that song Sama Tiger and I wanna rip it off to shred so I ask it why she's a loaded cobra bench you wanted to be with me for the ride.

[01:16:29.820] - Speaker 2
In.

[01:16:30.160] - Speaker 1
A Sunday diner I'm reminded there's no finer place to kiss than one like this but babe I can see what's right with you why prison pillow place? I could spend my night with you this pussy will obey I can see outside of you why praise and pillow chair I don't know what I would do without your pillow she's a bobbit Darren singing to the fish and heaven sacrifice all that tonight there's a common gear pop that back in we believe it is a lie.

[01:17:32.240] - Speaker 3
You can see.

[01:17:33.040] - Speaker 1
The river running through my devastated concrete eyes they don't deny but, babe, I can see what's right with you while praising pillow train I could spend my night with you this pussy will open I can see outside of you I pray I don't know what I would do California, California sing to you deep into the sky rolling mine rolling wide deep into us eyes rolling by Santa Obey safe to say take away safe and just obey.

[01:19:33.540] - Speaker 2
So nice. Yeah. It's such a romantic song. There's like so much longing in it and dreaming of connection, you know? It's just. It's just a great. It's a beauty. I really love it. But it's funny. In your book, I like the idea you had that people are making themselves antennas and conducting things down. They could come through different people, but they come through. It's really weird. I play guitar. Not great, but I love guitar. I really love the instrument. And I'm in music, and I love lots of bands. And you identify or you relate to things. But there's such a funny thing. To me, John is like one of the all time for me, John sits in this really specific, like, Hendrix and Prince and John. For me, they play the same way. There's a lightness of touch, there's a flickeriness to it, but it's really wild. The best way I can put it is when I'm listening to this record, like I was listening to. It's only natural. When I'm coming out here, sometimes the path of the notes that a certain person finds land in you. And they're right. They're just right. There's lots of people I listen to, and I'm like, they're great.

[01:21:09.630] - Speaker 2
That's great, whatever. I can't explain the level of satisfaction my brain gets out of where John puts notes. To me, they're like, perfect. And I kind of get that sensation you're talking about in the book where I'm just like, why am I. Other people might not feel that. And it relates to the Mellows Brooklyn thing. I get really thrown off if I feel like a note or a syncopation or something lands in the wrong way. You know what I mean? A rhyme or a thing. I think that is such a strange aspect of the brain that something in you is saying, like, it's not language, it's not logic, it's not anything. But your brain is saying, that's in the right place. Why?

[01:22:02.600] - Speaker 3
Yeah, we don't know why, but you really can feel it. And I think that's the key to all music I've recently come to this. It really is just the timing, the little timing between the notes. That's where all the energy lies. The juxtaposition, the space, the way these.

[01:22:23.440] - Speaker 2
Guys are laying this. It's also the way people lay space over each other. Someone makes space and someone else.

[01:22:29.280] - Speaker 3
Someone's pitching, someone's pulling.

[01:22:31.380] - Speaker 2
Right. And on this group of tracks that I like, one of the things I love so much is it's like this inversion, because John's flea is playing a lot of melodic complexity around spaces John's making with some very simple rhythmic things. There's a big inversion going on of a lot of what you associate with, like, bass and know. But I just find the whole way that I have to be honest, the older I get, the more I envy music as a form of expression. I like the things that I've gotten to work on.

[01:23:11.260] - Speaker 3
I think also maybe because it's not work for you, do you know what I mean? Like the fact that it isn't work.

[01:23:16.710] - Speaker 2
It's true.

[01:23:17.470] - Speaker 3
You get to enjoy it in a different way.

[01:23:19.490] - Speaker 2
Yes. And look, I know musicians spend an enormous amount of time on the math to get to the place where it becomes not math. Right? Because there's mathematics in music, there's patterns. And musicians can get very analytic and wonky also to create a thing that helps the rest of us get out into the know, the rhythm and vibration stuff. But there is something really enviable, too, about the autonomy that's in music. Like, I feel this with, like, Tom and Johnny and these guys I stopped in to see. Tom and Johnny were in the studio at Abbey Road late, and I went in and I was just watching them. I was like, these guys have been just like Flea and Anthony. They've been good since high school, and they're still sitting on the floor, on the parquet floor in studio two in Abbey Road, just playing, figuring, playing, literally figuring shit out. And they don't have to get anybody's permission to do it. They don't have to get anybody's money to do it. They don't have to ask anybody to do anything. They can just go and do it. And there's a cataclysmic gulf between that freedom and the form that I've worked in.

[01:24:38.170] - Speaker 2
More where the amount of headache. I mean, I love that I can sit down and write a thing, right? And if it ended there, that'd be great. But the lack of autonomy, not just as an actor, like film in general.

[01:24:54.000] - Speaker 3
The number of people involved, it's such a big production.

[01:25:00.640] - Speaker 2
It's an assault on your desire to have that kind of sacred space. Right. It doesn't facilitate, and in some cases, it doesn't even permit the creation of a sacred space. And I find that really enviable. And the longer I'm friends with people, we've been friends a long time. He's a monk. I envy the purity. I really envy the purity of the fact that a lot of times I pop across to his house and he's in the middle of a bass lesson. A bass lesson. He still takes lessons with his jazz teacher, and he's practicing and know those guys have a devotional relationship. Tom expresses this, too, that he can't think of it as content if he doesn't have a devotional relationship with know. And it keeps him in life. It's very hard to have. I'm going to be honest, it's hard to have a devotional relationship, to keep a spiritual space in work that is as crowded as making films is.

[01:26:14.900] - Speaker 3
But I love the idea of that as that a problem to solve.

[01:26:21.580] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:26:21.980] - Speaker 3
It hasn't been that way, but maybe there is a version of that, and it could be really interesting. Maybe you can basically put together, essentially, a small theater group and film everything you do and have it be. And it could turn into some. There's some.

[01:26:40.390] - Speaker 1
You can get there.

[01:26:41.120] - Speaker 2
You can get.

[01:26:41.460] - Speaker 3
Yeah, there's a way to do it.

[01:26:43.140] - Speaker 2
There's a way to do it that approaches it. Bernamand's damn close. That was, like, right up there with, for me.

[01:26:51.780] - Speaker 3
How quickly was that shot?

[01:26:53.340] - Speaker 2
Very quick. Like, I think 28 days or something like that. Lots of rehearsal. Yeah. Which was wonderful. And I'm not saying that Francis Coppola's line, I love, like he said, the best things about making movies is that they're collaborative. And the worst thing is that they're collaborative. It's really true. And I think it's also unfortunately true that the Hitchcock line that directing a film, he said directing a film is to be pecked death by a thousand pigeons. So true. Right? It's just like the questions never end, and the left brain assault on the right brain is the intrinsic challenge in making movies. And there's just so much artifice. It's also unfortunately, and maybe this is why Alejandro wanted to do. When I read Birdman, he didn't originally say, I'm going to try to create the single shot experience. Right. I think whether he knew it or not, what he was trying to do was come as close to flow state in a filmmaking process as you can. And I know, look, you guys are craftsmen. You're stitching together a lot. I know. It isn't pure flow state, it's not live. It's a lot of craft.

[01:28:09.620] - Speaker 2
It's a combination and a lot of stitch work. Right? A lot of stitch work. And yet, if you guys do a take and you're seeing a take, you're trying to find those things where the flow of the notes arrives at the right place.

[01:28:25.870] - Speaker 3
Right.

[01:28:26.880] - Speaker 2
And when I talk about it, that's not dissimilar from doing takes on a film similar.

[01:28:31.990] - Speaker 3
It's like when it just locks in.

[01:28:33.640] - Speaker 2
And comes together and you say, that was the one.

[01:28:36.170] - Speaker 3
That's the one, yeah, same. And then you still might do something else to it after it's true.

[01:28:42.590] - Speaker 2
Even as we're talking about it, I.

[01:28:44.950] - Speaker 3
Mean, think about it, just putting the score in changes.

[01:28:46.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Oh, hugely, hugely. I'm never ceased to be amazed by not just what music, but sound mix in general. Most films just don't work at all until the sound mix is done. It's not even fairy dust. It's literally like a piece of furniture that's gouged and you can see the bolts and the cracks and everything. And until the sound mix is done, it's like shellac that goes over the whole thing and suddenly it looks beautiful and it works and there's this whole sleight of hand. I can't even explain it, but it suddenly makes the whole thing cohere. I mean, I've been right up against the edge of going, oh, my God, this doesn't work at all. And when you do the sound mix, it suddenly it's like, oh, my God, it works like gangbusters. It's wild how much the auditory experience of it can change the story you.

[01:29:47.760] - Speaker 3
Told about the De Niro scene and being taken out of the moment by what he was doing reminds me very much of the scene in Birdman where you're meeting Michael Keaton's character on the stage and he's got all these ideas of how the performance is supposed to be. And you start, your performance is so good that he doesn't even understand that it has started. He thinks you're still talking to him when you're doing the scene. It was just like that, and he didn't even know what to do with it. It was a great moment.

[01:30:24.790] - Speaker 2
Yeah. There's a lot in that that's multi layered and fun. Amazingly, that is the scene I was talking about where Alejandro said, you guys are doing it, like, all wrong.

[01:30:39.120] - Speaker 3
It's amazing.

[01:30:40.110] - Speaker 2
I'm not sure that what's in there isn't the very first one of those early ones. If it isn't, it's the one. We went away from it and came back to it.

[01:30:49.430] - Speaker 3
It's very disarming watching that scene because we all have the same effect as Michael Keaton. We're experiencing Michael Keaton, the viewers. And when we come to realize it's already started, it's like, oh, this is what it's really.

[01:31:06.580] - Speaker 2
It's.

[01:31:07.000] - Speaker 3
This is when it's good.

[01:31:08.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly.

[01:31:08.940] - Speaker 3
It's like you don't even know it when it's good.

[01:31:11.960] - Speaker 2
I just think that, and maybe it's familiarity breeds contempt or you're always looking across whatever grass is greener. There's something in me, though, that some of it's the autonomy. I've always envied musicians and their autonomy to do their work in a room together and no one can. They don't need permission from anybody. Right. It's harder to make films that way. Maybe I'm rationalizing it. I should be able to take my iPhone and go out and do whatever I want. Right? But it's the way of the world. But I think what everybody's really chasing on some level is a feeling of flow state, you know, surfing, music, hanging, whatever, and maybe two. It's because I like going and hearing live music so much. And when I see live music, where you just go, what could be better than that? What could be better than to be. To have the facility with an instrument or your voice, to be able to be having it flow through you and working it out as you're going. To me, it's just incredibly enviable. But I guess you've done it so long, it's not like you can romanticize that. It isn't a struggle.

[01:32:32.960] - Speaker 3
No.

[01:32:33.300] - Speaker 2
But people get in and they.

[01:32:34.830] - Speaker 3
When it happens, when something magical happens and it happens often, it's still shocking every time. You can't believe it when it's happening. When we were up in that other building and John Pashanti started playing guitar, first time I went back to see a rehearsal after John rejoined the band, I just started crying when they were playing together because it was such an emotional thing to see. It's so tightly knit between them where it's like the psychic connection is so deep, they move like they're one, like half of an octopus. They just work together perfectly together. And then when they're doing a take live now, I've heard the song in rehearsal many times, and then there's a dramatic thing that happens in one of the songs, or in all of the songs often, and something happens where you can't believe you're in the room while this is happening. It's almost like they can't believe it's happening or that they're not even there. They're so there that they're not there, and it's remarkable. I had that experience also with Carlos Santana. When he starts playing, it's like it's coming from somewhere else. It's some other thing I don't know how to explain.

[01:34:08.160] - Speaker 2
I mean, I think Tom York told me that there's a track I love of theirs called. It's like it has that line, just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there. And I think Tom told me that when he listened to it back, he started to cry, even though they were pretty far along in their career at that point, that he really, like, it went beyond him. You know what I mean? Yeah. And that he was made emotional by it. It's funny because Anthony, he's such a funk master, and he writes these things, but I kind of think of my friends who are songwriters. The thing I'm really knocked out by a. He's like a surrealist. I mean, he really is like a linguistic surrealist. And it's that same part of me that relates to the touretic thing in motherless Brooklyn. The wordplay, the impulse. If anybody plays with words, who. Who writes in a way that's wordplay more than Anthony. He stitches things together. He puts rhymes and concepts together that if you look at them, they don't make any sense at all. Like, literally, you could write it. And I always know what it's getting at.

[01:35:31.880] - Speaker 3
Yeah, it paints a picture.

[01:35:33.380] - Speaker 2
It's so wild, though. What is that line? There's a Carmen Gia parked out back, and we believe it's alive. Why am I moved by that? That's really wild. You know what I mean? That hits me in the heart, because it's words that don't make sense, but you know that it's about a guy wanting to get in a car with a girl and drive. You know what I mean? And that's amazing to me. I love how oblique the ability to just put words together that are funky and that rhyme and everything, but that don't make literal sense and have so much. That are feeling so oblique and have that much longing or juice mojo, whatever the vibe of the song, it's a pretty wild thing to be that non literal and always be able to communicate an emotional sensibility. It's like those things where. Have you ever seen those things where they'll take a paragraph and every single word of the paragraph, they jumble the letters, but you look at the paragraph and you can read it out loud perfectly. It's something like that. It's like you don't need the logic of it to get the essence of it.

[01:36:57.190] - Speaker 3
That's another advantage, I think, that music has over images, is the image shows you so much that it's hard to imagine your own version because you're looking at a version. Whereas if you're listening to a story, what you picture and I picture will picture different versions of that story, but if we see the picture, we're looking at the same picture.

[01:37:24.550] - Speaker 2
Yeah. In a way, it's why there have been some great music videos. But on the other hand, yeah, it.

[01:37:31.620] - Speaker 3
Can be just as limiting.

[01:37:32.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I don't have a lot of use for a lot of them.

[01:37:37.060] - Speaker 3
Tell me, the craft of learning to act, what was that for you? When did it start? How did it work?

[01:37:47.380] - Speaker 2
My parents used to like to go to plays, and I think I had a babysitter who was in a play, and I saw a play when I was like, five, and the whole thing seemed very magical to me. And it wasn't movies at first. I don't remember watching movies as a small kid, but I saw plays and I immediately wanted to be in that. I don't think it was more articulate than that. I wanted to be a part of it. And I started taking acting classes at a little community theatrical arts school. Not at my school or anything, just this great little community.

[01:38:29.480] - Speaker 3
How old were you at the time?

[01:38:30.730] - Speaker 2
Five.

[01:38:31.620] - Speaker 3
Then?

[01:38:32.280] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:38:32.770] - Speaker 3
You started taking lessons at five?

[01:38:34.930] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:38:35.410] - Speaker 3
It's amazing.

[01:38:36.580] - Speaker 2
But I played piano, too, and I did soccer and I did. It was not like, understood. This is what I'm going to do at all. It was pure play. Just play. I just thought it was fun. I bounced around doing my jumbled little life. It wasn't like a calling at that point. But I will say there was a lady who created our little community theatrical arts school who was completely legit. And I mean, at the, like Stella Adler, Lee Strasberg, that level of seriousness, of intent to communicate what this is and that you take it seriously and that you got to learn the craft of it.

[01:39:38.440] - Speaker 3
Incredibly lucky that that.

[01:39:40.250] - Speaker 2
Incredibly. It's really interesting, too. This is like, in suburban Columbia, Maryland, like central, right? This lady, she came out of New York, moved with her husband, and she built a community theater arts program in a little nowheresville in central Maryland that lots of people flowered up and out of into Broadway careers.

[01:40:10.020] - Speaker 3
So cool.

[01:40:11.190] - Speaker 2
And that my recollection of it was when you say a studio, it was a studio. It was a place that the kids who were there were like, if you're here, you come correct. It's real, it's real, it's wild.

[01:40:31.920] - Speaker 3
And then after that, when did you reengage with it?

[01:40:35.130] - Speaker 2
I think a measure of seriousness about it notched up when I was, like, 16 or 17, and my public school just went, for whatever reason, went down and went to the National Theater in DC. And Ian McKellen was doing this one man show, which, when I think back on it, I'm like, why would they take a bunch of public school kids from outside Baltimore to see Ian McKellen in a one man show about acting? Shakespeare, that's what it was called. And it was kind of about his life in theater. In a way. It could have been right at home in this conversation. It was him kind of meditating on creative life and how, in his case, Shakespeare's texts had opened up the gateway for him into sound like a great show. Life. It was. What it was for me was, you're a teenager and you're fantasizing a different. At least I was kind of like, it'd be great to be a pro baseball player. Oh, it'd be great to be a spy. Oh, it'd be great to be whatever he made it seem like, oh, that's a life. That's something you could actually do. It's not like, oh, there are people who are in movies, but I'm here.

[01:41:58.440] - Speaker 2
It was like, no, this is a door and you can walk through it. And I definitely remember my wheels turning after seeing it and going, this is in the realm of the possible and maybe something I should not let slip out of the mix. You know what I mean? But then when I went to college and I studied theater some, but I can't explain it. Part of it was I just didn't know who I was. I thought I wanted to study physics, then I studied history and then studying languages.

[01:42:40.760] - Speaker 3
And to be honest, trying different things.

[01:42:43.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And to be honest, I disliked my school experience up through high school. I was so emotionally unhappy that when I really luckily got to escape to college, and for me, it was a total reboot. Like, no one knew me. Tabularasa people seemed actually switched on about things, and suddenly I was like the kid in the candy know. I kind of wanted to sample everything, so I didn't have a sense of directional thing. It was more just like, oh, I get to just be enthusiastic without self consciousness. And that was a real gift. But I knew I wanted to go to New York just because New York had a. I can't explain why New York was in my fantasy life. It was like a place I wanted to. And it was like I had the Beastie boys in my. There was that version of New York. There was the talking head CBGB version of New York. There was the punk, there was the hip hop. There was Bruce Springsteen for me, was just a huge figure in my desire to get out of where I was. And I grew up in that Route 95 corridor.

[01:43:56.700] - Speaker 2
Some of his tracks, like New York City serenade and 10th Avenue freeze out. And he painted this picture to me that I was like, I'm going into that, right? And then there was Scorsese's films, and New York just had everything to me. I really thought, like, that's a place. And I still feel that. I think it's changed a lot, but it has a density of collisions. And when you're young, the thrill of being in New York to me was you literally might go from one scenario to the other scenario in two or three blocks with five minutes of walking. And I loved the density of the collisions in New York was nuts. It was everything I wanted when I was that know, I wanted all of it. And I wanted to have a lot of unexpected encounters and everything, but I went through this thing of going. I literally would still have these sort of flip eyes where I'd go, like, I am going to go apply to the State department and I'm going to go work for the know. It sounds really weird, but I wanted to live abroad. I had lived in Japan for a minute.

[01:45:19.400] - Speaker 2
Just, I was studying Japanese and I was studying aikido. And between two years in college, I just was like, I'm going there.

[01:45:27.880] - Speaker 3
And how was that experience?

[01:45:29.130] - Speaker 2
Amazing. Really exotic and great. I lived in Osaka. It was a huge city, but it was so amazing. It was the first taste I had. It was the first window I had into the recognition that what's going on in America is not the be all and end all in other places that the world's a lot bigger than. No matter how big we think american culture is, sometimes it's really big. And people do know.

[01:45:58.660] - Speaker 3
No, but we tend not to look outside.

[01:46:00.680] - Speaker 2
No. It was like going to another planet. I really felt like I was on another planet. No one had any reference point that was familiar to me, and I was healthy. And good. But did you ever read, this is a weird reference, but there's this really obscure essay called within the context of no context. Have ever you read that? George Trow. Trow. It was kind of famous among New York intelligentsia, kind of like the way they talk about Marshall McLuhan and the whole idea of the medium is the message and all that stuff. But this guy, basically, he wrote this. And it's funny because your book. I really enjoyed reading your book. Your book's kind of reminded me, too, of Milan Kandera, the great check writer. His book, it's called the book of laughter and forgetting.

[01:46:54.160] - Speaker 3
I've never read that.

[01:46:55.130] - Speaker 2
And it also is just like one page you turn and it's just got a paragraph this long on it. And the next page is a full essay, and the next page is a thing. It's beautiful, but within the context. And no context is kind of this meditation on the idea of, like, does a thing have an intrinsic quality, or does what a thing is exist outside of the context that's around it? And I thought about it when I was making motherless Brooklyn, even, because I was thinking about that thing of like, do I want to set it in the modern times or do I want to set it in the 50s, make it about this thing. He has this one line in that where he says, in America today, if I walk down the street wearing a fedora without irony, it would crush my head. And I really think there's something in that, because we're not a homogeneous culture anymore. We're not a white dominated now we're becoming a true polyglot culture. But it does an interesting thing, which is it means that there isn't a context that men wore fedora hats without thought. Because in the context of the time a man wore a fedora hat, there was no commentary.

[01:48:22.080] - Speaker 2
There was no commentary in it, right? Today, your self selection is an assertion of something, whether you mean it to be or not. And he was kind of, this was way ahead of his time because he was basically saying, we're heading toward a context of no context, and what is that going to do to us? And I think some of all this, there's a lot going on today about identity in all forms. And I feel like he was meditating on that. Then he was kind of saying, what happens when there's not a unifying context? There's a lot of liberation in that. And Bowie was on that, too. I feel like. I feel like he was way ahead. I think one of the reasons we were all obsessed with him was. He kind of was like, I am completely outside of any context that you want to put around me. Even rock, even the nothing that you even think a rock star is. Fuck you. I'm an androgynous alien in a kabuki. It's like, oh my God, oh my God. The liberation from him was a whole other order.

[01:49:43.180] - Speaker 3
How did you decide to put the movie in the 50s instead of now? Why did you make that decision?

[01:49:50.220] - Speaker 2
Because it was two things. One was I really wanted a context in which the character with Tourette's isolated because the context of the time is not sympathetic or evolved. I wanted a less evolved social context in which he's a freak and in which treating a person in the way that he needs to be treated to be isolated is not. Today we'd almost acknowledge that that's not the way you should treat someone. And I wanted his isolation to mirror the isolation of a young black woman in the. Wanted there to be a theme of people who aren't seen for what they are so that his condition makes him not seen for what he really is. She's a black woman and so she's not seen for what she is. And then I also think that Robert Moses is the dark people thought he was the parks commissioner and he was an autocratic racist who ran the city. And there's like danger in not seeing some things for what they are. So I thought you could.

[01:51:13.000] - Speaker 3
Solved a lot of issues by putting it in the.

[01:51:17.640] - Speaker 2
Also in the 50s was when in the US, in american cities, we baked in a lot of the discriminatory injustice that we built. The projects we created. Things that became like poverty traps, like social ghettos. I mean that happened in the 50s. Prosperous african american and jewish and latino neighborhoods that were real middle class neighborhoods got raised so that Pratt housing could get built. And that kind of stuff was intentional. So it was also like a thing, I think that was worth that. That was kind of what I was interested in.

[01:52:05.660] - Speaker 3
But should tell you about moving to New York.

[01:52:09.480] - Speaker 2
You know, I loved it. I loved New York. It was. You moved to the city in the.

[01:52:13.850] - Speaker 3
Mid eighty s. I went to NYU, I think in 1981.

[01:52:17.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think New York was probably even tougher in the 80s than in the.

[01:52:25.200] - Speaker 3
For sure.

[01:52:25.730] - Speaker 2
I mean it was like.

[01:52:26.810] - Speaker 3
For sure there were still like boarded up buildings everywhere.

[01:52:30.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean in the think Brooklyn still had a lot of edge and Harlem still had a lot of edge. But I don't know. I don't know. It's impossible. New York probably still has a lot of edge if you're a certain age. I love that New York's a world city. I love that it's like, did you.

[01:52:52.620] - Speaker 3
Move there, though, with a mission? Like, did you move? You just wanted to live in New York?

[01:52:57.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I figured I felt like I was going to find the adventure that I wanted.

[01:53:03.020] - Speaker 3
And what were some of the adventures that you got?

[01:53:07.100] - Speaker 2
Know, I worked for a thing my granddad had set up that was a housing development organization. And it was great for me because I moved to New York, and one of my early jobs was I went all over the five boroughs, interviewing people who had left a shelter and gotten into good, affordable housing. It was like we were making the case for how important access to affordable housing is. Right. It was that kind of thing. And that's all great. It was great work. It was cool. To the people who were doing that work, I still kind of think of as very heroic people. Like, I really admired them.

[01:53:49.400] - Speaker 3
And you must have met some really interesting.

[01:53:52.300] - Speaker 2
But I was lucky. I had my little Nikon camera and a little mini cassette recorder, and I would knock around all over into mostly lower income neighborhoods and stuff. And I was interviewing people, taking their pictures and interviewing them, and I was almost like a gopher. But I was getting to see a lot of the city and encounter a lot of people. And I waited tables. I had bizarre jobs. I have this memory. I had a job. I wasn't even a job. I used to do a thing for extra dough because I could read fast. I found out that I couldn't type, but I had a girlfriend who worked quartz. Stenographers take the transcripts of quartz, but it's in code. They take a tape deck and they read, this is the way it used to be. Then they read it. Someone who can type sits with a tape and types it all out. And they got paid the best up here. And then the typist got paid this. The bottom of the thing was the proofreader. The law firms and the courts had to have court documents and depositions and court testimony proofread. So the bottom of the pecking order was, you could go to these services and you could take as much as you could take.

[01:55:27.400] - Speaker 2
They would say, it has to be backed by x, right? But they paid seventeen cents a page.

[01:55:32.720] - Speaker 3
And you could read fast, and.

[01:55:36.620] - Speaker 2
I could read like 100 pages an hour.

[01:55:39.900] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[01:55:40.480] - Speaker 2
Right?

[01:55:41.660] - Speaker 3
Have you always just had that ability?

[01:55:44.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I was good at reading and good at words and things, but it was also almost like a game because you were reading it, but you weren't sitting there and trying to absorb it, you were looking for errors. And a lot of it is like, Rick, did you ask her at that time if you could come? Edward yes. Rick and what did she say? You know what I mean? But there was format stuff that they wanted you catch. And here's the thing. In every batch that you could take and get paid, seventeen cents a page, they put ten purposeful errors to check you. They couldn't go through and check it, but if you missed more than three, so they would just take it. They would check the ten planted errors. And if you missed more than three, you didn't get paid, right? So you had to be a little bit careful, right? I got pretty good at it. And I used to like, this is my subway gig. I would sit on the subway and try to pick up $17 an hour by reading fast, right? But of course, I was also doing my little downtown.

[01:56:55.520] - Speaker 2
I was moonlighting in play. I was doing my thing. I was doing acting classes. I was moonlighting in plays when I would get into them. And I was staying up too late and I would be tired. So I have two memories. One was I fell asleep on the uptown three express at like midnight or one in the morning trying to pick up a few extra bucks. And I fell asleep and I woke up, like in the South Bronx. I woke up and I looked around and I knew I was not like, where I wanted to be at 02:00 a.m. And I tried to jump off the train and they shut the doors. And remember they would like, he caught my ankle. And then the guy was like nudging the train forward. And I was screaming. I was like, come on. Come on, man. They let me out and I was like, whoa, maybe this. And then another time I was coming off an acting class in East Fourth street and I had this batch that was due. It was winter, and I was like, shit, if I don't turn this in, I think I got to go sit somewhere.

[01:58:04.540] - Speaker 2
And I was so fucking cheap at the time. I should have just gone and sat in the coffee shop or something, right? But I was like, I just have to find a quiet place, focus and get this done. And I poked into one of those NYU buildings near Washington Square park, and I kind of like went past this security guard. I was like, I'm just going to find an empty classroom. I poke around and saying, classrooms are locked, or there's things in. I'm like, shit. I go in this bathroom, there's this door, and I'm like, open this door in this NYU bathroom, and there's a storage closet, and it has, like, desks and, like, bathing room. And I'm like, great. And I'm so fucking nickelante. I go into this storage closet off a bathroom at an NYU building, and I sit down to do my proofreading, and I fall asleep. Fell asleep. And some janitor came and locked the door. And so I'm like, I wake up. I've missed my thing, whatever. It's nighttime and you're locked. I'm locked in a storage closet off a bathroom in an NYU building. And I start literally like, going, help.

[01:59:17.860] - Speaker 2
And I'm like, holy shit. I can't even get to the toilet. What's going to happen to me? I'm going to have to spend the night here. Did you. And I'm like, patting. Suddenly I hear these keys.

[01:59:31.340] - Speaker 3
Great.

[01:59:31.770] - Speaker 2
This dude opens door and this janitor, and he's just looking at me like, what are you doing? And I remember kind of having moments like that where I was like, you feel like, man, this is, like, marginal. What am I doing? You're like, going by the seat of your pants and you're kind of like, nothing. You're like, I'm not putting anything together here. What am I doing? And those were the times I'd be like, I got to get out of New York. I got to do something. I got to get a job or I got to do it. But every time I would contemplate what I was going to do and I had ideas or something like that, then I kind of would be like, yeah, but I did get this audition for this play, and I would always land every time I got right at the cusp of like, fuck this. This is just crazy. Something good would happen, something that was enough of a taste, a reinjection of what I was loving about it. And I kept going along. I mean, I feel mean you were doing music even when you were at NYU.

[02:00:52.400] - Speaker 2
I remember in high school, the zines and everything coming out of euro's early stuff. I mean, I remember the way Def jam percolated to remember. We had one station called WHFS. It was the mid atlantic alt rock station. It was where Spike Jones and I are both from. And here's the weird thing. I made some money one summer, and I started building my own BMX bike. And I used to cobble the parts together, and I would save up to get the right kind of pedals or Shimano cranks or whatever. And Spike worked at the only cool. It was like Rockville Skate and BMX.

[02:01:36.810] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[02:01:37.310] - Speaker 2
And I used to go there.

[02:01:38.950] - Speaker 3
So cool.

[02:01:40.320] - Speaker 2
And we're the same age. And he worked there as like a prodigy, like a kid. I think Spike has to have been at the place I used to go get my amazing skateboard trucks and stuff, which was really wild. But anyway, WHFS was the only place they played. Like the Clash and Brit pop and later REm and the Pixies and all of it alternative. Yeah, all the alternative stuff. And we didn't have any. There was no hip hop station right there in Baltimore, Washington.

[02:02:11.150] - Speaker 3
Same in New York.

[02:02:11.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, there was no hip hop station. So WHFS was the only place they put hip hop. You would get these little flickers of hip hop and then the Beastie boys and stuff like that. But in my view, that's happening by like Run DMC's like 86 or. No, even earlier, like 80. When was the first run DMC record?

[02:02:36.820] - Speaker 3
It's like maybe 84.

[02:02:38.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah, in high school. And we had this feeling that this thing was leaking down to us. Springsteen kind of talks. Did you read his biography? Did you read his autobiography?

[02:02:53.340] - Speaker 3
I didn't read, but I saw the Broadway show.

[02:02:55.420] - Speaker 2
Yes. Which was amazing. In his book, he has a really beautiful kind of section about what it felt like to live in a small town and how the radio was know from exotic places. And I really felt like the stuff you guys were doing, it was leaking to us through one channel.

[02:03:18.160] - Speaker 3
I had the same experience growing up on Long island and getting the music from New York.

[02:03:24.370] - Speaker 2
Like the Ramones. Were they big for you?

[02:03:27.880] - Speaker 3
Biggest.

[02:03:28.600] - Speaker 2
The Ramones were Ramones.

[02:03:30.060] - Speaker 3
I saw them play 50 times.

[02:03:31.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah, more. That's amazing. Were like the talking heads. They were CBGB, right? I mean, they were a big band.

[02:03:40.910] - Speaker 3
Huge, huge.

[02:03:42.600] - Speaker 2
Who else in that time?

[02:03:46.520] - Speaker 3
But also there was always that. And then like trouble funk from DC or Run DMC.

[02:03:58.220] - Speaker 2
I was in the Baltimore DC. So we had like minor threat and Fugazi were like our loved minor threat. They were pretty much the pinnacle of what was coming up and out of there. But there was that club, the 930 club. I saw Radiohead there at the 930 club. Holy shit. That's amazing. I actually remember. I can't claim that I went and saw them there, but I remember the police played the 930 club. And they were like the kind of band that was coming through like Outlando's Demora was coming through on that one alt rock station. And the know, were you getting involved enough in things that were lighting you up even while in college that you never had like a, this is marginal. I'm not putting anything together. I'm out of here moment. Like, basically, did it ladder up for you successively without, from literally, like college straight through to when you guys were setting that up.

[02:05:02.710] - Speaker 3
I thought I was going to have a real job. I didn't do music thinking it was going to be my job. I did music because that's what I love to do. And luckily music took over before I ended up going to law school or doing something regular.

[02:05:17.960] - Speaker 2
Did it just keep flowing and getting better and better such that you never had a moment of what I would call, like, existential?

[02:05:26.780] - Speaker 3
There was never an existential.

[02:05:29.420] - Speaker 2
That's so lucky.

[02:05:30.580] - Speaker 3
It was unbelievable. Unbelievable. I didn't even know it was a job. It just happened.

[02:05:37.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's really lucky because I think it's wild now that I have kids, their educational experience is so different from mine was like I really hated mine. They love theirs and I'm happy about that. To me, I'm great with if they're.

[02:05:56.170] - Speaker 3
Joyful, great, win win.

[02:05:58.730] - Speaker 2
But what's really weird is for me, it wasn't good. And then getting to go to college was good. Right. The more I look at american life, though, the more I think that in a lot of ways I'm lucky that I made it through to a point where, and I don't want to say non straight world. Like, I wasn't comfortable in the straight world. And by that I mean I never even contemplated where the taking world, right. I never even contemplated like, taking a job at a bank or going to law school or anything. I just couldn't see myself that way. But literally, because of what I experienced in college and the degree to which the definitions of success were very informed, by plugging into the next thing. As a result, I had existential, big existential doubt moments about pursuing a creative life. Big, right. And because my grandfather paid for me to go to college, I even had a thing of like, I have a responsibility to think, thank God he was amazing and told me, no, that's ridiculous. Like, the arts are the best thing in the know. He actually go, keep going for it.

[02:07:20.000] - Speaker 2
Right.

[02:07:20.540] - Speaker 3
In my case, if it wouldn't have happened the way it happened, I would have had a regular job that would have probably made me very unhappy. Yet I would still be doing music as much as possible.

[02:07:31.330] - Speaker 2
But it's interesting, isn't it? Because I think Flea's book is really beautiful. His chronicle of his young life is so beautiful in the sense that he assesses it with such wisdom. But I'm like, when I look at him and Anthony, or when I look at Bruce, kids who are left to their own devices in a way that we wouldn't want for our kids, necessarily, right, who have lives that have a lot of danger and a lot of uncertainty and a lot of instability and a lot of drugs and whatever you want to say. Like, flea, his chronicle is like, music saved his life. Like, music is the vector, and it's the only way up and out. So there's danger, but there's not necessarily an existential crisis, because it's like, this is the path. To me. It's a funny thing because. And I'm kind of wrestling with it now. It's almost like a veil. You have to deal with the fact that sometimes you think you've liberated yourself from certain things, but you still hold the dna memory of a way you were taught to view the world. And I am almost going through this thing because it's a long way from my kids being at college age, but I've almost come to this place where I'm like, I not only don't care if they go to college, I'm not sure I even want them to, given same.

[02:08:51.390] - Speaker 2
Given what I see going on. And I don't mean the modern fears about Ultra left on the thing. None of that. More that I'm not sure that even what I went through doesn't hold within it more than I was even aware at the time. A value system that's hard to break away from.

[02:09:15.010] - Speaker 3
Oh, there's the Marlon Brando line with the female character is saying how nice it is to be a little kid and to be free. And then he has the line about the indoctrination. Do you remember the line? I can't remember what it is. It looks like it's an ad lib.

[02:09:32.680] - Speaker 2
Is it in Las Tango in Paris? Yeah. Which, by the way, talk about a movie that you understand better as you get older. Holy crap. He's a super complicated, beautiful, tragic, in many ways figure. I think the film that I was talking about having that experience with De Niro on was Marlon's last film. Marlon was in it, and I knew him before it.

[02:10:02.480] - Speaker 3
How did you know him before that?

[02:10:04.800] - Speaker 2
I knew him because someone who was a friend of his said to me that he had liked some of the stuff I'd done, and then kind of said to me, you should go up and see him. And I was like. And he goes, no. This person said, no, he needs people. And what I started realizing is that there was a period where I think he was lonely. And I think that who he was almost, in a weird way, put a cocoon around him. I think there were people who got invited to kind of go and just bring him some stimulation and know youth and fresh conversation. And he and I. That's how I met him, through this mutual friend.

[02:10:54.950] - Speaker 3
What was it like meeting him?

[02:10:56.310] - Speaker 2
It was great. I feel, looking back on it, that I think Marlon was very guarded out of habit. The habit? No, not the habit. The long experience of too many people venerating him made him not tricky in a funny way, but he was a little coy. He would wait a bit to see what you were going to be like, to see if you were going to be gushy or if you were just going to have a normal conversation. Yeah, talk shit with him. And he was really funny. He really liked jokes. He really liked things. So I think if it got to. Oh, okay. You're all right. Yeah, you're just a pal. You're going to give me shit. You're going to think. Then you kind of met him, and I found him. I thought he was really funny. He was very interested in other people. He was inquisitive, wide ranging. You could tell he was like an autodidactic person. What he had learned, he had learned himself kind, was. I don't know, maybe in a way, maybe I got lucky. And he was in a time in his life when he was less. I know for sure there was stretches where Marlin was so contemptuous of the bullshit around him, and he was so contemptuous even of movies, and contemptuous of.

[02:12:39.140] - Speaker 2
He went through, definitely through periods of really disdaining his own talent, craft the form itself. I think he had a pretty. I don't want to say tortured, because that's not right. But I think he had real ebbs and flows in the measure of how much he respected even the form that he was known for and didn't want to talk about it and didn't want to think. Maybe I got to a point with him where he was comfortable enough, but I would ask him certain things, and I found him really. He was great. I talked to him about his early days in theater, and he was very relaxed and funny. He was really funny.

[02:13:21.450] - Speaker 3
You think it came from the fact that he was so deified that he felt like he was never seen for.

[02:13:28.500] - Speaker 2
Who he mean, you've seen, know, the big epic film on direction. Know, I don't mean this in the wrong way, but it's actually one of my favorite things Scorsese did. I think that's such an important film because it's a portrait of a person becoming an artist. But then also at an incredibly young age, having to defend the integrity of everything we've been talking about here against the onslaught. And I actually find myself pretty amazed. You watch this 20 year old guy who has the density and the sense of self and the awareness. Before there were even pop stars or any of it. You forget how few people had been made famous in that way. Like Frank Sinatra and like Brando or what, Elvis. But being told that you're the voice of a generation when you're 20 years old and having the presence to go, that's nothing I can relate to, and refuse to unpack the work. How many of us have ever refused to dissect the meaning when the ego stroke of the interview comes at you? You know what I mean? It's pretty unbelievable.

[02:14:49.320] - Speaker 3
What's cool about that Scorsese film? It's the first time you ever hear Dylan answer a question.

[02:14:55.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:14:55.920] - Speaker 3
Because up until then, it's always just sarcasm and deflection, deflection, deflection. It sounded like he was really honest.

[02:15:04.900] - Speaker 2
There's one part in it where they're cutting between the interviews with him, parrying with people. There's the famous one. He's at the table and the guy says, what is the meaning of this? And he goes, I don't know what it means. I wrote it. But that doesn't mean I don't know what it means. What do you think it means? Yeah. And I'm like, who says that at 20? Who in their 20 has people telling them, asking them to explain their stuff and saying that they're a generational voice? And goes, don't saddle me with that shit, man. I can't relate to that. You figure it out. And then to your point, they go to him. I think he was in his seventy s at the time and saying, yeah, I was very interested in Woody Guthrie's idiom. I mean, he literally goes, I was pretty interested in Woody Guthrie's idiom. And I took what I saw going on around me and put it through that. But I wasn't going to talk about it at the fine. It was like, to your point, finally it was like Dylan the craftsman, Dylan the guy who created characters. Dylan the guy who goes, yes, it was fucking constructed.

[02:16:18.040] - Speaker 2
Yes, I knew what I was doing, but I wasn't going to compromise it by unpacking it for you. I not only don't think many people, I actually think it's almost gotten worse. I'm not trying to stick a finger at colleagues or actors or anything. But lately I feel like awards, which are so antithetical to art, the older I get, the more grotesque I think it actually is. And I don't think people even realize how much they're being commodified. Their ego is being stroked as the mechanism for getting them to become a commodity, for a ratings thing and for ads being run, all this shit. It's an agenda. And when you realize that awards are an agenda, you're just like, this is doing such violence to the purity of work and the connection to people. It's just horrible, right?

[02:17:17.870] - Speaker 3
Yeah, but the more so hitting creators against each other.

[02:17:20.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's the worst. I don't think people realize how negative it is to the mission of having people experience what you've done, to sit in your costume, talking about how much you admire the director and them saying you're just like. You're completely atomizing my chance to have a moment of willing suspension of disbelief and to have the magic trick of the whole thing, which is the whole game. And it's just like, why would you do that? And again, to see someone who, even at 20 years old, understood that if I let you behind the curtain, it's over. It's over is really, really amazing. And I think that Brando, you have to really go back and almost refresh yourself on the fact that when he did streetcar name desire, he was 23 years old, and he woke up at 24 years old being told he was the fulcrum between the old world and the modern age. I mean, literally, like Miles Davis, Marlon Brando, Pablo Picasso, Bob Dylan, those people got treated as if they were the fulcrum between what came before and what came after. And if that happens to you when you're 24 and, yeah, you're doing your thing, but I think it fundamentally broke his trust with humanity.

[02:18:57.100] - Speaker 2
If you really get down to it, it broke his trust with people being rational and reasonable, and it totally broke his trust that anybody was looking him in the face and seeing him for.

[02:19:13.440] - Speaker 3
Who he really was. Who he actually was.

[02:19:15.460] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And that resentment. And so then the whole thing starts feeling fraudulent, and that resentment starts to cook. And I believe that he resented his authentic life being taken away from him. The opportunity for an authentic life, the opportunity for authentic interaction, for authentic. You know, why else do you go buy a tahitian island? Yeah, I was just going to say.

[02:19:41.640] - Speaker 3
Probably why he wanted to live in Tahiti.

[02:19:43.330] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Where people didn't care or whatever. I think that is pretty tragic. It's pretty tragic for a person that young in life to feel that their chance to wander in the world. He said that. He told me one time he was like, for all the world. All I wanted to do was go dig ditches. I just wanted to go to Italy and work on a road crew and just have beers with guys after work. And I think he never wore it comfortably because he never reconciled with it. Right. He never reconciled with what I think he feels it ultimately took away from him. But last tango in Paris is pretty amazing because my theory on that film is it's the last time that he invested in the work and that this could be a totally crackpot theory. But Marlin chewed gum. In a lot of movies, if you go watch it from Streetcar onward. Streetcar. He's chomping on a piece of gum the whole time. I know it sounds weird to say, but in the context of the world at the time, that alone was sexual. Like, it was oral. People didn't do that. It's not just that he's sweaty and in a t shirt, and he's got it on him.

[02:21:02.630] - Speaker 2
He's chewing on his gum. He's just visceral and present and things. And if you watch it, I think it was like, whether it was a conscious or unconscious, I think it's one of Marlon's tropes. He's chewing on gum a lot because it's grounding, it's relaxed, it's whatever. And in last tango, if you watch at the end, when he's dying, he takes a piece of gum out of his mouth and he sticks it up under the railing of the balcony before he dies.

[02:21:34.260] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[02:21:34.950] - Speaker 2
And in my mind, he's done.

[02:21:38.720] - Speaker 3
And he never chewed gum in movies after that again.

[02:21:41.280] - Speaker 2
I mean, in whatever.

[02:21:44.750] - Speaker 3
Yes. Fascinating.

[02:21:45.800] - Speaker 2
I think my theory, too, is that last tango is just him. The varnish is gone. Most of what he says is about his own life in the movie. It's improvised, and most of it's about him. Their story is from his real life. And I think that he essentially just. He lets himself be seen as a person without any affect, and he wraps it up, and I don't think after that. I think it's the last time he invested in communicating.

[02:22:21.900] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[02:22:23.020] - Speaker 2
Really? In the work. But also, by the way, when you watch that film, part of me goes, that's what we were talking about in the beginning. Part of me goes, he may have gotten to the point where he said, well, all that's really left is the lack of artifice in any form. Your diary, right. Last tango is just diary from Marlon. It's mostly personal diary managed by Bertolucci or whatever. And after that, what are you going to do? Go back to fake teeth and a military costume or whatever? It's like, I get it. I get, in a way, these sort of, like, this has run its course. What do you do after you've done that? Yeah.

[02:23:08.940] - Speaker 3
So it turns into the Vegas act instead of the.

[02:23:12.940] - Speaker 2
Or a paycheck or whatever. And then there's the feelings that come with doing a thing for the wrong reasons. And I think he had that, too. Like, kind of, like almost a kind of shame.

[02:23:27.930] - Speaker 3
Like you didn't live up to your gift or.

[02:23:33.540] - Speaker 2
I'm going to put it another way. I don't think it was that with him. I have a theory that in some ways, there's a certain kind of shame that comes when you don't have the courage of your convictions. And I think his conviction was that he didn't want to do this anymore. And his conviction was that it wasn't worthy, that he wanted a different kind.

[02:23:59.680] - Speaker 3
Of life, but he still was doing.

[02:24:01.840] - Speaker 2
It, but he went back for the money.

[02:24:03.230] - Speaker 3
Right. I see.

[02:24:05.950] - Speaker 2
And I think that there's a feeling that comes with not sticking to your convictions once you have them. But that's that thing we were talking about, too. What, John? And taking breaks, whatever. It takes a lot of courage to stop.

[02:24:19.130] - Speaker 3
Absolutely.

[02:24:19.850] - Speaker 2
It takes a lot of courage to stop doing a thing that you've done well and that you get a lot of regard for and get a lot of money for, and choose the fullness or richness or diversity of your life and a grounded human experience. And so I think if you're Marlin and you keep saying, oh, this is all bullshit, and I don't care about any of it, and everything I'm going to do, Superman, it feels like everything.

[02:24:46.990] - Speaker 3
We'Re talking about today is the same story. It's all about you, really. It's amazing. Well, I think we keep coming back to the same story of that. Having the courage to step away and live.

[02:25:04.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah. But you know what? You know what? I think the reason Marlon, though, is an interesting one to meditate on, in a way, to me, and it's funny, because he played KUrtz right in Apocalypse now, but to me, he is a little bit of a Kurtzian kind of a figure, because I don't want to feel that way. But also not just. There's no reason to throw a thing you've done under the bus when you know it has beauty in it and you know it can be done in a pure way. And when you've had good experiences, and I don't think necessarily you even need to create false bright lines or declarations. Like, now maybe there comes a time some. I know one actor who said, I am retiring, like, I'm done, and told me that he declared it because declaring it would be a part of strengthening his commitment. Right. But I don't feel that. But I do think to me, like, maybe Marlon's, like the negative example, and we were talking about John and his breaks from the band. Right. That's a positive example to me. Because why? Because it refilled the tank or it brought around again to the place of desire, and then it can be done again with love.

[02:26:25.050] - Speaker 2
And that's what you want. That's what you want, I think, is like, to be able to renew or resuscitate, yes. But from a different place as a different person and different observations. Right. Different things to bring to it, but it isn't necessarily easy. But at the end of the day, it's like the ego. There's nothing but ego that makes you say, and maybe money.

[02:26:53.060] - Speaker 3
I think it's also the excitement. Like, I know if I'm presented with a puzzle, because I always think of the work as sort of like solving a puzzle. So this is a new puzzle that's presented. And thinking about it would be fun to figure out this puzzle, because every creative project is, like, a lot of things to figure out how to make them work.

[02:27:18.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:27:18.640] - Speaker 3
So it's fun.

[02:27:20.380] - Speaker 2
You also have the benefit or the pleasure of facilitating, helping other people get to their best expression. And that's kind of amazing. You're doing a service for someone else every time you work with them, which is pretty cool. What's the longest you've ever gone without producing music? Never. It's amazing.

[02:27:41.010] - Speaker 3
Yeah, it's always happening.

[02:27:44.980] - Speaker 2
Do you have moments of aspiration to be free of even the puzzle solving? Do you have moments where you say, I could use a mental sabbatical from.

[02:28:04.060] - Speaker 3
I definitely have the feeling that you said earlier of, like, why? Why did I make the choices I made? But usually I have that feeling, like, in the morning, it's a beautiful day, it's sunny outside, and I want to go for a walk on the beach. And I know there's going to be a group of people waiting in the studio for me, and I said I was going to be there noon. I have to be there at noon, and I don't want to go. That feeling of when you commit to something, you have to show up. And usually the commitments happen in advance, right? So I commit myself in advance. And then when it comes time to actually show up, I don't want to show up.

[02:28:43.320] - Speaker 2
Right.

[02:28:44.010] - Speaker 3
Then when the puzzle is presented, when I get there and we start figuring it out, it gets really fun and I love it. And it doesn't always go well. Like it often doesn't go well. And that's interesting too. It's not as much fun and I don't go home at the end of the day in as good of a mood when that happens. But it's just a matter of patience because I know it's not done until we do solve the puzzle. And I wish we would have solved it today, but we didn't and it's okay now. At least we know these things don't work. The solutions we've tried don't work.

[02:29:18.740] - Speaker 2
Do you get the feeling sometimes that. I guess one thing I feel sometimes it's that things take longer than you think they're going to take.

[02:29:35.800] - Speaker 3
It's true.

[02:29:36.650] - Speaker 2
And that thing we're talking about, about putting a commitment, a brick on the wall, a commitment, commencing something and it could be building a house somewhere. You know what I mean? Yeah. But I think one of the negative dividends of getting some things done and they go well and they kind of reinforce your mind, oh, I've got capabilities to do more than one thing at once and now I've got the resources, now I got the help. So I'm going to commence different things. And at least in my case, sometimes I'm like, wow, I thought I could do multiple things at the same time, and I can, but they now are obligations that are carrying on, that have more durability than I thought they were going to. And it takes a longer time to unclip and liberate yourself back to simplicity. I don't feel old, but I think when I was even younger I thought that I was going to get shit done faster than it turns out. You can complete projects and stuff like that and then, like you said, you've engaged other people in collaborating on it. And then it's an obligation which is challenging.

[02:30:58.440] - Speaker 3
But I also like making other kind of things. I started making some documentary projects and the book was a different thing and it took a lot of time. So sometimes I think it's more interesting to do something I haven't done before. But I'm also really. I love music, can't help myself.

[02:31:18.200] - Speaker 2
But that takes me back to my kind of my mounting observation in life that a lot of my friends who work in music sustain that. The passion for it, that it continues to.

[02:31:38.240] - Speaker 3
It is truly a devotional practice.

[02:31:40.260] - Speaker 2
It really is. And I think a lot of my friends in music have maintained greater simplicity in life that, like, music's enough, you know what I mean? And that's not to be reduction, say people have family lives and they're complicated and if your business these things. But sometimes I think that impulse to do a diversity of things, to exercise different muscles, express different, express yourself in totally different ways, is really satisfying. And sometimes. But that's where you can start to go, like, man, I'm spinning a lot of plates. And then you can start having the feeling of like, am I spinning any of the plates masterfully, or am I spinning any of the plates in a way that's enjoyable? Am I allowing myself to enjoy one thing at a time to the full depth of what it has to offer? But I also think there's some point at which you got to get to where you can see the ways you're different from other people, you can be inspired by people, but if you're kind of like, you got to just get right with yourself the way you are and go, so and so's life is different from my life.

[02:33:07.920] - Speaker 2
Whatever. We're all taking it on in different ways.

[02:33:12.090] - Speaker 3
We have to play our own hands.

[02:33:13.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah, we have to play our own hands.

[02:33:14.770] - Speaker 3
I'll ask this as it relates to theater, because it'll be easier to think about because you do it the show, night after night. Do you feel like when you're doing something every day, are you always either getting better or worse, or does it ever plateau?

[02:33:33.780] - Speaker 2
I don't know if I'd say better or worse.

[02:33:38.200] - Speaker 3
Changing.

[02:33:39.220] - Speaker 2
Changing for sure. More than you'd think. This can apply in movies, too. But I think that I had to get my head around that is, I think, pulled from music as an analogy, is that you want to believe that you're going to be able to find emotional connection every time. And when there's an audience involved, you have a different relationship. You feel the people have come to see you make that connection. Right. You can be doing a play, you can even be doing a film, and you can be on take 24 and going, I don't have it. I don't feel it. I'm hitting the notes, but I don't feel it in a funny way. That's when an actor is a musician in the sense that your body is the instrument, your voice is the instrument, your emotional. You're assaying this role thing. You have to trust that you've done the work and that you are hitting the notes, that it can connect for people because you've done the work. It is connecting that you can't possibly feel it to the depth of your soul every night, whether you're an actor in month three of a really great play, that some nights you weep within the moment that you've done many, many times because it hits you.

[02:35:21.560] - Speaker 2
You've got it, and you're right there inside it, accessing it. And your emotion is even authentic, and they're feeling it, too. But then on the night that you're playing the score and your head's a little over here, it's okay. It's not a cause for panic, and it doesn't mean it wasn't good. It doesn't mean you didn't deliver. It doesn't mean whatever. I mean, our friends that we've been talking about, I saw the guys on this tour. I mean, they've been touring for fucking two years, practically. Now. I've seen it a bunch of times. I saw them in 19. I want to say I saw them in a bar in New Haven called toads. Remember toads? Yeah.

[02:36:09.210] - Speaker 3
I think my punk rock band played it, toads once.

[02:36:11.610] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think I saw, like, when mother's milk came out, when John Jones band and mother's milk came out, I saw them somewhere like that right after that, because John and I are the same age. So I was, like, 19. He was 19. And I feel like if you've seen people play a lot, you can kind of tell just like, oh, he's in the zone. Like a basketball player or whatever, where you can be like, oh, they look tired tonight. You know what I mean? Nobody says they don't deliver in their show. Like, their show kills, you know, Charlie Parker had his head off in something else on nights when his virtuosity people were like. They were melting. But you got to be okay with that. I think you'll just have to remember.

[02:36:58.810] - Speaker 3
That the audience that comes to see you doesn't get to watch the show every night and doesn't get to compare your performance. No, they just see one.

[02:37:06.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:37:07.370] - Speaker 3
And the one they see is the one they remember.

[02:37:09.710] - Speaker 2
And also, yeah, for you, it's like a little bit of zen stroke. And this curve might not be as perfect as you did it last night.

[02:37:18.880] - Speaker 3
But to them, that's the picture.

[02:37:20.500] - Speaker 2
And also, what you're doing is the totality of what you've been doing. It's not your perfect connection to it. On a given night. And it's funny because that's a pretty unique thing to the performance arts. You know what I mean? There's not a lot of analogies that I can think of where if you phone it in in soccer, you're going to lose. You know what I mean? When you're trying to create magic in the live setting, you just can't do that professionally and not allow yourself to rest on the muscles you've built sometimes and be okay.

[02:38:07.020] - Speaker 3
Yeah. And you're representing yourself in this moment. So sometimes, maybe if the performance to you is less good, it's still authentic in where you are in that moment and it's real.

[02:38:25.590] - Speaker 2
Well, that's really interesting, too, because more than a musician, an actor has a text that they got to stick with. Right. For me, one of the things, it's a real nuance, but I grew up a little bit in certain plays that I did when I realized that what you just said is true. It's not even that. I may not feel it, but I have to be okay with hitting the notes. It's actually a little further. It can change based on where I am tonight. I can be within the same text. I can be a little colder. And the play is that tonight, it's not that I have to hit the same notes, but be faking it a little or phoning it in. It's actually, I can channel where I am. I can keep it authentic by let within reason keeping.

[02:39:24.400] - Speaker 3
And it sounds like that also would inspire the people you're playing against. They're going to change based on your change.

[02:39:34.590] - Speaker 2
It's like everything changes, then you're in a dynamic. Yeah. And that's where it is. Like a band, but that makes it.

[02:39:40.540] - Speaker 3
More, like, improvisational and more keeping it real.

[02:39:43.970] - Speaker 2
And it gets back to that challenge of just being available to what's actually. It's a weird thing to say, but someone who is very committed to that is Bill Murray. I've only done Wes Anderson films with Bill and hung out with him a little in life, and. And it's not that Bill's not super appreciated as a really great actor, in addition to being Bill and being funny and everything, but he is extremely serious about his commitment to being available to what's actually happening.

[02:40:23.550] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[02:40:24.680] - Speaker 2
In the work and in life. And sometimes it almost seems like he's being provocative. But I think that he, among people I've met kind of in my trade, whatever, he really wants to just respond to the moment. And I've seen him in life in some ways that were a little unnerving in some ways that were really funny. Some ways that were kind of heartwarming. I've seen him kind of not be happy when he sees a disconnect. A disconnect. And he'll stick a fork in, make it real, go. Kind of the snapping of the fingers in the work. It's really cool.

[02:41:07.900] - Speaker 3
So Bill is in the moment. Anyone else you can think of that has that kind of in the moment feeling? Yeah.

[02:41:17.470] - Speaker 2
I mean, you realize people come at things in just very different ways, even within what looks like the same thing. I'm sure musicians are the same. It's like there's people who are highly improvisational and fluid and some who. For whom preparation and really conscientious sculpting and crafting and sticking to that matters more to them, or is that. That's their mojo.

[02:41:49.980] - Speaker 3
Would you say you're more in the second school?

[02:41:54.180] - Speaker 2
I think it depends on the gear I'm in. If I'm just acting in something, it's a more pleasant experience to have wide latitude to discover and flow and everything. But I think actors have to be in the best scenarios. You are there in service. You can be a primary collaborator in creating a thing. The chemistry of every single thing is different, just like it is. I keep saying music, but sometimes you got one person who's really the band. They write the songs and it sings and there's people who are brilliant, but they're the leader. And sometimes it's totally different.

[02:42:37.850] - Speaker 3
It's like things and there's no right way.

[02:42:39.930] - Speaker 2
Every single film, every single project is a different chemistry of relationship and collaboration. But I think as an actor, you have to be prepared and enthusiastic to step into and service the vision that a director has, the frequency that they're trying to establish, and even it sounds like the you. If you're going to make a movie with Wes Anderson and you try to come to it in the same gear that you're in, it's just not going to work. You must know love, appreciate and be conversant with Wes's language, not just because.

[02:43:26.200] - Speaker 3
It'S not like anything else.

[02:43:27.830] - Speaker 2
You're there to service. You're there to play a role in his company. Yes, and what a pleasure. What a delight. It's a thing. I think when I'm directing, I would like to do something that allows for more improvisation and fluidity and discovery as a storyteller, as a director. The things I've done, it's really weird. Not really weird, but when you shoot in New York, like shooting mothers, Brooklyn. I had so much less time than I should. I don't say should you work with what you got. But there was no way to make a big period 1950s film in modern New York City in the schedule that I had without a nearly maniacal amount of preparation. The fun was that I was able to go to almost exclusively New York actors that I've worked with and know and were all from my orbit and say, I need everybody here, like a play we can rehearse. I need everybody to be tight, to be ready. I'm not going to be able to do a lot. We're going to have to move pretty quick. And I only involved people that I thought would deliver, and happily, who was in there?

[02:44:56.480] - Speaker 2
They're all arabian horses, all thoroughbreds, theater trained, theater experienced, able to come and know that they're helping me by bringing the goods ready and fast. And they did, and it was great. Did it mean that with some of my favorite actors, I was able to play? No, I wasn't.

[02:45:20.000] - Speaker 3
Understood.

[02:45:20.510] - Speaker 2
I wasn't. But you got to work in the. You got to play with, like you said, the cards you're given, you know what I mean?

[02:45:29.360] - Speaker 3
How different would your performance be depending on the person you're performing against?

[02:45:36.940] - Speaker 2
I guess it can be really? Yeah, I mean, it can be hugely affected.

[02:45:43.840] - Speaker 3
Have you ever done a play where the character that you play against changed, like, the person playing the character changed over the course of the play?

[02:45:53.910] - Speaker 2
No, I haven't ever had that.

[02:45:55.620] - Speaker 3
I'm curious to how different that would be.

[02:45:57.540] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that would be strange because you.

[02:46:00.570] - Speaker 3
Build a rhythm with the person, right? Like, if the person is more energetic or talks faster.

[02:46:10.920] - Speaker 2
You know who Ossie Davis was? Great writer and actor and director. I did a film and got to be friendly with Leslie Odom, who he played Aaron Burr in Hamilton. Brilliant singer, brilliant actor, and he's got this revival up in New York right now of this play. Otzi Davis wrote in the. Was completely blown away by it. It made me, I don't know if I was in a headspace of going, God, New York theater. How antiquated. I kind of walked in, maybe I just was in this mood of, like, hadn't been back in New York in a while and I was, God, like, what is theater? What is like, how many people is this for? Is this work anymore? Does it, you know, I had a lot of that going on in my head, and I walked out of there going, that's why theater exists. That is why it exists.

[02:47:14.560] - Speaker 3
That's the best.

[02:47:15.820] - Speaker 2
Because it couldn't have been anything else. And it was so heightened and so delightful and satirical and great. But I also really, Leslie and this actress, Cara Young, they were performing in a gear. I don't know how to describe it. It was so boldly operatic comedic, almost like comedia del Arte. It was like something you would expect, like, you know, like those great John Patrick Chandley plays that were big and operatic. And she was doing things physically that I was sitting there as an actor. I was sitting there and going, what would bring you to that choice? I was gobsmacked. I was like, I can't even wrap my head around where you got the indication that that's where you should go because it was so whacked.

[02:48:29.610] - Speaker 3
But it worked.

[02:48:30.660] - Speaker 2
Unbelievable.

[02:48:31.520] - Speaker 3
Wow.

[02:48:31.970] - Speaker 2
Unbelievable. I didn't even know how to describe it. I was just like. Afterwards, I was literally doing the we're not worthy kind of, like thing to them both because it was so theatrical. It was the definition of real theatrical art. It was floating way up above reality. It wasn't behavioral naturalism. It wasn't moving insight. It was just this totally elevated thing. And it's great.

[02:49:10.310] - Speaker 3
Sounds great.

[02:49:11.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's funny in the way that a lot of the best things in any form, it feels to me, are things that shouldn't work, and it's like the force of talent is hauling it down. I felt that way about HamilTOn, honestlY. I'm not a musical theater aficionado or huge know. I don't say I'm not a fan, but it hasn't generally been my know. I saw that a couple times, and I actually got emotional a few times watching it. I got emotional over the audacity of the whole thing. I imagined him walking around in the Bronx with his headphones on and his pad. Right. Having the balls and the conviction that he could write something of that magnitude.

[02:50:04.780] - Speaker 3
Yeah. I had that feeling about Hamilton, and I had that feeling about Book of MormoN when I heard about them. You're like, that sounds like the worst idea ever. Yeah, the worst.

[02:50:13.930] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:50:14.900] - Speaker 3
And then they were mind blowing. Both masterpieces.

[02:50:18.850] - Speaker 2
I agree. Both of those.

[02:50:21.960] - Speaker 3
I totally, on paper, bad ideas, bad idea.

[02:50:26.310] - Speaker 2
But there was something about the scale of the creative audacity of Hamilton actually made me cry. I was just so blown away at the size of the swing and also just the magnitude of it is Like a huge double album or something. The scale of it is just, like, incredible. The density of it. And it's always something like that. That is what transports You. Like you're. Did you see the movie triangle of sadness? I had a swedish filmmaker who I think has made some of the best modern films, triangle of sadness was like, it functions like a dream. Like, if I said to you, oh, my God, I had the most whacked out dream. I dreamed that my girlfriend and I were arguing about the check at dinner and who was going to pay, and it got so heated that we were fighting in an elevator over it. And then we were on a yacht and Woody HArreLSon was the captain, but there was russians there, and they made the crew swim, and then there were pirates, and then we were surviving on a beach, but the toilet attendant became the queen. That's how it works.

[02:51:48.740] - Speaker 2
It functions like a surreal dream. And again, it's almost like knowing when you know something about making movies, you're almost more impressed because you know how hard it is.

[02:52:04.920] - Speaker 3
Nothing about it's supposed to work to break out of.

[02:52:09.660] - Speaker 2
Like, I saw some interviews with Freddie Mercury about Bohemian Rhapsody or. And it's just like, it shouldn't, right? Like, there's no bridge, there's no nothing. There's these things. None of the things that are the way you do a song. And now we can't live without it. You know what I mean?

[02:52:25.120] - Speaker 3
It's just like, those are the revolutionary works, the ones that don't fit any. They don't check any of the normal boxes when they work. It's the most fun thing to see.

[02:52:36.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Because you got shown something. I don't know if you feel this way. I think the people I know in music really do have kind of a religious relationship with music. And I think because music's not, because it's so primal, because it's vibrations, and because people get so affected by it, it's like sacrosanct. I don't think the culture even, nobody questions that we need music. I definitely do go through things where I just sort of go, I know art has value. I know it helps people. Like, I think Joseph Campbell's really right, that if it's opaque, it tends to be more narcissistic, if it's transparent and a person can see through it and say, oh, that's really about me. That's when it's mythological. And I do agree with that. It makes people feel not alone, or it makes people perceive the universe differently and that there's some value in that. But I definitely will go through some things where sometimes I'm thinking, like, the productization and commodification of content will. Sometimes my cynicism, it's like an opposing force. It is like an opposing force. And I love films, but I literally. I do get to a place sometimes where I'm like, are we making opium?

[02:54:18.180] - Speaker 2
Are we just making opium? And giving people, like, something to check out in front of for a minute, you know, a palliative against the stress of modern life.

[02:54:30.890] - Speaker 3
The answer is with Birdman. No.

[02:54:34.200] - Speaker 2
I hope so. I hope that's right.

[02:54:35.870] - Speaker 3
As an example.

[02:54:36.760] - Speaker 2
I hope that's right.

[02:54:38.780] - Speaker 3
There clearly are examples the other way.

[02:54:41.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, many too many. And photography and everything. But being lucky enough to know some people who I think have done incredibly heroic and important work, that's like, in direct service of other people, sometimes my brain goes, you've done enough of this. You know what I mean? I'll get to this place where it's just be like, I know this. You won't agree, but sometimes I'm like, there are voices that are coming into the mix that need to be heard. Like, literally more than mine. And I just go, I've done this enough. I've done this enough.

[02:55:26.790] - Speaker 3
There's room for everybody, though.

[02:55:28.380] - Speaker 2
I know it's true.

[02:55:33.160] - Speaker 3
It's not a zero sum game.

[02:55:34.600] - Speaker 2
No, it's not a zero sum game. But I have my ebbs and flows, too, of just like, what does the world actually need? You know what I mean? But it's probably overthinking it.

[02:55:54.890] - Speaker 3
Yeah, your part isn't what the world needs, it's. What's your diary entry?

[02:56:00.190] - Speaker 2
Yeah, what's your part?

[02:56:02.660] - Speaker 3
That's all.

[02:56:04.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I guess the other thing is we know people who work in tech and things like that too, right? Everybody goes through thing. You think you're painting the future or something. The truth is that not even the long term future, the immediate future, is so unknown and so unpredictable. Like you can say, I engage with what I think is like, I think that the issue of what we're doing to the environment of our planet is important, right? Because it is going to affect people and intrinsically, I think it's important when you take a breath and you step back and you just realize, like, you can throw yourself against ideas of how you can contribute and what needs to be done and everything, and you have to acknowledge that in six months something can happen that makes everything moot. You know what I mean? And then when you acknowledge how small your life is within this massive uncertainty about what are going to be the emergent phenomenon that actually define what things look like in the future, you come back to the place of saying, well, in that case, hopefully it's not selfish to say, then I ought to think about just the existential quality of the way I'm spending my time, which gets back to being present, being available, allowing yourself simple pleasures of just existing.

[02:57:57.560] - Speaker 2
And in any day that you've got the blessing that you're healthy, you're not being bombed, don't squander it.

[02:58:06.860] - Speaker 3
Do you feel like there's a spiritual dimension to your work?

[02:58:12.160] - Speaker 2
At times I have. And I guess when I'd say spiritual, I don't necessarily mean divine. But I think that there's actual gift of service if you're trying to connect people to each other. Like, there's that thing we were saying about when we were talking about empathy. If the work's got empathy and you know that through it, you're reaching out to other people to say, we're in this together, and you can see yourself in this. We're talking to each other, then, yeah. And it's really interesting because people can be absolutely ridiculous and disconnected in the way they come up to you because they know you. But when people come up, kids, or when anybody comes up who's present and isn't going, like, I'm so excited because I know you or something. When people are coming up with presence and connection and saying, man, that connected for me, how can you be in any way cynical about greatest feeling in the world? You cannot be cynical about people affirming back to you that they felt seen, they connected, they felt open. It's the best.

[02:59:33.670] - Speaker 3
Best.

[02:59:34.150] - Speaker 2
Then you go, okay, this is as worthy as anything else.

[02:59:37.570] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[02:59:37.860] - Speaker 2
I mean, when we were. When we were working on Fight Club, it's very reverent. We were laughing our asses off. There's no question in my mind that sitting in the room was the awareness that this is for us and our friends. Our parents will not understand this. They probably won't like it. They won't relate to it. They won't get the lingua franca of it. This is ours. Yes. And we better go for it.

[03:00:11.060] - Speaker 3
It's the best feeling.

[03:00:12.280] - Speaker 2
We better go for it because we've got in our hands the vehicle to remember what it felt like to be in a certain place at a certain time for a certain group of people. And that was an interesting experience, too, because it was one of my first experiences of feeling that sensation that strongly. And then the commodification, it didn't go well at all. You know what I mean? Like, that movie was like a flop in the beginning. And Fincher was, I think, felt very bruised. And I remember we showed it in the Venice Film festival, and Brad came up to me right before we walked into the big red carpet. Stupidity and all that stuff. He said, how do you think this is going to go? And I said, I don't think it's going to go well. And he said, me neither. Let's get high. Right? And of course, because he came in on a private plane, he had like a joint like the size of a large cucumber and he's a pothead. We smoked this joint. Walk into the Venice thing. I felt like someone was carrying me by my ears 3ft off the ground the whole time.

[03:01:21.050] - Speaker 2
But it was great because he and I watched it. My recollection is that we saw Scorsese walk out, which was also kind of like. Like. And then it was. Right. It got. And it was. There were booze and we were in the last row in the back. And Brad turned and looked at me and goes, that's the best movie we're ever going to be in. And I said, me too. We were like hugging each other.

[03:01:47.140] - Speaker 3
How cool is that?

[03:01:48.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, we were teary eyed.

[03:01:51.020] - Speaker 3
That's real.

[03:01:52.820] - Speaker 2
And he said, that's the best movie we were ever going to be in.

[03:01:55.350] - Speaker 3
Unbelievable.

[03:01:56.360] - Speaker 2
While people were booing.

[03:01:57.660] - Speaker 3
Yeah. It wasn't a joke.

[03:02:02.640] - Speaker 2
Now I want to be careful. Maybe I was stoned and I don't. I think my recollection is that Scorsese walked out of it because I also think I remember that hitting Fincher in a way. But this is all a little hazy, to be honest. Or very. There's. But I hope in a weird way that I am remembering that. Right, because Fincher had a thing on the office wall when we were rehearsing and it said, like, on the path to enlightenment, you have to kill God, kill your parents and then kill your teacher. Right. And I remember thinking, like, if Scorsese walked out, we did it. Like we killed our. Like, fuck the critics. But if we feel good, even if our hero walked out, then we're in good place.

[03:02:52.030] - Speaker 3
That's an incredible story. Thank you for telling me that story. I love that.

[03:02:57.270] - Speaker 2
Yes. It's funny. But then it was to your point. It's like it finds its way.

[03:03:02.650] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[03:03:03.020] - Speaker 2
It's just. It is what it is.

[03:03:04.370] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[03:03:04.940] - Speaker 2
Like you can't.

[03:03:06.310] - Speaker 3
No.

[03:03:07.580] - Speaker 2
And in a weird way, like with that one, what could be more true to everything it's trying to say for it not to do well, yes. And then be something you'd never trade. Like you'd never trade how that one went into everyone in our friends that we made for it, for you wouldn't trade it for a billion dollars. It'd be a sign of defeat if it was.

[03:03:39.640] - Speaker 3
But to know it in the moment while the people are booing, to hug each other and know, this is great, that's really bold. I love.

[03:03:51.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah, there's something too, where you just like, you know, like when you're showing. They should have never shown that movie in Italy with some titles. It's like, that should have, you know. Yeah, they shouldn't have showed. They should have showed that. I don't even know what it should have been. In a college auditorium with free tickets for everybody. No pretension, no nothing. Do you miss life in the cities.

[03:04:22.000] - Speaker 3
Of your youth, not in the zero?

[03:04:27.560] - Speaker 2
I think I know that about you. But do you think you knew? When do you think you realized that you were ready for a big fundamental shift of scene from the energy that catapulted you into the kind of work you wanted to do, like, you didn't take a break from it, but when did you just go, I got to do this a different way. Yeah.

[03:04:52.620] - Speaker 3
I never knew until, it's like, I came to California to work on a project. I hated California. I loved New York. Came to California to work on a project, was here for like nine months. I ended up buying a house because I was tired of staying in a hotel. And I thought, well, when I come from New York, I'll have a house to stay in. And I just ended up never going back and grew to love it. And then the next time I went back to New York, I remember feeling like I can't remember what it was that was keeping me know. I didn't know. And the same thing happened when I moved from in town to Malibu. At first, when I got a house in Malibu, I thought, oh, that's really far away. And then when I moved here, it's like, far away from, like, nothing I want to go to is anywhere but here.

[03:05:41.980] - Speaker 2
I know I had a similar, because as an east coaster, Baltimore and then York, and, like, I had a total prejudice against LA in particular. And I would come out here and work and get out of here as fast as I could, and I totally missed the whole trick. I thought LA was like West Hollywood, and everything that's truly great about the state is like, the space and the light and the ocean and the mountains.

[03:06:08.750] - Speaker 3
And the beauty right next to each other.

[03:06:10.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah, in the desert. But embarrassingly, it took a while for me to perceive what was get out of the Matrix in a way and perceive.

[03:06:23.800] - Speaker 3
No, because we were indoctrinated.

[03:06:25.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah, we were I was in New York, snotty about being like a New York theater actor and doing thing, and there was always that line, I think it was a Neil Simon thing. Someone said to him, like, why don't you. They're making all your plays in the movies, why don't you come to LA? It's like when the weather's just so much better and everything. And supposedly he said, yeah, when it's 30 below in New York, it's 76 in LA, and when it's 110 in New York, it's 76. But there's a million interesting people in New York and 70 in LA.

[03:07:01.770] - Speaker 3
That's pretty good. And, you know, it's just not true. No, what it is is there's good and bad people everywhere and you just got to find your people.

[03:07:12.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think that's right. For me, it was partly because coming out here meant working in the movies and because LA, it's very diverse, but it feels like an industry town.

[03:07:24.230] - Speaker 3
If you're in the industry, it is an industry.

[03:07:26.010] - Speaker 2
It's an industry town, I think it is. And in a way, it's seeking to unfold you within its hierarchies. It wants to define you within its hierarchies. And if you're resistant to that, then you just want to get the fuck out of here.

[03:07:58.180] - Speaker 1
Close, different.
