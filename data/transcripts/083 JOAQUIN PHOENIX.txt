[00:00:07.380] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. I do think that in those moments when thought stops and something emerges, it doesn't invalidate the thought process for me. I don't feel like, Oh, well, that was a waste of time. I shouldn't have put so much thought into it because now when I'm not thinking something's emerging. I think they are interconnected in some way that is beyond my understanding, at least.

[00:00:46.720] - Speaker 2
When something takes over that's good, what do you think that might be?

[00:00:57.830] - Speaker 1
I mean, hopefully it's just part of something that has That's like existed and it's accessible to anyone that maybe is open to it, right? You're just like riding this wave. Yeah. And I don't know precisely what it is or its importance or whether it's important at all. Every once in a while, you have on a project, there's several times on the project where it's like... It's not there. Yeah, but all around, it's like, it's now or never. Yeah. We're on a clock, and there's a lot of people that are waiting, and they've done their work, and their work's fucking solid. And are you going to be solid? And that's really uncomfortable to look up and have people looking at you and you realize, I don't have it. It's not there. Yeah.

[00:01:49.790] - Speaker 2
So in that moment, what do you do? What happens?

[00:01:54.450] - Speaker 1
Well, I've got a partner, the filmmaker, right? So A lot of times you just got to work your way through into, well, what isn't working? What's uncomfortable? What's the block? And sometimes you can identify. Sometimes it's maybe it's something in the writing or it's something energetically. It's about moving through the room. I think oftentimes, again, it's a thought process that's getting in the way that I can't identify. And when I was younger, I was working with the Scott. It was such an important moment for me, but we were doing this scene, and I had just a really overwhelming, powerful feeling. I didn't even know what it was. I didn't identify it with any blocking or how it was going to emerge. I just remember I had this feeling, and I knew that I wanted to start off this moment just looking at myself, looking at my hands. I didn't even know why, what that was. I was really was Really supportive of that. I don't know if it was 24, 25 or something. We did this scene, and we did this scene and we did the master, and there was this feeling of like, okay, well, we're in something.

[00:03:13.980] - Speaker 1
This was in the latter part of the day after lunch, we started the scene. And so by the time we got this master, we really said, Look, we're not going to be able to get to coverage tonight. So we're just going to do it. We just got the master. I go, No problem. Because why? Because I'm the shit. I know what I'm doing. I fucking got it. It hit me. I'm riding this thing for good. And I made that horrible mistake of going home and feeling like I accomplished something. And we came back the next day and I walked in like, I got this. It's like that. It's a little bit of just, yeah, certainty or arrogance or whatever it was. Just like a lack of reverence for this thing that I had stumbled into prior. And we go to shoot the first take of the coverage. And I mean, it's instantly it comes to a scratching halt. I can't even get through the take because I'm so embarrassed. And I thought that I owned it and I thought I was in control. And it just slapped me in the fucking face, man. So I remember just going, That's it.

[00:04:29.530] - Speaker 1
I'm lost. And there's no magic. And Ridley came to me and he was like, What's going on? I said, I don't know. It's just like, looking at my hands, turning this way, I walk over here. I know it now. It's already been done. So there's nothing left. And he said, Do the opposite of everything you're doing. And I was like, What? He said, Just do the opposite. I said, Yeah, but that's not... What the fuck is that? Plus, it's not going to match even if it was good, right? So you think you have to repeat your move. I said, Who cares about matching? Just do the opposite. And so I looked at the back of my hands, and then instead of turning left, I turned right. And then instead of saying this line loud, I said it quietly. And it was terrible. He said, go again, do it backwards. Just, again, backwards is terrible. And by the third or fourth take, without even being aware of it, I suddenly was going back to matching my things. And I felt this thing coming back, and it was just a rediscovery. And it wasn't adhering to what happened the day before.

[00:05:39.330] - Speaker 1
And it wasn't desperately searching and trying to come back to this thing. And something emerged there that was different and maybe better than the previous day. And that was a really important moment for me. And to think that such a simple direction that had to do with just physicality could alter and open up whatever it is that's receiving all of these other things.

[00:06:14.150] - Speaker 2
When the viewer sees a motion on the screen, does that mean you're experiencing that emotion or not necessarily?

[00:06:23.460] - Speaker 1
Not necessarily. Tell me about that. Well, it's surprising. I think there are times where all of these elements, the music, the camera lens, the movement of the camera, the color of the wallpaper, the lighting, where it sits in the story, in the film as a whole, all of these things are working to affect the viewer. I've seen rough cuts of films and watching a scene going, This is terrible. There's a lot of emotion there, but it seems way too... What is going on? I don't know, I'm being so confused because I was like, I know that I'm coming from the right place. That's what the character would be feeling, and it is that extreme, but it's not working. That's so strange to me. Then I spoke to the director. I said, We got to reshoot that. It's This is really painful. It's an important scene, and it just feels wrong. And he said, Okay, we can talk about it. There are things we are going to redo, but let me just work on it a little bit. And then he asked me to come in a month later or something to watch another cut, and that scene came on, and it was pretty good.

[00:07:49.240] - Speaker 1
Wow. How?

[00:07:51.000] - Speaker 2
What changed?

[00:07:52.080] - Speaker 1
I don't know exactly, but where it sat in the story that you just were connected to the character in that moment more. And so you understood what they were going through made sense, and you suddenly identified. And while it still felt big in a way, extreme, you understood why. You felt it with them. Where part of that, there was a distance. And so it felt like somebody was being histreonic. And that was a really an amazing, humbling moment as an actor, where you really have such an appreciation for a filmmaker and the process of editing and what goes into it, how much you can shape a moment.

[00:08:39.340] - Speaker 2
You talked about the master shot that was the magical shot and then coming back the next day to do the other shots. Is it always done that way? Is there always a master shot and then you have to repeat it?

[00:08:53.350] - Speaker 1
No. The few directors that I've worked with recently, oftentimes, will start with the coverage with me because I have... I do get bored easily. Yeah. And once that thing has happened, once there's been some discovery, it's very hard for me to go into coverage. If that's happening in the master, part of the thing with shooting a master is you're establishing movement as well, just your physicality in the space. And then sometimes you get to the coverage and you're like, I don't want to go over there anymore.

[00:09:34.110] - Speaker 2
You already did that.

[00:09:35.210] - Speaker 1
It's like, well, you've gone. And so part of it is like, okay, we'll find in the coverage what feels best.

[00:09:42.360] - Speaker 2
Is there any way to do with two cameras, do Both at once?

[00:09:46.370] - Speaker 1
Sometimes they can do that. I mean, Ridley, definitely, he's got four cameras going. So it can be done sometimes. And there's value in that. And sometimes there's also value in Getting to that place where you go, there's nothing left. I don't want to do this. And you push through. And it's true, there was nothing left the way that you were approaching it. But now you're forced to approach it in a new way. And something else emerges. So I don't go in saying, hey, this is the way that I work because I always feel like I don't know what's best. And sometimes a director will come and say, Do you think, Should I shoot your coverage first or I shoot the other actor's coverage first? And I go, I don't know. You should make the decision what's best for you. Every once in a while, you feel like something is right on the edge of coming out and let's go for it. And you try it and you were wrong. It wasn't there.

[00:10:51.470] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you'd never know in advance. Can you?

[00:10:53.100] - Speaker 1
No, I think sometimes your body's buzzing. You just something, but it might be just the buzzing before disaster strikes, and then you've got to shut down. In the example, again, of the master shot, When there's magic, can you always feel it? No. I mean, look, magic. I don't know if it's fucking magic. It's just was like whatever that-It's a good word.

[00:11:27.470] - Speaker 2
It's a good word to explain because we don't know what it is anyway. Right.

[00:11:31.490] - Speaker 1
Yes, both things. There are times where something appears to be magical and seems really great, and vice versa. There's times where you're like, Whoa, there was something there. And then you see it, you're like, Eh? Yeah. Wow, wasn't that great? And other times we were just like, Yeah, that was just nothing. It was a nothing scene. And you see it, you go like, What? That was much more depth than I thought that I felt at the time. It was something. And those are the moments in some ways that you're most appreciative of, right?

[00:12:07.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah. When you think maybe it's not great, and then you see it back and it really works. It feels good.

[00:12:14.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it feels good, and it's humbling. It's good to just be reminded. Yeah, we don't know.I don't know. Yeah.

[00:12:22.200] - Speaker 2
Can't know. How would you say your relationship to performance has changed over the course of your life?

[00:12:34.280] - Speaker 1
I don't know. I don't know that it has. I want to perform less. I want to think of it less as a performance, but I don't know that that's the case. When I was young, me and my siblings used to sing on the streets. We go to Westwood, and my brother would play guitar, and the four of us younger kids would sing. We would do these rehearsals with my dad overseeing it. For some reason, it's just my nature was to be in opposition to any suggestion that my dad might have had. And with it, this attitude or this belief or feeling of like, just get me out there.

[00:13:29.030] - Speaker 2
Let me do my thing?

[00:13:30.180] - Speaker 1
But put me in a real-world scenario because I can't be on the hollow deck right now with you, right? Coming up with this thing because it's not real. We're in this living room. I can't do it. But we're on the streets and there's a field of crowd there, and I actually have to go out with their hat to collect a dollar here. I don't know, let me go. And I think in some ways, maybe there's still a part of me that has that. That's like, let's go into the real-world situation where I might totally fuck up in front of everybody. And then maybe I can... I wonder whether... I'm 49 years old. It was over 40 years ago. And I part of me wonder if I'm still fueled by that same thing in some ways.

[00:14:28.240] - Speaker 2
Was that indicative of your overall relationship with your dad, or only is it related to the playing out?

[00:14:38.190] - Speaker 1
I think with everything that I do, a little bit, I'm a bit cursed with like a, Don't tell me. But I'm always reminded how much I need someone else and how appreciative I am. But no, I think in terms of other things in life, I think that I was open. I just felt with that creative part couldn't have.

[00:15:08.990] - Speaker 2
I understand that.

[00:15:10.080] - Speaker 1
Yeah?

[00:15:10.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:15:11.850] - Speaker 1
I imagine it's very difficult for the filmmakers I've worked with because they are, 90% of the time in the last 15 years, I'd say 90%, maybe 95% of the directors I've worked with, they were the authors. They wrote the script as well. Usually, they're the filmmakers where it's quite personal. It's not hired to write a genre piece. It's something that comes from a very personal place. So it's incredibly difficult for them to hand it off. And I think that I am somebody that feels like I need to feel like this is my life, not this is your life that you know that I'm plugging into. This is my life.

[00:15:59.040] - Speaker 2
That's what makes it a real collaboration, though. You're not just a stand in for them. You're there to contribute.

[00:16:07.520] - Speaker 1
Right. But it still must be very difficult for them. And there are times where sometimes as a contribution. I feel like sometimes they look at you like your child, where you're like, I can see that you are going to go up those stairs in a dangerous way that's wrong, and I want to tell you, Stop. But I also I have to allow you to make that mistake, and you're going to be a better man because of it. But it must be so... I know how hard it is with my son, and I know sometimes directors just look and going like, Oh, what you're doing is just so stupid. That's so wrong. You're just approaching this scene all wrong. And I have to sometimes go, I know. Trust me, I feel how bad this is.

[00:16:53.220] - Speaker 2
Just please let me fuck up.

[00:16:54.380] - Speaker 1
Please let me just get this wrong because if I can own the mistake and I can live in it, then maybe.

[00:17:03.550] - Speaker 2
You can find your way.

[00:17:04.650] - Speaker 1
Maybe. And yes, and I need you to tag me here and there and pick me up a little bit, help me dust off. And sometimes you're like, yeah, If you see something like it, when you have a camera, there's a frame and you, as the person within the frame, you're going, well, all of this is happening. It's all what's going on my leg here and this. I go, No, we're not seeing any of that. So you may think that this is standing out and this is what's working and this is what isn't working. You're wrong.

[00:17:41.600] - Speaker 2
Might not even be on the camera.

[00:17:43.880] - Speaker 1
Here's the only thing that matters. Sometimes that's like, Okay, thank you.

[00:17:51.520] - Speaker 2
That's interesting. Yeah. Wouldn't have thought of it.

[00:17:54.820] - Speaker 1
For most of my career, I didn't watch playback. Fairly recently, five years ago, I started watching it more. And not all the time. Just part of it was to Just to have that perspective, to sit with the director and watch it take and to talk about it a little bit. It actually, it seemed like it was helpful in some situations, but maybe not. It just feels like it might have been.

[00:18:33.480] - Speaker 2
It didn't feel like it screwed you up, though.

[00:18:37.200] - Speaker 1
No, I think I got over that when I was younger, it just made me so self-conscious and insecure. And I think as I was older, it just made me recognize all the other work that's happening around me. Just like, okay, hold on. I don't have to deliver the entirety of this film in this one moment. The whole movie is not resting on this one take that I'm doing. I'm actually a part of it. That's why you're like, Oh, fuck, well, that lighting is... That's doing most the work. I just need to just...

[00:19:17.190] - Speaker 2
You just need to be there.Be there.Yeah. Would you say you live in your head or your body?

[00:19:30.050] - Speaker 1
I mean, I probably in my head more. Yeah.

[00:19:33.770] - Speaker 2
Always been the case?

[00:19:37.200] - Speaker 1
I think so. Yeah, I'm not sure, but I am also so aware of feeling and emotion in my body, and I'm not sure which one.

[00:19:54.070] - Speaker 2
Would you say you are moved through the world or you move yourself through the world?

[00:20:04.410] - Speaker 1
Both things. This feels like what I am navigating always in life and in my work. Ultimately, I feel like I don't have control, but I do so much work to get there. There are times where I think I do a fight. I I like a fight and I'm comfortable losing. I'm comfortable laying on the ground and going, Okay, okay, okay, you win, you win. You got me. But I don't start there. And part of me wants to, part of me maybe Sometimes I do. Sometimes, hopefully, I'm getting better at just coming in and saying, Okay, what is it?Not.

[00:20:53.510] - Speaker 2
Every at bad is a home run.It's.

[00:20:55.220] - Speaker 1
Not.it's impossible. Every scene can't be a special scene. It shouldn't be. Some scenes that are just connected tissue. But there are times where everyone knows like, Oh, boy, this is an important one. You walk on set, just It always just feels like dead man walking. Somebody's walking on set. Just go like, Oh, man, this is going to be bad. This is going to be bad.

[00:21:27.440] - Speaker 2
Have you found any practices that help you get through the difficulty of the job?

[00:21:40.260] - Speaker 1
I don't know that I want to.

[00:21:42.440] - Speaker 2
That's a good answer.

[00:21:44.800] - Speaker 1
Again, I think there's something that feels right about it being difficult because here's the thing. In some ways, it's fucking easy in that there's a whole system set up, particularly as an actor and as a known actor. Things are set up to make it as easy as possible for you, right? Everyone's there like, Can I get you anything? Can I get... And so in some ways, I feel like I have multiple takes. It's not like you're shooting the free throw and you're down by two and somebody's screaming, fans are like, Fuck you, you suck. There's none of that. The other actors are like, Hope you fucking bite. You know what I mean? When you think about other things where professionals are at it. It's so funny. Right? So in some ways, everybody is there to help me be the best that I can be. Yeah. And maybe there's some part of me that feels like, Well, that can't be good. It's okay, but we also need to make sure there's some fire here. There's something to fight against.

[00:23:01.590] - Speaker 2
Tell me about meditation. Is it something that you've practiced?

[00:23:05.370] - Speaker 1
It's the thing that I'm always trying to practice and feel like I'm failing at. I've had some good runs, and then I'll just lose it. I literally have in my calendar on a repeat, morning-night meditation to remind me to get up, take advantage of this time. It's been a bit more difficult with my kids because I like to get out and make breakfast with my son. I'm just not forcing myself to get up early. I was in this thing where I just was waking up at 5:00 AM. That was easier. But no, I've struggled. I've struggled with it recently.

[00:23:51.920] - Speaker 2
How would you say the dynamics of your current little family compares to the dynamics of your childhood family?

[00:24:06.510] - Speaker 1
Well, our circumstances are so wildly different. I mean, It's funny because literally just this morning at 2:00, and my son woke up and he's ready to leave. Our youngest, she's a bit colicky. It's really difficult when a baby is crying like that. It's just so hard. I I've been away, just doing press for a week. My wife has just been doing this on her own. It's just so much for her.

[00:24:37.800] - Speaker 2
She's doing okay with it?

[00:24:39.140] - Speaker 1
She's strong? Yeah, she's amazing. She's amazing. But I go, How am I Five parents have five kids. They don't even have any money. No help. Nothing. I mean, the difference in wealth between my parents and me, it's insane. And so look, obviously, I have a lot of my dad's biology and personality and everything. And yet I have such a different support structure. He didn't have the family that I have. His father was long gone out of the picture before he was in his adolescence. And my mom, she's just an incredible, grounded, strong, and beautiful woman, and my sister's great siblings. So my kids now have that. They have that, and my mom and my sisters are great aunts there, and they're cousins. So it feels... I think when I was a kid, it was an isolated family. It was very much of step or fashion with what was acceptable in some ways. My parents were counterculture. And growing up, I think it was just probably more difficult to find like-minded people, where now I think it's much easier. And so people feel a connection to support and whatever their beliefs may be. Whereas at the time, we were always the only people that were the vegan or were being homeschooled or whatever alternative medicinal practices that they may have been interested in.

[00:26:37.020] - Speaker 1
And so that's something my kids are not going to experience, right? Probably more than likely. They are in a world.

[00:26:46.680] - Speaker 2
They won't feel as much like outsiders.

[00:26:49.700] - Speaker 1
I don't think so.

[00:26:51.180] - Speaker 2
How was your parents' relationship? Did they get along well?

[00:26:56.180] - Speaker 1
There was deep, profound love and a unity, like a shared goal, a shared belief, and a shared foundation, and a real powerful love. But then I think after they'd been together for... I mean, they divorced when I was... Or they split up when I was maybe 15.

[00:27:21.890] - Speaker 2
So they were at a-When it happened, did it make sense to you that they split up?

[00:27:26.650] - Speaker 1
Or was it-Oh, yeah. I was like, Fuck, please. Oh, yeah. No No problem with it at all because you're kids, you love both your parents. You go whatever makes you guys happy. You want them to be happy. Yeah. For me, I was old enough. I imagine every kid feels different So I don't know what my youngest sibling feels like. It would be different being 12 years old versus being 15. But for me, it was fine.

[00:27:57.540] - Speaker 2
Tell me about living in Costa Rica.

[00:27:59.200] - Speaker 1
My dad first went there in, God, '90, '91 or something like that. It was very different. It was like an eight-hour, nine-hour journey. There's a bus from San Jose It was harrowing. And of course, when you're 14 or 15 and you think you're invincible, it's just the best time. It was just like, oh, so exciting. It was just amazing. Then you would take a ferry Ferry cross, and you'd hope to catch the right ferry. If the bus was late, you might miss that one. Sometimes you have to stay in the night. Sometimes you make it, get across the other side, all dirt roads, bumps. It was adventurous. And anybody that was there was there because they were adventurous. It was just a small little town and just great people. A really eclectic group of people.

[00:28:55.810] - Speaker 2
Where were the people from that you'd meet?

[00:28:57.390] - Speaker 1
All over the world. German, Swiss, Italian. Yeah, all over the world. It was this spot. Again, this is before the Internet. So this is all just word of mouth.

[00:29:09.080] - Speaker 2
How do they even know? Yeah.

[00:29:10.790] - Speaker 1
One person goes down there and sells their friend.

[00:29:13.480] - Speaker 2
What do you think all the people who went there were looking for? What was the shared interest?

[00:29:20.380] - Speaker 1
I don't know. I think some of them just wanted to escape. They weren't even looking for something. They were looking to get away. They always felt like there were a few people that seem like a little shady, like those expats that are like... But I think a simplicity, a return to nature. We got there, almost everybody rode horses. There weren't cars. That's cool. It was like everybody in the room. It was just like the owner of this bar hotel had a car and this one as well.

[00:29:55.800] - Speaker 2
Everyone else had horses?

[00:29:57.100] - Speaker 1
Horses or he walked. That was it. He just walked.

[00:30:00.590] - Speaker 2
Did you learn to ride a horse there? I did.

[00:30:03.480] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:30:04.230] - Speaker 2
Were your parents into theatrical stuff? Were they into performance?

[00:30:08.910] - Speaker 1
I think my dad harbored a desire, but it was so far removed from what his experience was growing up. He was a real working class kid from Fontana. Again, just a real tough upbringing. I don't think he could even dream of something. I think it was like he was also probably like, if he told his brothers that he wanted to do a school play, they'd probably call him a pussy. Is that culture. So I don't think that... My dad was probably the real... I know he was a very sensitive person. It's deeply sensitive. But he came from a tough place. He spent most of his teenage years in juvenile hall. He was a fighter. I remember he wasn't a fighter, but he had it in him. He wanted a peaceful resolution. He didn't want to be a fighter. Yeah, but he would not fucking back down. I saw him in some situations that just scared the fuck out of me. But also, you felt like, Well, this wild animal has got my back. I'm just going to do whatever he can. He can. He's a really interesting guy. Also, he played guitar. I think he probably did have a desire to be a singer-songwriter.

[00:31:45.820] - Speaker 1
Again, I don't think he really knew how to do that.

[00:31:50.850] - Speaker 2
What was his taste in music? What did he listen to?

[00:31:55.370] - Speaker 1
Well, when I was older, he loved Steel Pulse was It was the band. I was like, and obviously, some of those records are fucking amazing.

[00:32:06.740] - Speaker 2
Would there be music playing in your house, usually or no?

[00:32:10.900] - Speaker 1
There was a lot of Beatles. My parents, they liked Beatles, but I don't remember my… Again, we didn't really have things. Early on, I think it wasn't until I was 11 years old that somehow we had a record player. But I don't think anyone even knew that one of the speakers wasn't working. It was like that.

[00:32:41.230] - Speaker 2
Did you feel like you had a home base, or did you feel like you moved around enough to where you felt like you just lived wherever you were?

[00:32:49.860] - Speaker 1
Felt like we had a home base, even though we may not have. Never felt like-Because in the group, you felt home base. Solid, no matter what it was, we had such... My parents had such faith, and we in turn had that, that there was never a moment. That's beautiful. I remember being aware that we were struggling financially. But I think some of that in some ways was a choice. I think there was this point they just relinquished all materialistic items and lived by faith and trusted in that, trusted that we were going to get That sounds great. It's pretty magical, to be honest. It was. Again, I don't know what it was to be a nine-year-old girl in that situation. Maybe my youngest sibling feels differently about it. But I think that, I mean, I know that we all felt safe and provided for. And I think there were those moments that defined you and giving our dog away. We had to because we were traveling across the States and we couldn't feed him. And my dad was in a parking lot of a grocery store. My dad literally was going in and trying to find somebody that would take this dog.

[00:34:23.450] - Speaker 1
And he did. He bounced, but he was a fucking genius with some stuff. My dad was very resourceful. He found this guy, and then we watched the guy come out with a big bag of dog food. We were sad that we were parting away as a dog and then so happy that we knew that he found this new home. There were those experiences that, I think, shaped us. Whatever it was that we were going through, we went through it together. It's that simple. I don't know what more you'd ask for.

[00:35:06.180] - Speaker 2
That sounds great. Tell me the different places you lived.

[00:35:10.490] - Speaker 1
I was born in Puerto Rico.

[00:35:13.340] - Speaker 2
How long did you live in Puerto Rico?

[00:35:17.210] - Speaker 1
Probably a year or something.

[00:35:19.840] - Speaker 2
So no real memories of Puerto Rico?

[00:35:21.280] - Speaker 1
No.

[00:35:22.090] - Speaker 2
How did your parents end up in Puerto Rico?

[00:35:24.280] - Speaker 1
My parents lived in Puerto Rico. They were with this group called the Children of God. And there was a...

[00:35:33.200] - Speaker 2
Like a commune?

[00:35:34.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was a commune. I think it felt like it was a commune, a shared commune of ideas, ideals. And they had some friends that they met, I believe in Texas, who were going there. And so they said, You got to come to this place. It's amazing. We're all living together. And I honestly don't know the details of what sparked it for them. But I know that they both had a... I think what they would describe as a profound spiritual awakening of just a shared belief of like, well, we don't want to raise our kids in this system. So they went to Puerto Rico. I always thought that everybody lived in this place in Puerto Rico. But I think that the main group was somewhere, I don't even know where.

[00:36:41.420] - Speaker 2
So what's the first place you remember?

[00:36:44.080] - Speaker 1
The first place I remember was Venezuela.

[00:36:47.520] - Speaker 2
How old were you in Venezuela?

[00:36:48.840] - Speaker 1
I was probably two and a half years old this time. I was the third born. My mom was pregnant with my sister, Liberty, who was born in Caracas. And my first memory is being in a pool, my dad holding me, terrified of the iguanas that were going along the pool.

[00:37:13.030] - Speaker 2
How big were they?

[00:37:14.040] - Speaker 1
I mean, to me, they were fucking dinosaurs, right?

[00:37:16.480] - Speaker 2
They really do look like dinosaurs.

[00:37:18.450] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's incredible. It's incredible. And so my dad basically was the caretaker for this elderly woman, and she allowed Let us to stay in this room that was off of her house. As I recall, she was not a wealthy person, but I think she more took pity on my family. My dad was like, If you let us stay here, I'll do whatever I can. It was that situation.

[00:37:47.920] - Speaker 2
So that wasn't a community based on the group that they followed?

[00:37:53.390] - Speaker 1
No. They had been friends with a local priest in Venezuela, and I believe they went to him and they said, We have to get out of here. We have no means. Can you help us? He had a friend that worked on a ship that was exporting Tonka Toy trucks from Venezuela to the States, and it was going to Florida. And it happened that my grandparents, my mother's parents, lived in Florida. We were still away. Somehow this person got us on this ship.

[00:38:32.900] - Speaker 2
Do you remember being on the ship?

[00:38:34.100] - Speaker 1
I remember very clearly because... Because this I remember clearly because... How old were you at that time? So I turned three years old on the boat. And I think I remember this because I turned three years old. Okay, so first, let me clarify. So when I say Stoways, we couldn't have been really proper Stoways because people knew that we were there, and they knew it was my birthday, and they baked me a cake. But I think we were there free. It was like somehow-They were being cool.

[00:39:03.490] - Speaker 2
They were being cool. They were being cool.

[00:39:05.390] - Speaker 1
Because I don't think it wasn't a passenger ship.

[00:39:07.610] - Speaker 2
No. You have your birthday on the boat.

[00:39:09.950] - Speaker 1
My birthday on the boat, they bring out a cake. Again, we were living very simply.

[00:39:15.910] - Speaker 2
How many of you were at this time?

[00:39:17.690] - Speaker 1
There's four of us. At this point, my sister has been born. My sister, Liberty, has been born, and my mom was pregnant with my sister, Summer.

[00:39:26.120] - Speaker 2
And that's everybody.

[00:39:27.450] - Speaker 1
Yes, there's four of us. Summer would be the last one.

[00:39:30.120] - Speaker 2
Everybody was there except summer wasn't yet born.

[00:39:33.350] - Speaker 1
Summer wasn't yet born. Okay. They baked me a cake, a birthday cake, and they gave me some Tonka Toy Trucks. Never had toys. Awesome. Never. I don't remember any cake, anything like that. So that was monumental feeling a real sense of safety and love and care from strangers. Yeah. But then the other event, and I've talked about this a great deal I was hoping I'm not boring you, but...

[00:40:02.540] - Speaker 2
I don't know any of this. Tell me everything.

[00:40:04.050] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[00:40:04.770] - Speaker 2
I love this story. What a cool life. It's grand. It's awesome.

[00:40:10.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And so with this love and support from these strangers, which obviously meant a lot, I think it's something that I think that I was aware of how much we relied on people. You just sense that. But then I remember they were catching fish on this boat. And I imagine it was for themselves. I imagine it was obviously wasn't a fishing vessel, right? It was probably just for this journey. But they were catching fish in a net. So it was like, what seemed To me, I remember, vast amounts, maybe it was 20. I don't know. But they dove them on the side of the ship, the platform. We were there, this is outside, and the fish were flapping around and they would throw them against the side of the boat to stun them. And I think as children, this was so shocking to us to see how vibrant and full of life and how desperate. I think it quite captures that desperation as wanting oxygen and what the body does almost without control. It is beyond a choice So that desperate, flailing movement is so shocking. I remember we were all at... The kids collectively were just floored by this, and we were crying.

[00:41:45.130] - Speaker 1
And we were screaming, and we wanted it to stop. It's very hard for me to believe. But my mother says that I said it, and I remember one of us saying, Why didn't you tell us what this was, that this was meat. When we ate fish, you don't know, you don't understand that it was this thing. Now, my mom says that I said that. I was three years old, but having a child that was just three years old.

[00:42:17.330] - Speaker 2
They're smart.

[00:42:18.380] - Speaker 1
Fucking very aware and things come out and I was like, Okay, maybe I did. But I know that all of my siblings, we all had that same feeling, that same realization. From that moment, we said, We're never eating meat again. We're not eating anything.

[00:42:37.330] - Speaker 2
Has that been the case?

[00:42:38.410] - Speaker 1
And that has been the case.

[00:42:39.620] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:42:40.330] - Speaker 1
My parents, to their credit, honored that wish.

[00:42:45.610] - Speaker 2
This was the kid's decision, not your parents' decision.

[00:42:49.710] - Speaker 1
That's right. I think that years before, my parents had experimented with vegetarianism, and then they probably, to be honest, there was to the point where I think we were living however we could. But there was a decision. So I don't think it was a completely foreign concept to them. But I think it probably was, I imagine that it was difficult because they're just going like, I think they're going like, Do you know what it takes just to fucking feed six of us with another one on the way? We're just trying to figure this out however we can. And now we got these restrictions on us, I imagine. But I never felt that. So then from there, we arrived in Miami, and I remember seeing my grandparents from the boat, and I remember looking down at the dock and seeing them being pointed out and them waving.

[00:43:44.550] - Speaker 2
That's That's for mom's parents.

[00:43:45.660] - Speaker 1
That's for mom's parents. And then shortly thereafter, my brother, River, who I think you must have met, right? For sure. Yeah. I don't know where this idea came from. It certainly wasn't popular at the time, but he just felt like, how could we be? Why are we taking anything from an animal? And that just led to our veganism. And so my sister Summer was born vegan in 1977. And, yeah, we've been vegan ever since. So that's why I remember that it was a really instrumental part of our life and probably a story that we experienced. And then we talked about them a whole lot. So it was like one of those memories that It was like that period. It was a big transitional period for the family.

[00:44:34.990] - Speaker 2
How was Florida different than Venezuela?

[00:44:37.390] - Speaker 1
I don't know that. For you? Yeah. Well, what I remember is there was a Alfonso Sains. I almost remembered his name, Alfonso Sains or something like that, who I think might have been somehow involved in the music industry, maybe a record producer. I don't know for some reason. I don't know how this happened. I don't know where... I don't know why we ended up in Winter Park, which is outside of Orlando. I don't know how we got there because I don't think my grandparents didn't live there. I think they lived in West Palm Beach. But again, my dad was the groundskeeper for this guy.

[00:45:19.640] - Speaker 2
I don't know how-So your dad got a job. That makes sense.

[00:45:22.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, my dad got a job. Yeah, and that's why you moved. And we lived on the property. Makes sense. I remember it being good to move.

[00:45:29.600] - Speaker 2
How long did you live in Florida?

[00:45:33.050] - Speaker 1
So I got there. Summer was born. It was probably three and a half, almost four. Maybe I turned four. And then let's see. I don't really know. I guess- Years? Well, maybe a couple of years or something. A couple of years. I think we probably came out to California. And then what? Then California.

[00:45:54.190] - Speaker 2
And how did that happen?

[00:45:55.570] - Speaker 1
I don't know. Then part of it is, all right, well, The thing that I think maybe that I left out when I was born, he started playing guitar. So it was probably Venezuela. Raine and River started performing together, and they would go My dad, I think part of the missionary work would be to go into jails and they would perform for inmates. Then they got better, and they had this.

[00:46:26.550] - Speaker 2
But this was doing the missionary work for the group, but then you leave the group, but they continued When you're performing?

[00:46:31.350] - Speaker 1
No, because I think when they left the group, that's when we got on the boat. I think part of what it was with the group was like, your job is to go and pass out pamphlets and get people to join. I think for my parents, it was spreading the word, right? Missionary work.

[00:46:50.150] - Speaker 2
Something they believed in.

[00:46:51.740] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. It was connected to the group, but how much they lived with the group or our lives. I don't have a lot of memories of the group, memories of the family. I don't think my siblings who were outperforming was necessarily connected to the group. I don't think it was a requirement of the thing. I think it was something that my dad and them did because they believed. If you believe in something, you want to spread the word, something good. I think so. And so I guess at some point, I don't know where this came from. I don't know if my parents suggested, I don't know if somebody else suggested it, but they performed in talent shows.

[00:47:30.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Do you remember seeing them perform?

[00:47:34.260] - Speaker 1
I don't. I have memories, but I think it's from newspaper clippings that I saw when I was older or something. That makes sense. I'm not sure. I think that I was young. I do know that there was a point where I wanted to be part of it.

[00:47:46.920] - Speaker 2
You wanted to join the group?

[00:47:47.830] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But that really didn't happen until later. So they would play, and I think they got a lot of notice. It's one of those things. I think it was probably It's probably undeniable that at that young age, they both had something. It is whatever the fuck that is, whatever that means. I think Yeah, I have a memory of my brother being quite young and just owning the guitar. Not a playing a lead way. It's just like a rhythm. He's just a kid who had a guitar that was bigger than him and he fucking owned it. I think it was that thing where you're like, Well, that person, they have found an instrument for expression that is just whatever it is. That was his thing. I think my parents recognized that. My mom had gone to school, maybe, with Penny Marshall. At the time, of course, was in a really successful show, Leverne and Shirley. She wrote her a letter. Would you meet my kids? They seemed to have something, this desire and they're doing this thing. The story is that Penny wrote back and was like, Congratulations, don't come out to LA. I'm sure that Yeah, I can only imagine.

[00:49:31.690] - Speaker 1
Now, if I got a letter like that from somebody who's like, I knew when I was a kid, my kids really want to do something. Can we come out to LA? Will you meet them? You'd be like, you know.

[00:49:41.760] - Speaker 2
What would I do? What am I going to do?

[00:49:43.490] - Speaker 1
What could I even do? You know, my parents, we went to LA anyways.

[00:49:50.020] - Speaker 2
So your family moved to LA chasing a dream?

[00:49:54.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Great. Yeah, or either chasing a dream or being pulled by something. Yeah. Okay? Yeah. I mean, they were right. Right? Yeah, it worked. There was nothing. Nothing was forced. We were fucking living by faith. We had nothing. We had no means. And it worked.

[00:50:17.690] - Speaker 2
And faith came through.

[00:50:19.280] - Speaker 1
I did. So I guess maybe chasing a dream, but part of me also feels like-I didn't mean it in a negative way. No, I know you did. But I'm having my conversation with myself about it and have throughout my life because in some ways it's insane and reckless.

[00:50:38.950] - Speaker 2
It's a wild story. I wouldn't use the word reckless because it's not like they were protecting anything before. It's like maybe they were taking a chance, but I wouldn't use the word reckless.

[00:50:49.600] - Speaker 1
No, you're right. I guess it's really incredible the faith they had and this belief because having kids now myself, the amount of work that I do to try to guarantee that things are going to be smooth with all the means that I have. It's part of me that was like, you are putting yourself into another situation which you did not know the outcome. And now you have even more kids, right? You have a brand new baby. And we're just getting in the car, driving in a car that shouldn't take local roads, and you're on the 10 going west.

[00:51:28.750] - Speaker 2
So you guys drove across the country.

[00:51:30.280] - Speaker 1
We drove across the country. Wow.

[00:51:31.660] - Speaker 2
Any memory of that, being in the car?

[00:51:33.750] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That was where we gave away the dog. The very strong memory is the... It was this old station wagon that you used to have that one window rolled up in the back. That window was broken, right?

[00:51:48.240] - Speaker 2
So open all the time.

[00:51:49.700] - Speaker 1
Open all the time. And at some point it got cold.

[00:51:52.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Would you guys sleep in the car?

[00:51:55.210] - Speaker 1
We'd sleep in the car. Wow. I never questioned this story growing up. And as an adult, I'm questioning how my father came to this conclusion. But it was cold. And the only solution, I think, available to him, I have to imagine available, and all he could think of was to take pampers, diapers, and to stick them together to cover up the back window. But I feel like, wasn't there a tarp? Wasn't there duct tape? How well can a diaper stick? It has to come on, doesn't it? So I have such a vivid memory, so I know that it happened, but it seems insane. It makes no sense. But I have to believe that it must have been the middle of the fucking night and suddenly the weather dropped. It's what you had. And there's no version of we can stop it. And all we have are some diapers. Maybe there's a trash bag and some diapers together. In my mind, it's diapers. Maybe there was something else as well. Maybe the window could only go up halfway or three quarters away and the rest was done with diapers. I don't know. It's funny how those stories that you tell them, you go, I should clarify for myself that you never really wonder about.

[00:53:20.080] - Speaker 1
It's just part of your life. But there were those moments. Again, my dad always being really ingenious with surviving, just making it work.

[00:53:34.930] - Speaker 2
The power of faith is unbelievable.

[00:53:41.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah, completely. And my parents had that.

[00:53:45.630] - Speaker 2
Did you say you have it?

[00:53:47.530] - Speaker 1
I don't know that I do. Yeah.

[00:53:49.700] - Speaker 2
Did you ever have it?

[00:53:52.510] - Speaker 1
Yes, and I think that in some ways I do. I it the way that they did. I don't think that I could... I don't think I could... I mean, my parents, there's a picture of them with four kids hitchhiking, literally hitchhiking. I don't think I could do that.

[00:54:14.930] - Speaker 2
You also don't know because you never had to have that. That's the other thing. It's like they rose to the occasion, and it sounds like in a pretty positive way. It wasn't bad vibes in your house. It wasn't like pity and crying all the time.

[00:54:32.260] - Speaker 1
It was like, let's go. No, the antithesis. No problem. I think that I've always felt purpose connected to something. Maybe I'm just not as comfortable with that language, or maybe it feels like wanting a more, I don't know, a different understanding of it. But I think there I do have a feeling of knowing a certain comfort and a or that the things are moving in a direction and I'm a part of it and I'm okay with that. Yeah.

[00:55:08.640] - Speaker 2
And that was your role in the family, too. So what you're describing, that also makes sense.

[00:55:15.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean, I think that my personality is such, my nature is such. I was very comfortable being the third born and not having any real responsibility. I think that's how I expected my life to go. And I was good with it. I knew that I was going to be an actor from being young at a point when I had already acted and moved away from it. But I didn't think that it would be of value to the family in any way that I thought that it would strictly just be for my own benefit. And my brother was very much, I'd say, the driving force of the family in some ways, even My dad, at this point, when he got older, he'd been so hobbled from his life. I mean, literally just back broke and legs and just from co-accidents from a very young age. So physically Basically, he was somebody that was in pain. My whole life, my dad was in pain. And he dealt with it in a way that his life experience helped him to deal with it, just usually to to numb it with alcohol. It was really the only way that I think he could cope with it.

[00:56:36.720] - Speaker 1
I don't want that to sound too dramatic, and I don't know that it was that dramatic, but I think it's something I would say now. I don't think that he would have said that. I don't know other people would have. I don't know. But I would say that.

[00:56:48.370] - Speaker 2
He was drinking the self-medicate because for him pain.

[00:56:50.860] - Speaker 1
For sure. He was in pain. Who knows what a man's expectations of themselves may be and where he got to. Maybe there was a point where he took the family as far as he could take it, his ingenuity. I imagine it's like the dream that your child is going to take over in some ways, and also probably very difficult to face your mortality. Unless you're preparing your sofa that or you're comfortable doing that. I don't know that my impression of my father at some point was somebody that was hurt. And I don't know what level of hurt that is. I don't know how much of it was physical, how much it was spiritual or emotional. Obviously, somebody definitely had many unresolved things within his own family and life experience. So my brother, I think, was the driving force of the family, and certainly was probably the singular force that took us out of relying on the kind gestures of others to where we suddenly we bought a house. You know what I mean? And so I was very comfortable with that. I think when my brother I died. I think I just turned 18. And I imagine, I know that I felt a certain push to take on some responsibilities for the family in some ways.

[00:58:28.190] - Speaker 1
I can't remember what led me to this. I can't I feel like you asked me that prompted this, but I don't know how it came to that. I guess faith, when you were talking about faith, I had faith. I think at some point maybe that was shook a little bit. And maybe I felt like, I'm going to grab these motherfucking reins and do something. Yeah, I don't... It goes back to one of your earlier questions. I don't know if I was leading that or if I was being pulled. I don't know what that was.

[00:59:04.020] - Speaker 2
Did you feel it as a sense of responsibility? What would be the word for the feeling?

[00:59:11.740] - Speaker 1
Part of it, honestly, part of me wants to say that, but then I think, prior to my brother's death, he was like, Listen, you're going to start acting again. You're going to be really good. You're going to do it. You're You're going to go for it. You're going to fucking do it. You're going to be more of an actor than I am. And so he was like, Listen, I'm doing this movie. You're auditioning for the brother in it. And got me back into this is after I lived in Costa Rica for a few years. I'd stepped away from acting because I was acting as a kid. And I came back, I started actively going to New York and auditioning. I was auditioning to play his part. I think that probably just because he was like, as my brother I wanted to play my brother, I still auditioned for it and we were going to do this movie. So I think in some ways it was already moving in that direction. And then this seismic event happened in my life, which then was like, you know. Now what? Yeah. So it's really interesting looking back on it.

[01:00:23.640] - Speaker 1
It's hard for me to know what thing was coming first.

[01:00:29.240] - Speaker 2
You said that knew you wanted to be an actor from young. You never wanted to do anything else.

[01:00:38.090] - Speaker 1
No, no. No, but I started acting so young. I mean, again, before acting, we were seeing on the streets, and I definitely felt probably alive. I think in some ways, if you were going to psychoanalyze the family dynamics and being the third born, and there was a certain Even though there was faith in the family, there was a time it was chaos. I mean, it's just the fucking nature. I don't know how you have five kids and a dog and not have the means. I seem to remember going out and singing these songs and dancing on the streets and just feeling fucking invincible.

[01:01:24.100] - Speaker 2
It's like-Did it have to do with the reaction or not necessarily?

[01:01:30.320] - Speaker 1
I'm sure because I wasn't going to get the same thing just being with my dad, doing the song in front of him. But it's that unique thing that happens in a situation where you're performing in front of a crowd. It's who's giving who the energy. Who starts it. At some point, it becomes this reciprocal experience. I think that was the first feeling. Then my river started acting. And me and my sister guest-started in a show that he did. And what did it feel like? I don't know how to articulate it. It just felt... I think it was both totally powerful and totally vulnerable simultaneously.

[01:02:18.510] - Speaker 2
You're out there.

[01:02:20.770] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it was just fucking fun. He was eight years old and it was cool running around on a set. And Everyone is so cool. He's eight years old. I mean, the grips the coolest motherfuckers there, man. You got to do this rolling on belts and they got all this gear on. You know what I mean? And it's a weird little circus. It's a cool life. It's interesting. And I would say in their own way, every single person on the set is creative. They are all doing something. And so there is a very powerful energy on a set, even on a mediocre TV show. It's still really amazing. The forces that come together.

[01:03:07.680] - Speaker 2
It's a group effort, for sure.

[01:03:09.340] - Speaker 1
It is. And when you're a kid, you're real sensitive to that shit. You really feel like, well, hold on, there's something happening here that is fucking buzzing. I remember you walk on it, you smell the lights. It all still smells the same. And the sounds of the the trucks that are there, they move in the honey wagons. It's such an eclectic group of people that normally their lives might not intersect. And yet here they are in this unified effort. So there's something that's very attractive and fun about it, I think as a kid, it was part of it.

[01:03:50.570] - Speaker 2
You've gotten to work with probably the greatest living directors. How different is it from director to Are their styles different? Are they similar?

[01:04:04.830] - Speaker 1
Sure. I mean, of course, the styles are different. But at some point, there's one connective tissue, which is just a powerful perceptive quality that allows them to seek out truth in a moment. There are times where you're filming a 3D and you go, That's right. And 90 % of the directors are like, good. Sometimes they're like, wow. And the other 10 %, those special ones. If you ever do something where you think, okay, and you actually feel okay, and somebody's like, it's just heartbreaking and crushing and also so exciting. And you're just like, thank you. Thank you. And what can that be, particularly if you start out from a place of like, Okay, well, here's something. And then you have a partner saying, No, not really.

[01:05:11.140] - Speaker 2
If there's going to be another take, would it more likely be you saying, Let me try it again, or would it be the director saying, Let's do it again?

[01:05:17.050] - Speaker 1
No, it's them.

[01:05:19.180] - Speaker 2
Do you ever say, Let's do it again. I want to try one more time?

[01:05:23.400] - Speaker 1
Very rarely. I'm always struggling with this feeling of, yes, there's something for me to do. I'm being guided by something and just crushing insecurity and fear. It's just so stupid. But part of me is like, what it would take for me to say, I want another one, because then it'd be like, okay, what are you going to do? What are you going to do?

[01:05:56.450] - Speaker 2
It's setting yourself up for asking for another one. A littleThat's interesting.

[01:06:01.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think that by the time we get to the last take, we are locked in, usually. I mean, the filmmaker of what we're after. It's more earlier on as we're talking about things where it's like, and sometimes all I can do is just say, There's something missing.

[01:06:23.080] - Speaker 2
Do you ever change the lines?

[01:06:25.450] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I mean, of course. The best is when you go, I just made up some great shit. And you're like, and then you look at the script and you did exactly what was that. That's the best feeling.

[01:06:38.510] - Speaker 2
Does the person you're playing against impact your performance? Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. Because you're reacting to them.

[01:06:46.510] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, for every reason that's... I mean, there's so many different reasons, right? Yeah, of course. Two actors doing the... Trying to do the exact same thing, you're still going to have a different reaction to just who that person is. Sometimes you're looking at a piece of tape next to the camera and you're talking to that, and you can't even see the other actor.

[01:07:09.360] - Speaker 2
Can you play any character, or do you need to feel a connection to that character to do it?

[01:07:18.070] - Speaker 1
I don't think that I could play any character. I think there's some that are more right for them. I do think you got to be cast. Maybe there are some actors that can do anything. I don't trust them.

[01:07:32.870] - Speaker 2
You have to believe your character. You have to agree with their position. No.

[01:07:40.670] - Speaker 1
You just have to know that You have to know that they do. Yeah. At some point, yes, you have to believe it in that moment. But I guess it's always the trick to try to from observing from a distance to experiencing and presenting as if it's your own. Because if you remain at a distance, if you're laughing at the character or you're going like, I don't, that's not how I feel. But...they don't want to be good. I don't think so. And I think you can sense that sometimes in performances. And I'm sure I've done it. I think the hope is that you are as connected as possible. I don't know.

[01:08:30.820] - Speaker 2
Could you ever imagine not doing it?

[01:08:35.970] - Speaker 1
Yes. I don't know. Maybe not. I've been working a lot the last few years. And I think subconsciously, having a kid probably has a lot to do with that, although I didn't feel like I was making those decisions in the moment. But I knew what I was sacrificing, what I was moving away from in order to do them, and I felt a need to do it. And part of me has been really struggling with several things recently that I think I never regret anything just because the life where I'm sitting in right now, it's hard to ever regret anything. But I don't want to make too much of a thing of what I do, but I feel like in some ways I'd always had a reverence the purest possible form of this entertainment thing that I do. And I always steered clear of being motivated by money or prestige or anything. And it really was pure, not because I'm fucking virtuous or anything, but just I don't know why. It ended up that way. I was fortunate and I benefited from the decision because I had no choice. It was just instinct. I can't take credit for it.

[01:09:57.090] - Speaker 2
No, you had good instincts to do what you felt was worth doing, and you weren't corrupted by any other forces.

[01:10:07.110] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think I knew what it took, and so it mattered so much. Then I think in some ways, I've been in this place of like, Well, maybe I would like to try this, and that might be interesting. Making a choice from a different place versus, I think traditionally it always been, historically it had been, Oh, I must do this, versus like, Oh, that might be interesting. I wonder if I could manage to get this to work. And so I think I ended up in this situation recently with a few different projects where I wasn't completely in it, and I had to be in it. And I was away from my family and kids and a way that has made me now going like, Well, I'm not leaving unless I have to do it.

[01:10:58.280] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the documentary where you flared yourself.

[01:11:01.850] - Speaker 1
Oh, right. I'm still here. I finished Walking the Line. Yeah. Then I did...

[01:11:09.760] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that a little bit first. How did you prepare for that?

[01:11:13.850] - Speaker 1
Right. So, strangely enough, before I was even doing that, my friend James gray, who's a director, was doing it like a documentary, shooting some footage on John and June. And glad he had come out. And for some reason, James He'd call me one day, he said, Do you want to meet Johnny Cash? And I said, Sure. And he said, Well, he's in town staying at a relative's house or a friend or something, and they want to come by. So I went over to have dinner with James and Johnny and June, and his friend or family member. And I remembered that he was very shaky. And he told me how much he liked Gladiator and that he seemed to The impression was that he seemed to really like my character versus the character I think most people liked, which was Russell Crowe's character, who they wanted to emulate. He seemed to really appreciate my character. And we were having dinner and he seemed almost shy in some ways. He was? Yeah, he was just a big, strong guy, right? But he seemed shy and he was frail. He was shaky. He was really shaky. He said, We finished dinner, and he said, Should I play some songs?

[01:12:39.570] - Speaker 1
I was like, No, you don't have to. I felt like I thought that maybe he felt like he had to do that. But I don't think he did feel that way. I think that it's something that he really loved and really loved doing it with June. We went into this other room, we were sitting there and he's quite shaky. I thought, I was so uncomfortable for him. I was like, This is just so painful. Then he picked up the guitar and literally, his body was Perfect. Like, literally, the shaking stopped and he's just strumming. And then and he's looking down and then June comes over and sits down. He's just strumming and he just looks up at her. And it was one of those fucking moments that you can't deny there was an incredibly powerful energy in the room. Something came in there and changed everybody in that moment. And he looked at her and they started singing on the Banks of the River Jordan. Is that the song? It's like a beautiful spiritual. And it was jaw-dropping. The impact of that, and again, he was so rich in feeling history and his own creativity, his purpose, and his shared creativity with June was just fucking unbelievable.

[01:14:10.460] - Speaker 1
And I remember just being shocked by that. I'd never witnessed anything like that. And it was a really powerful moment. And at the time, I did not know that I would be playing him or there was even going to be a movie about him. And I don't think it was that long after. I mean, I think it was maybe a year later or something that James Mangold, the writer-director, sent me the script called Cash at the time. I think it was just like, offered it to me, right?

[01:14:40.450] - Speaker 2
Had you ever played an actual person before?

[01:14:43.830] - Speaker 1
I mean, gladiator is based on actual verse, but no one-No one you met. No, no one that anybody could verify whether what you were doing or not felt accurate. Yeah.

[01:14:55.490] - Speaker 2
Did you have any question about doing it?

[01:15:00.310] - Speaker 1
I think that I had this feeling of, Okay, that's it, of a knowing of that's what the next thing was. Just knowing it. But of course, there's two different sides yourself. There's the human part of you that's terrified, I'm going to be humiliated, I'm going to ruin somebody's thing. This is their life. Who am I to fucking do this?

[01:15:23.540] - Speaker 2
All of that. It seems intimidating.

[01:15:26.260] - Speaker 1
Very. It was.

[01:15:27.540] - Speaker 2
I like that you felt the feeling right from the beginning. This is the thing. This is what.

[01:15:32.130] - Speaker 1
Not like, this is going to be great. No, no, no. It wasn't that feeling.

[01:15:36.070] - Speaker 2
No, no, no. But your instinct was you were going to find a way in to do it.

[01:15:40.970] - Speaker 1
I just knew that it's what I was doing. I just knew that it was happening. I That image. And it wasn't, again, it had nothing to do with like, it's going to work. It just was like, this was the next evolutionary step for me. It was like, here's your next opportunity. And you're either going to keep going until these things stop and then, thank you. I had a bunch of cool experiences. Thank you. And you're done. Or it keeps going. I don't know. I just know that this is the opportunity. Thank you so much. Now I'm fucked. What am I going to do? The first thing I did was work with T-Bone. I said, Fly out to LA.

[01:16:24.380] - Speaker 2
He's great.

[01:16:25.390] - Speaker 1
Got a guitar. Never played a guitar. And Got some lessons, started learning E to A. Got B7, thought I was the fucking shit. I was like, Look out. And so started strumming. I listened to a bunch of recordings that I had of John and just talking and a couple of vocal lessons.

[01:16:56.340] - Speaker 2
Was it obvious that you were going to sing as opposed to lip sync?

[01:16:59.960] - Speaker 1
Well, not to me. But James Mangold felt pretty certain of it. And this was probably 2004 or '05. And so ProTools was in full effect by then, right? So there was, I think, probably the possibility of blending stems and note correction. There's enough tools, I think, where that became more possible than probably it would have been 10 years ago, right? At least where you would go, we don't even know if this guy can do it, but we're going to do it anyways because worse comes to worse, we'll figure it out, right? Yeah. So I think everybody was moving forward of just this Let's go and see where it takes us. And yeah, we just went.

[01:17:50.370] - Speaker 2
Okay, the documentary.

[01:17:52.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think there's just a point in my life, it's all this work. I think in some ways I'd hit that first benchmark in some ways. I think walk the line was a thing. And then it seemed maybe the opportunity to be on that was coming in of like, well, now that you've really made it, here's what you got. And that was disappointing to me because I felt like to make it meant like then they were like, now we're going to offer you these shitty movies for a lot of money. That was the next step up. And I think I was so shocked by that because I think I had this fantasy of like, yeah, it just means that the quality is going to improve. And it wasn't the quality, it was the quantity improved, right? Of what came your way. And then it became even more difficult to make choices. In some ways, I, antiquated notion of rebellion kicked in of like, I'm just going to do a smaller movie. Fuck you, I'm going to do a smaller movie. That's also its own ego trip in some ways. I think I felt a little Oh, what am I moving towards?

[01:19:03.070] - Speaker 1
I don't know. It was the first time that I think I was feeling unsure. A little bit like this image of this movie, district 9. I don't know if you ever saw it, like the South African alien movie. But there's just one point where there's aliens on Earth. It's like, Oh, my God, the aliens have come. But it's not like aliens I've ever seen any other movies. It's just like one's just sitting, just pissing, like out in the open, right? And I, I think, was thinking of myself as like, it's that weird thing where you become self-aware in a new way and you reject that idea, yet you also realize that you've had a hand in creating that idea and that persona. And so it's like this thing where you're like, Am I a part of creating this thing, or was it created for me? What the fuck is happening? I'm not feeling good about this. This isn't where things have been leading me.

[01:20:08.500] - Speaker 2
You worked hard for a long time to get to that place to then feel like, Is this it? Yeah.

[01:20:18.150] - Speaker 1
I'm not going to grow at all doing any of these options. Yeah.

[01:20:23.280] - Speaker 2
Is that usually the thing? Is it looking for growth, looking for something that you're looking for-Yeah. Yeah.

[01:20:29.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah, absolutely.

[01:20:31.230] - Speaker 2
Do you feel like your work is therapeutic for you at all? Of course.

[01:20:35.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, yeah. And it's also just fun. It's everything, right? There are points where it feels more vital than There's times in your life where you're like, this is the fucking turning point. Either I have restrictions to put on me, I create my own restrictions or liberations, or whatever it may be to go to that next experience. And I don't know what it's going to require, but something has to give in some way here. I think part of it was Casey, who directed Casey Affleck, who directed the movie, would joke about, we're going to retire, thing. Of course, I'm like 32 years old, I'm not going to retire. It's ridiculous. But in that joke was also this threat to yourself. I think in looking at it now, I'm going, I'm going like, I'm going to put myself out of my misery, put the world out of my misery. If something doesn't change, because what's the point? And maybe that's just a story we tell ourselves to change. Maybe we do grow from it. I don't know. But that's the story you're telling yourself. I'm not moving. And if I don't fucking move, then fuck it.

[01:21:48.490] - Speaker 1
I'm not sure what stage these things came in these ideas, but I remember thinking a lot about being so jealous that Seinfeld, Ellen, all of these people that have these TV they play some versions themselves. And why they could do it as a sitcom. I was like, What if you did it, but you made it like it wasn't a joke? You made it serious. And there's somebody that just, I don't know, was tantrumizing about that idea. It was like, it excited me.

[01:22:16.950] - Speaker 2
It's really exciting.

[01:22:18.660] - Speaker 1
And I thought it was dangerous. It is. And then with my friend, I did a fake interview where I was being interviewed saying that I fired my agent. And there's something about just saying that, doing this fake interview, that it was just super exciting. But I made the mistake of... Sometimes in a new idea in the liberation, you fall in love with the idea in yourself a little bit and you become cute. And somehow there was some part of me that was still there that was like, You can't do this. You're you're not good enough to do this, and you need some outside support. And I remember telling Casey about it. One of the smartest guys I know, just one of those people that just understands every genre of film. And she was my friend, and it seemed like a fun thing to do. At that point, I don't know that it was like, this is going to be feature length or what it's going to be.

[01:23:26.610] - Speaker 2
Just the concept.

[01:23:27.990] - Speaker 1
Concept, yeah. It He was excited me, and I told him about it. And I think that he was not convinced, and I think he saw that there wasn't enough there. Luckily, I wasn't thinking that. I just had this belief in this feeling right? Yeah. And he reluctantly would come over to my house and do some interviews and film. And I knew he just always was a little bit disappointed and felt like it wasn't something there. But one night, he had invited Gus Van Sant over under the pretense of listening to some songs, some rap songs that I had done. And Gus came over. And I think what happened, I think this was what was genius, whether Casey was aware of it or not, in getting Gus to come over. Gus was somebody I had a long history with. He directed my brother in films. He directed me in the film where I started acting again as an adult, 19 years old. There was a lot of history there. And suddenly, when I'm to play him these songs, I'm genuinely scared and embarrassed. Like, is Gus going to think I'm fucking crazy? These were my feelings were emerging.

[01:24:43.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And so it suddenly successfully took this outlandish crazy idea and then rooted it in real feeling and in my own insecurity and fear. And we played these songs, and then in that fear, I then had to answer him as if I had a belief in this that I was doing. And these songs were fucking ridiculous. I'm playing him. He's very poorly written rap songs. But I have to say to him, Yeah, this is what I'm doing. I'm quitting acting to do this with sincerity. And that was more- Were you able to do it? Well, I think there were brief moments. I see. And there were enough moments where Casey was like, Okay, there's something here. And I think part of it is just in seeing me struggle to keep a straight face, to convince myself that this thing that I'm doing was worth doing when I knew that it wasn't. And I think that's what the character of Waukeen would be experiencing, right? Where the character of Waukeen is going, Hey, look, this thing that I've done, I've built, I've created this thing. I don't want this anymore. I'm doing this other thing. Am I doing this?

[01:26:04.630] - Speaker 1
Is there anything here? And it was enough to constantly be on that edge. And really, what we found was, and the reason why we kept it a secret and really presented it as a legit documentary was really just because any time that I would do a scene with somebody that knew that it wasn't real, one of our friends or something, for the first four months, six months that we filmed, I would just turn it into a joke because I was too embarrassed to actually commit to it. And at some point, I think really through cases encouragement, It was like, I'm not telling people. You're not telling them that.

[01:26:47.860] - Speaker 2
That's what makes it so great. Yeah. That's the magic of it.

[01:26:51.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah, absolutely. For sure. And it's what made- Otherwise, it would be spinal tap, which it's not. That's right.

[01:27:00.250] - Speaker 2
It's some new thing, but also rooted in maybe Andy Kaufman, who would do performance art.

[01:27:06.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I wasn't familiar with Andy.

[01:27:10.360] - Speaker 2
You wouldn't know where the line was.

[01:27:12.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean, years later, when I learned about Andy, yes, I think there were some similarities, but maybe. I don't know. I don't know enough.

[01:27:18.300] - Speaker 2
I also like pro-wrestling for the same reason. You don't know. You're told it's fake, but there are guys killing each other. Right. Sometimes they really hate each other. Yeah. But you don't know.

[01:27:30.060] - Speaker 1
No. I mean, there were times where it was fun. I mean, mostly I remember it being uncomfortable. And I don't like lying to me. I just don't. And there was a moment when it got outside of our little world that we created and we went public. And I had never invited attention into my life in an active way. I'd been a part of publicity for the movie. You're a private person. But this I put myself out there as myself doing some outlandish shit around people that I genuinely admire. And that all I want is for them to think like I'm a decent person. It's so wild. And that was so difficult, and it was really important. It was really important to go like...

[01:28:21.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:28:22.940] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So people hate you. And like, okay, how do I live with that? And it taught a lot about acting. It was really my first experience where I was doing something that was probably as close to live as I might ever get, right? Because there were some things. I did a show in Vegas. I did a show in Miami. We did this show in Miami, and we set up this guy to heckle me that I should fight with. It's when a Casey's I just meet him for a second before we go out there. He's like, Here's the news. You know he's going to be stage right. And so I get up on fucking stage. It's like a club, but it's fucking huge to me. And start doing this song. I cannot remember the words. I don't know what is happening. And I'm looking at I go, Where is this dude? It's all dark. It's dark. The lights are flashing. And I just know that there's people. And at this point, it had been public enough to where people are actively, openly, mocking me. They're wearing disguises like me. I think even- people dressed as you?

[01:29:43.030] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:29:43.510] - Speaker 2
That's amazing.

[01:29:44.280] - Speaker 1
It was like a fake beard. The beard.

[01:29:48.110] - Speaker 2
Sun glasses.

[01:29:49.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I was like, I'm private, I'm insecure, I'm scared, I would rather not be thought of. It was shocking. It was put out there. Then I just knew the time in the song when I was supposed to be heckled that I couldn't fucking hear shit. So I just start talking back, start talking to this crowd, screaming this person. I can't even see them. And then I just fucking decide I'm going to fucking jump into the audience. And as I'm running, jumping off the stage, I see the guy, luckily, because he was. He was just stage right where he was supposed to be. And I jumped in the crowd and fucking grabbing him. And we I pulled apart and fucking the bouncer are there and they yank us up. They pulled me in. And I was so fucking jacked up just with the adrenaline that I just started vomiting. They lead me into this bathroom. And I was sick. And it was like, Well, this is just about the coolest experience I've ever had in my life. That's it.

[01:30:53.480] - Speaker 2
That's next level. That's next level.

[01:30:56.460] - Speaker 1
That is a feeling. It's that extreme version, right? Because you want to have, yeah, it's pro-wrestling. You want to have that extreme feeling. I've had powerful feelings in a more subtle, different way. And I'll never have that again, I don't think, because it was an idea. It was a time. It was just when online entertainment was accessible and there was a need for content. I think it happened five years before, it wouldn't have made much noise. It just was like, it was the first time that in that period where things were going as viral as they could go. It goes viral for you. The whole world isn't aware of it, but there's enough where it can spin around in its own circle. And so at some point we're like, again, created this thing, had this idea, and then we're being pulled by the gravitation of it. I certainly quickly became a passenger in this thing. I think in some ways, it's something that I have repeated in some form. From the beginning of my life, there was that, you asked me a question earlier, are you driving? Are you being pulled?

[01:32:22.950] - Speaker 2
I think that-So you started by driving, but then very quickly got swept up in this thing.

[01:32:27.860] - Speaker 1
And that has been the goal ever since. That movie really taught me the value of that.

[01:32:37.880] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the Letterman appearance. I remember seeing it and just being stunned in a way that made me more curious, wanting to know more.

[01:32:46.620] - Speaker 1
Yeah, well, it just so happened. Again, we didn't intend for the filming of this project to go on so long. We didn't know when we started what it was going to do. It just so happened that it It took me a few months before I really gave myself into it. I actually really found the character, what he, I was going to be. And then it's what happened that I had a film coming out and I had to promote it. I didn't know what to do because at this point, it had been public that I was retiring, that I was doing a record, that I was going to get my record produced. I couldn't break character.

[01:33:31.620] - Speaker 2
It's amazing. That wasn't a pre-planned thing, but it turned into a great opportunity.

[01:33:37.430] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Casey was like, Go on letterman. You're going to have to do it because what choice do we have? I was like, right. I go in, I'm first doing a junket for a film. To be honest, it's one of James' films. It was a Two Lovers. It was called. It was a small I love James. I've worked with him forever. I couldn't talk about this film in a real way, in a quote, unquote normal way because I was maintaining-It seems like most it might have been better. It feels like-I don't know if it was better for James's film.

[01:34:15.140] - Speaker 2
But whatever you did created enough interest where you want to know what this person is doing. For sure.

[01:34:22.820] - Speaker 1
I don't know. But it was something where, again, suddenly I'm a passenger here. You a pre-interview with the producer of Letterman's show, and I maintained character, right?In.

[01:34:37.650] - Speaker 2
The pre-interview as well?In the pre-interview. Always.

[01:34:39.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I said, This is what I'm doing. He said, Yeah, I'm putting this record. I can't remember what it was. I hung up and I was like, I admire Dave too much. That guy was like the guy for me. I have way too much respect. I think it'd be foolish to think that I could pull the wall because I don't think I could... Maybe the bar also was like, I'll never convince him. But more than I said, Keith, I know that we have this fucking agreement to never let anybody know. I had to let him know. I just think I'm not going to do it to him. So I called the producer back and I said, Hey, listen, this is the project I'm doing. No, this is real. But I hope it's okay. I'm not trying to make you guys look stupid. I want Dave to lacerate me. I said, Just you can do whatever you want. Because I didn't want them to think like I was coming out to try to make them look stupid. Because there were enough people that were saying, Is this real? Is he trying to take the piss out of us?

[01:35:45.640] - Speaker 1
And they said, well, I'm not telling Dave because it's a legal thing. If I did something outlandish and somebody got hurt, they couldn't say they it. I see. There's no way they didn't tell him something, right? Because if he ever found out-Did you ever talk to him about it after? No, just without, no. So I went on the show and I didn't know what... I didn't know what I was going to do. I didn't know what was going to happen. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever done in my life because I think there were a couple of moments where I probably, again, this is where my experience and the character's experience line up, which is, I don't think I want to do this anymore. I think I might have made a mistake, and I don't think I want to do this. And that's what the character would be experiencing at the time. And so the project that I created, that I was doing, the character had created this project they were doing, and we both are going, I think we might have taken this too far. And so it had a real energy to it there.

[01:37:01.470] - Speaker 1
It wasn't me sitting back going like, Fuck all these people. I'm doing this thing. And it wasn't...

[01:37:09.870] - Speaker 2
No, it was palpable. Yeah, it was like- It's so funny.

[01:37:15.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because it's so uncomfortable.

[01:37:18.460] - Speaker 2
So uncomfortable. It's unbelievable.

[01:37:21.930] - Speaker 1
The chewing the gum.

[01:37:25.980] - Speaker 2
And that all was... None of that was planned. No, and it wasn't.

[01:37:30.270] - Speaker 1
It was so funny. When I looked back at it, I go like, Yeah, what did you go out on the chewing gum? I didn't even... I just...

[01:37:41.070] - Speaker 2
I figured-The fact that he called you out for chewing gum is so funny. And then your reaction was incredible.

[01:37:49.140] - Speaker 1
I mean, he was just on fire.

[01:37:51.870] - Speaker 2
He was really funny. Oh, my God. He was funny.

[01:37:54.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, it was a very weird mixture of emotion because I was thinking like, we're cutting on Leverman, and he's fucking lacering me. We've been dreaming about public humiliation for the character. That was our goal. It was peak. It was perfect. It was like, it's happening. It was like, but I don't want it.

[01:38:18.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't want this. I don't like it.

[01:38:20.660] - Speaker 1
I don't want it. But also, oh, I can't believe we're fucking doing it. We did it. Yes, we did it.

[01:38:26.340] - Speaker 2
There must be some aspect of freedom about it.

[01:38:30.800] - Speaker 1
Well, yeah, it was certainly the death of the public, in some ways, the real me and a thing that I had, again, back to, I think some of this happens inadvertently, but that we create this persona that we're a part of it. And the only thing that was authentic was that there was a person that was like, I'm trying to do something, and I'm also just really He's fucking scared, and I don't want it to happen anymore. And there was something pure in that moment that revealed a true nature. And yeah, that was an epiphany. I mean, that was an incredibly powerful feeling. And it was like, well, yeah, that's really the only thing worth going for. The like, I've created a character. I've developed it. I'm staying in my character. I'm doing it. I'm affecting you. I hit my mark. I say my line, people cry I get an award. All of that was just fucking meaningless. It was like all of that thing that I thought was my goal from when I started out young, it became crystal clear that that just was meaningless compared to this moment in which a true nature was revealed, that the experience of this person was revealed.

[01:39:57.160] - Speaker 1
And through character, that was revealed. And it was like, well, of course, that's the fucking goal. Everything else is just noise and unimportant.

[01:40:07.510] - Speaker 2
There's a speech you give in the beginning of the movie where you're standing outside, you got a hood on, and It's everything you say is true. You're saying all true things about what you don't like about your job. It's really smart in that it walks that line of, yes, it's a character, yes, it's fake, and everything he's saying is true.

[01:40:38.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because these are things that I know that I've said pieces of in interviews or my friends had. We were aware of ourselves and each other. It was that moment where you've done it long enough, where you no longer are just doing press, what's happening? You're like, oh, I've said these things I've repeated these stories. My friend says this. I see them desperately wanting that. But saying that, but saying that. You just become... It was like the age that I was at. I could see also the part of me that is bullshit. And so I could take those things and use them and know that I've said it or I've seen my friends say it in a way and that I just was basically repeating that and copying that. But yeah, that was a key moment, that scene. I remember filming that where it was like, oh, now we're getting into a strange area And I can't fully articulate what this is. But again, there's something that feels that it's revealing and giving myself over. But honestly, the truth is, if it wasn't for Casey and that partnership, I wouldn't have gotten there on my own.

[01:42:05.980] - Speaker 1
I wouldn't have. I wasn't willing to take it public. I was too scared. And he saw the value. He was like, You have the idea, but you don't have the fucking guts or whatever it may be to really... You want to crush your ego, but you're fucking too scared to really do it. And I don't know if he would have articulated it like that, but in some ways, that's what it was. I created this thing that was saying, all of this is fucking bullshit and everything that I've done. And the only value is to just decimate it. But I wasn't really willing to... I can only do that in a winking, laughing way. You guys see that I'm making fun of myself, right? Not like, you guys see that I am, actually, I am actually... I am full of shit. This is all fucking… It was like…

[01:43:03.610] - Speaker 2
How has that impacted everything since?

[01:43:06.980] - Speaker 1
First of all, I had succeeded in the way that I didn't want to, which was I had actually destroyed my career. It was a fear. To feel the effects of it for real were surprising because I was an up and coming actor that I think…

[01:43:23.010] - Speaker 2
So it really did change in real life?

[01:43:25.070] - Speaker 1
Oh, God, yeah.

[01:43:26.520] - Speaker 2
I had no idea.

[01:43:27.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah, because we He'd so successfully played with reality where nobody knew anymore. My agent, who I told a year and a half prior and did an interview with him, was like, by the end, was like, Is this for real? We'd gone so deep. And I think when it got so public, I think the feeling was, even if this started out as a joke, even if he's playing crazy, he's actually He's actually legitimately crazy because he's doing it. And so no matter what, he's got fucking problems. No matter what, there's some stink on his fucking name right now that is not-So perception became reality. Yeah, completely. I mean, it was for a year, I was this fucking joke. How would you expect me to be? What movie am I going to be in where you're going to take me What are you going to do? So we were, this is embarrassing to admit, but I think that we were convinced that we had a real shot at making some money on this. And it turns out that it basically bankrupt us. I mean, we paid for it all of ourselves and it wasn't very expensive.

[01:44:53.990] - Speaker 1
But I wasn't wealthy at the time. I'm wealthy comparatively, but I hadn't paid off my house, and I was trying to get the mortgage. So there was a point where I was like, Oh, man, I'm fucked. And so began the process of trying to work again. And also the first time going like, I got to rebuild this thing. This thing I wanted to... You got to build something. Thank God. But I also feel like a slight desperation that I'd never felt before because as much as I was always building something, I always had the support and good graces of people around me. Which would burn. It's just completely. Burned every bridge. Completely. And so it was like, oh, shit. So the first time I was really going to the rooms back to when I was a kid being like, Hey, please, can you... Hey, can I? And I remembered that one of the only One of the only options I had was just, I won't say the movie, but just a terrible movie. And I was like, I got to... You got to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.

[01:46:12.270] - Speaker 1
And I just was like, But all that. All that? I just was like, No. I don't know what I thought, but I didn't think it was going to be like that. And I have to say, I have to give credit because I think a lot of times, agents will get a bad rap, and probably for good reason and shit. But I had recently started working in with this guy, Boomer Malkin, who's a WME agent. He was Patrick Whitesoul's assistant, who I always dismissed as the assistant, and you're going to try and pwn them off from me, whatever. And in this moment of real desperation, I was offered real money, more money than I should have been offered, considering. And I never felt like I'd relied on anybody about decisions, but I was broken. I was fucking scared. I remember talking to Boomer and I was like, Dude, I literally don't. I've never been into this. I don't know what to do. And he was like, Do you have to do the movie? I said, What do you mean? He said, Does it matter? I was like, at least it doesn't matter. I was like, no.

[01:47:21.550] - Speaker 1
He's like, well, then you shouldn't. And for somebody whose job is to collect 10 % off of you looking at a real paycheck after you've destroyed your fucking career. I think if the higher-ups knew that he gave me that advice, he would have been fucking candid. I was pretty bold. And I really needed that at the time. And I was like, thank you. And I'm fucking locked in again. I was like, in that moment, I was like, okay, boom, done. I'm not after anything. This is where we are. We know it's going to find us. And not long after, Amanda Demi reached out to me saying, Hey, Paul Thomas-Henderson wants your number. And I yelled, of course. And Paul sent me the script, which was this movie, The Master. And so that was the first-So The Master was the first movie after that?

[01:48:10.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Wow. And that was a great one.

[01:48:13.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And that was like I don't deserve that. After what I've done.Wow..

[01:48:19.540] - Speaker 2
You know what I mean? It turns out you did.

[01:48:21.210] - Speaker 1
I certainly went through the lows of everything is fucked. And then I was...

[01:48:33.090] - Speaker 2
That's a happy ending to that story.

[01:48:35.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, sure. That's amazing. Sure is.

[01:48:38.740] - Speaker 2
And then since then, what happened?

[01:48:42.350] - Speaker 1
The master then became a total emersion, but in a more classical form, I guess. I wouldn't know how to... This is not my language. But the proper filmmaking, and not to say that... What we did was a wild experimental thing with video cameras running around, right? And this was 70 millimeter. And it was this scale in some ways. And the scale of the emotion and the experience between Paul and Philip Seymour Hoffmann and myself that I experienced those two films and the experiences of my-Yeah, and back to back. Yeah. And In some ways, Paul is such a high level that, to be honest, working on that movie felt like I was making absolutely here in that I was just navigating this world in this character. And I, at some point, was a passenger. These things started to emerge, and he encouraged and allowed and sculpted. And what happened in that film, that experience, is it made me go like, okay, well, with a director like Paul, you go all in because there's like... I haven't seen the movie. I haven't really know what... I haven't seen it in years. And I don't know what it is, but I do know that there are many scenes in there that are some of the most poorly acted scenes I've ever committed to film.

[01:50:26.860] - Speaker 1
Bad, over-the-top character stuff. Paul, I don't remember him ever directly saying no. I think he just went around. He just avoided your shit and found those moments, that where you are connected with another person, right? And there was something with... I had such a deep, instant love and trust in both Paul and Philip.

[01:50:54.740] - Speaker 2
Do you think you're the same actor you were before the documentary, or did that actually change how you do what you do?

[01:51:05.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, of course it changed. And then the master, I think, some of what I experienced during I'm Still Here, the idea of a real experience in the moment, which I've had previously in other films. I think I'm Still Here allowed me to look, I could publicly humiliated myself. It couldn't be any worse. And so in that was a liberation. And I then accepted that that was going to be a part of my process, and I welcomed it, but I knew that that was going to be a part of it. And I was going to do things that if I stepped out of it, we're going to be so embarrassing to think about that it would derail whatever was happening, that I had to just stay in it and stay in the fucking pain or the discomfort or the ugliness, and yes, the joy of moments.

[01:52:00.530] - Speaker 2
Do you take the characters home with you at night?

[01:52:05.250] - Speaker 1
Consciously, no. I did find on the master, there was... Some of the physicality was so extreme that, again, there were moments where it fell apart for whatever reason. Maybe you're five weeks in and you're feeling a bit more comfortable, and then you talk with somebody on set, and then the next moment, it's gone. And all it is, is that you're looking at yourself like you're away, and it's so scary and painful. And so it was like, I have to stay here just because I'll laugh at myself. I'll just be fucking stupid. What am I doing?

[01:52:44.320] - Speaker 2
In the documentary, would you say that was the most committed you've ever been to a character?

[01:52:50.840] - Speaker 1
No, it was just it was the longest. It just went on. It was four fucking years.

[01:52:55.870] - Speaker 2
Because it was beyond the shooting. You did it everywhere you went for a period of time.

[01:53:03.000] - Speaker 1
You lived it, yes or no? Yeah, I mean, I mostly just, when we were shooting, I just didn't go out because it was like, I don't want to have to see anybody. I don't want to explain this. I just didn't talk to my friends because it was too uncomfortable. I didn't want to lie. So there were a couple times when it was uncomfortable.

[01:53:23.630] - Speaker 2
From the time you start shooting, do the characters continue to change, or do you have the picture from the beginning?

[01:53:31.960] - Speaker 1
Oh, no. My experience is like, it's three weeks before there's anything really worthwhile here. But oftentimes, you don't have that luxury. So it depends. I mean, there are things that you just know some parts of it. I knew on the master, I knew that there was something with his mouth on the right side. I knew he couldn't open his mouth. I didn't totally understand what it was. I knew it enough to where I went to my dentist and he glued these brackets on my teeth and I wrapped rubber bands on them so I couldn't open my mouth because I knew that. But at some point, I was so locked into it that I took the rubber bands off because-And you still were there. That's it. My jaw was locked. I didn't know why. I could have easily, two weeks in, been like, I can't, now this is wrong. It just wasIt was an instinct.

[01:54:30.460] - Speaker 2
How long was it after the film before you got back use of your jaw?

[01:54:34.940] - Speaker 1
It was probably pretty quick. Really? Yeah. I think it's like if you just were like, I'm holding my hands like this, and you just did that, You just do it, but pretty quickly, I think you'd come back. A lot of that character was just tensing muscle. It literally was just a physical state of making things tense so that it just was coiled. And it just held that. And then you stop tensing.

[01:55:08.370] - Speaker 2
I think sometimes through habit, when you do things for a while, your body gets used to doing it that way, and then it's hard to stop.

[01:55:17.980] - Speaker 1
I mean, to be honest, I don't really remember. I mean, the thing that I remember is we wrapped that fucking movie. I had just bags of chips and cookies and shit that I had fucking ordered in advance waiting for me at my house because I wasn't eating for months. And I went home and I laid in bed. I don't think I left my bed for weeks, and I think I just sat there just eating. I literally just ate cookies and watched TV and I didn't see anybody. And I think that I was just like, what is my life? I just was reduced to an organism that was just trying to eat, consume energy. And that's really all I remember about following that movie. So I don't know what the process was, but I don't think it was anything that dramatic.

[01:56:13.470] - Speaker 2
When you got offered the Joker, was it obvious that you wanted to do it?

[01:56:17.740] - Speaker 1
No. First, I liked Todd, the director, Todd Phillips.

[01:56:21.800] - Speaker 2
Had you worked with him before or no? I hadn't.

[01:56:26.550] - Speaker 1
And the script's very well written. It was a great script. And it had this unbelievable ending. It's like last act that was really shocking. To me, it was a big movie. It was like 55 million, which I think to Todd was a small movie. But to me, It was a big movie. It was what they call IP. It was this thing, and I'd never done that. I felt like, but it was a one-off. It was not going to be... It wasn't in Any contract for a sequel. And Todd seemed so curious. And he just kept telling me that we were going to be able to do what we wanted, that there was no expectation. There was no studio expectation, really, that he was in control. And he had built a schedule that was going to allow us to play, to try things. And I was like, well, that is just like, all I want to do is try things, and I never really have the resources. And it's really hard to turn that down. But I still was very unsure, and I struggled with it for months and months. My wife, Rooney, was at some point, she was like, you're doing this.

[01:57:48.910] - Speaker 1
Not like, I'm telling you, but she had a knowing. This is going to be what you do next, but go through your process. Todd says as a joke, but it's true that I never agreed to it, and I was already shooting, and I still hadn't said that I was doing it. It was still a possibility. I understand.

[01:58:08.150] - Speaker 2
Did he ever tell you why he wanted you to do it?

[01:58:12.690] - Speaker 1
No. Actually, I remember I talked to Chris Nolan about the Dark Knight, and that wasn't going to happen for whatever reason. I think that I wasn't ready then. And that's one of those things, right? Sometimes where you could Why am I not doing this? What does he mean, it's not doing it? And somebody goes, It's because it's not about me. There's something else. There's another person that's going to do something that is like, I can't imagine what it would be if we didn't have Head Ledger's performance in that film, right? And I don't know whether Christopher No one was coming to me saying, You are definitely the person. I can't remember the context of how we met, but I know that we met. And my The feeling was, I shouldn't do this, but maybe he also was like, You're not the guy. I couldn't say.

[01:59:06.180] - Speaker 2
But it went the way it was supposed to go. Absolutely. And in this case, too.

[01:59:10.210] - Speaker 1
I guess so. And it, true to his word, Kaa really allowed us to play. I mean, the first two weeks, maybe it was even three weeks. Three weeks sounds insane. That's why I'm questioning it. But it really might have been. There's very little the first three weeks in the movie. And I was doing a character that was an idea that I had with this certain physicality that Todd and I talked about, and we were doing it. And there was a part of me that was like, I don't, I'm not sure about this. And I've had that feeling with almost everything I've done, right? Yeah. And one weekend, Todd and I went into the editing suite and watched footage of the three weeks. Actually, to her credit, I asked Rui to come in also because I was like, Am I crazy? But Todd and I, and certainly with Rui's encouragement, I think we looked each other. It's that thing where you know it's hard to admit to each other. But we both have been pursuing this thing going down a road that isn't right, and it's contrived. And that was probably the most painful version I've ever had of that in my life.

[02:00:37.760] - Speaker 1
Like, holy fucking shit. I've had the embarrassment of a couple of scenes, but this is weeks of work. In some ways, we had the time, and I think that in some ways, Todd and I knew just from talking that there was something more between us, even though we couldn't say specifically right then. There were some things that were good or interesting about it, or at least felt different, but it wasn't real. We changed the way that I wore the costumes, the change of hair and makeup and changed the acting, radically. And that was a wild experience, dude. It was wild because it was like my first studio movie in a long, fucking time. So I was making these $20 million movies. And so I felt this pressure. It's like, oh, shit, it's a studio thing. And they've paid me some. And this is this beloved fucking character in the world. And I'm just lost. And I'm just terrible. And Todd was just like, bro, I love you, dude. You're fine. We're going to do this. We're going to be okay. I was like, How the fuck could he be saying this? Does he not see how bad this is?

[02:02:05.310] - Speaker 1
And he saw there was something more going on. He was somehow was able to just bat that to the side. I was going like, Dude, this is the fucking end. Sometimes you got to look up and you're like, Blindfold's on. There's going to be a fucking rifle shot going off, and that's it. All right? So just fucking take it like a man. This is that moment, right? I fucked up. You fucked up. You got the wrong person. We're going down. And he was like, no, no way. He was like, No, you're good. Let's just go add it. We got the time. It doesn't matter. Let's change it. Let's work on it. It's okay. So we did. And in that process, again, was a death of the ego and a death of your ideas, the death of your fantasies of like, God damn, I am fucking good. I'm fucking good. That's a good idea. I admit, I'm ashamed, but I have had, no matter how many times I go through it, I still have those moments where I go like, It's a good fucking idea. That's going to be good. And went in there with a fixed fucking idea.

[02:03:18.600] - Speaker 1
And I stopped having reverence for the thing, and I stopped having gratitude. And I stopped saying thank you. And I stopped saying, I'm along for the ride. I was like, Here's the thing. I started like this. I do this. A little bit back to the fucking release story from Gladiator. It's just all that same thing that I have to keep going through. Again, I can't allow myself to be in the business of the outcome and what happens. But I know the difference between the first three weeks and the following several weeks where it's not my place to say what's good or not, but of like, I'm in an experience. I'm no longer controlling things. I'm reacting. And then to have that on that scale and to be able to have the resources to reshoot things, to alter moments, to go back, that was special. That was super valuable. Then never had that before.

[02:04:19.880] - Speaker 2
That's amazing.
