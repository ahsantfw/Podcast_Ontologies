[00:00:09.060] - Speaker 3
Tell me about doing gigs with Peter and Gordon, just what the world was like then.

[00:00:27.660] - Speaker 1
Well, the beginning would have been us walking into coffee bars and stuff and saying, Do you ever have entertainment? Or spotting one that did and saying, Can we do one night for nothing? And you see if you like us. We did a couple of pubs, coffee bars, a place called Tina's Bar. We used to do at lunchtime. At lunchtime? Lunchtime. Amazing. We had a lunchtime gig, and we would get a free meal and a free pint of beer and a pound each, which was a pretty good deal. We kept all of it. That was the difference. Then eventually, of course, post Peter and Gordon, a post hit record, you'd be playing all kinds of places. In England, suddenly you'd be on package tours, same as America, but not as exciting.

[00:01:12.780] - Speaker 2
How long would a set be on a package tour?15.

[00:01:15.080] - Speaker 1
Minutes, 20 minutes. Wow.

[00:01:17.320] - Speaker 2
So three or four songs.

[00:01:18.700] - Speaker 1
Three or four songs. Well, they varied because when we were like the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars, which was a big one, is memorable. A lot of acts on the bill The one we found a poster of one, we were actually a headliner, which was ephemeral because it was usually who had the biggest hit that week. It was us, Tom Jones, who was probably on his first single. We were probably on a second hit or something, which is why we were headlining The Sherrells, who we were in awe of, of course, and Brian Highland, Ronny Dove. What's his name? Hold Me Thrill Me, Kiss Me. Mel Carter, people like that. We're all on the same show, which is fantastic. All crammed in. Then the most drastic were the Mourre the K shows in New York, where you do five shows a day, but you only do one song or Or two, if you're big, we did two. We were co-headlining with Wilson Picket. Incredible. Which was amazing because you had a mixed audience. We would close the daytime shows, and he would close the nighttime shows. It was amazing. We were so excited, of course.

[00:02:31.350] - Speaker 1
These were our heroes. Someone said, Wilson Picket wants to say hello. It was like, Oh, my God. You go up there and he's sitting in this throne thing with a big entourage. Of course, according to me, it was just our roadie who came from Yorkshire and no thrones and no entourage. We went, That's how it's done.

[00:02:54.150] - Speaker 2
Would you have been about the same age?

[00:02:56.730] - Speaker 1
As Wilson Picket? I wonder. Probably. Yeah. I don't really know.

[00:03:01.620] - Speaker 2
Everybody's kids at this time. Would you say everyone had kids?

[00:03:04.400] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, totally. I mean, our first record came out in '64, so I was 20. But all the pre-record release stuff was all '17, '18, '19, because we met at school. And the weird part was, of course, that suddenly they were putting us ahead of the jurels on these bills. Of course, for us, America was the real thing. We were all fake. The The weirdest part about the whole business is that we created all these fakes in our mind. I mean, pretty good fakes, but sold them all back to the original people.

[00:03:39.780] - Speaker 2
That was the British invasion.

[00:03:41.120] - Speaker 1
The British invasion. I remember we were playing Denver one time Red Rocks, some big Bill in Red Rocks. It wasn't until we got there, because one of the things we were most excited about was that Chuck Berry was on the Bill. We'd never seen him live. Or maybe we'd seen him, might have seen him actually on a tour in England. But certainly, anyway, there we are arriving and we discovered that we are the headliners.Unbelievable.We went, No, you got this all wrong. You invented this music and he invented most of it. We were making all this fuss saying, We please don't make us close the show after Chuck Berry. Of course, it turned out Chuck Berry didn't give a shit. Chuck Berry wanted to get home early. He didn't want to close the show, and we had to do it because without his cooperation, obviously, we couldn't force him to close. That's where he went, Oh, so that's the way it is. He just wanted to get paid.

[00:04:36.540] - Speaker 2
Did you get to meet all these people? Yes. Amazing.

[00:04:40.300] - Speaker 1
We did, briefly.

[00:04:41.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but any lasting impression from any of the people that you met over the years that were just interesting people? What was Chuck like?

[00:04:50.110] - Speaker 1
Abrupt, short.

[00:04:52.580] - Speaker 2
It was business. It was business. Yes.

[00:04:55.110] - Speaker 1
But he was friendly. He wasn't unfriendly. I think he knew who we were. He knew we were on the bill, and he knew we had hit record and stuff. The weirdest one probably was when I went to a jazz club to see Roland Kirk. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. There was another weird thing. In London, I had all my copies of Downbeat already marked with the clubs I wanted to go to, and I knew who was playing. This was such a big deal to us. When we went into these clubs, Of course, I remember it was Bob Brookmire and Stan Getz. For me, it was such a big deal. But we walked in and there were people that everyone's talking and drinking. This music is… I went, Oh, my God, that's them. Whereas later, of course, when Philonias Monk came to London, which I did see, it was the Festival Hall, it was silent, it was full of admiration. It was just odd that he was America taking all his music for granted. It was extraordinary. But I went to see Roland Kirk, who, if you remember, was famous.

[00:06:21.090] - Speaker 1
He would play several instruments at once. It was a breathtaking, amazing show. Someone had obviously told him, somebody figured out who we were and told him He was trying to say the right thing. He said something about... But he had it all muddled and he said something about the Beatles. Not that we were the Beatles, but somehow it was him being very sweet and trying to acknowledge the fact that someone had told him these people with a number one record were in town, but he knew nothing. I kept wanting to go, It's okay. We don't expect you to. You're magic idles and heroes. Of course, you don't know who we are. Of course, I do know who you are, and that's how it's supposed to be. But it didn't seem that Was it unusual that at your age that you were enthralled with American music, or was that what young English kids liked? I think it was universal. That was what we all liked, particularly rhythm and blues, of course. I used to go every Monday night to Ken Collier's Jazz Club, just off the Jancross Road, because Monday night was R&B night, and the house band was the Rolling Stones, and I used to go and see them every Monday.

[00:07:27.050] - Speaker 1
Before they'd ever made records, I remember make on stage we're talking about. We just got to make our first single, which was Come on, the Chuck Berry song. It was coming out next week and Please Come buy it, and that thing.

[00:07:39.880] - Speaker 2
At that time, they were playing all covers, yes?

[00:07:41.740] - Speaker 1
All covers. I always point out to people, even the Beatles, before they started writing their own songs, which it turned out they did rather well. But until that time, I don't think they ever sang an English song that I can think of. The only English songs that were ever hits in America were oddities. It was like, does your tune go and lose the flavor on the bedpost overnight or Stranger on the Shore, Acker Bilt. That was the pre-British invasion, British invasion. But our rock stars, like Cliff, never made it. Eventually, he had some a hit, but he was never Cliff like he is in England. Many a tear has to fall, but it's all in the game. All in the wonderful game that we know as love.

[00:08:47.900] - Speaker 2
I guess, really, until the Beatles, until Bob Dylan and the Beatles, everybody did covers. Like in the Frank Sinatra model, you sang standards.

[00:08:58.110] - Speaker 1
Yes, or you sang something in the Carol and and Jerry had written for you. That thing. Or Neil Diamond, or one of those, the right to order people who were so brilliant. Here's one or the other.

[00:09:10.420] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get to go to the Brill building and see that world?

[00:09:13.820] - Speaker 1
No, not really. I later on got to meet everybody who was part of it. We used to pay a lot of attention when we bought records to the names in the little brackets under the song title, because we knew that these were the magic people who came with this music that was so brilliant. That's why when I finally met Carol, which I did through Danny Kortschmer, who had played with Peter and Gordon, he was in a band called the Kingbees. When we toured America, the promoters would hire a band, or actually several bands, and there's in different areas of the country, to be the backup band. Of course, they didn't go out and hire terrific individual musicians. They just looked for some out-of-work group who would do it on the cheap and learn They'd say, Just learn these songs, which was fine. Some of them were fairly good, some of them were awful. One of the good ones was the Kingbees. Danny Kortemar and I became great friends. Of course, he's the one who introduced me to James later on. He introduced me when I came out to LA, finally, to Carol. He'd been in a band called The City with Carol.

[00:10:18.980] - Speaker 1
My first move was a big fan grovel about all the songs she'd written, all of which I knew. People didn't realize. She had so many hits then. So many. It was like Diane Warren plus. Not only that, but suddenly to switch from Diane Warren plus to being a leading member of the singer-songwriter movement. Amazing.

[00:10:42.640] - Speaker 2
Extraordinary. Amazing. Tell me more about London in the '60s, just what was the atmosphere and what was it like pre... I'll call it British invasion. It wasn't the British invasion for you, but maybe pre-rock and roll into rock and roll.

[00:10:58.800] - Speaker 1
It was fantastic. I mean, it was London... First of all, I always think that the '60s grew so much out of the '50s because people forget that the '50s were so different in London and in America. London was rationing till 1956. Shortages. They took rationing off individual items one at a time. The last thing to go, whatever it was, was '56. It was very much a tighten your belt spirit of the blitz. And Britain was a A pretty primitive country. Something like half of Britain didn't have indoor plumbing or refrigerators.

[00:11:35.240] - Speaker 2
Was there a memory of the war?

[00:11:40.050] - Speaker 1
Yes. Bomsites everywhere still. A lot of rebuilding to be done. And a lot of people had obviously lost family in the war. The war was an omnipresent theme and the general shortages and grimness. I think part of it was us deciding, we're going to do something different We admire everything our parents accomplished, but we'd rather have fun and dress up in silly clothes and stuff. And I think that the willful desire to have a good time grew out of the fact that for a while, nobody was allowed to have a good time because we were too busy beating the Nazis, which was a thing. And then basically, we had some help from some allies, but you never really had to get your hands dirty in the grimness of it, except for losing people. Absolutely. But they didn't bomb New York or anything dramatic. And so it was very different. Our admiration for America became great because the Americans we met were all charming and funny and rich by our standards. And obviously, as you know, the soldiers had the silt stockings that the girls wanted and all the things that we didn't have. And so it was, I think for quite a while, the war was an excuse for a lot of shortcomings that Britain had and took a while to recover from.

[00:13:06.410] - Speaker 1
So it was different. And musically, the music we had, some of the people were really good. I mean, I'm a Cliff fan. I was a Billy Dury fan. God knows I was a Dusty fan, which was leaning into the British invasion, but we loved them all. But we didn't think of them as real rock stars, the real ones who are American. I was a child actor, and I was in films where some of the people would be English movie stars. The first film I ever did, my father was played by Jack Hawkins, who you may remember, was in Bridge on the River, Kua, and Lawrence of Arabia, and military Three Gentlemen. That was exciting. But the real excitement was that my mother was played by a real movie star because my mother was played by Claudette Colbeher. Of course, she was a real movie star because she was American. We went, That's the reason. We all knew movie stars come from Hollywood, rock stars come from America. That's how it was then. That's what the Beatles changed completely.

[00:14:08.830] - Speaker 2
Do you remember if it was... Did you hear of Elvis before you heard of Chuck Berry and Little Richard?

[00:14:14.370] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:14:15.180] - Speaker 2
Elvis was first.

[00:14:16.150] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think so. First was Heartbreak Hotel. That was huge.

[00:14:22.190] - Speaker 2
How old would you have been?

[00:14:24.330] - Speaker 1
I don't know. What year do you think Heartbreak Hotel was?

[00:14:26.710] - Speaker 2
I have no idea.

[00:14:27.060] - Speaker 1
I'm not good with names.

[00:14:28.770] - Speaker 2
How old did you Still.

[00:14:30.800] - Speaker 1
16, 17. That might be right.

[00:14:33.960] - Speaker 2
It was not long after hearing that that you start making music?

[00:14:37.820] - Speaker 1
No, not at all. We used to do it, several Elvis songs. We did Elvis songs, and then obviously we did Buddy Holly songs and Everly Brothers, of course, as a duo, you know who your favorites are. It's one area in which there's no discussion. You ask Sam and the Garfinkel or Chad and Jeremy or John and Paul, who are you trying to copy? It's always the same band. If we'd met a couple more people at school who wanted to play, we might have been a group like everybody else. But we sounded good just the two of us, and we stuck to it.

[00:15:10.810] - Speaker 2
Did you sing Everly Brothers songs in the beginning?

[00:15:12.810] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. Yeah, all the And of course, one of our favorite Everly songs ties the whole thing together because it was Crying in the Rain, which was written by Carole King.

[00:15:24.180] - Speaker 3
I'll never let you see the way my broken heart is hurting me.

[00:15:33.640] - Speaker 1
I've got my pride and I know how to hide all my sorrow and pain. I'll do my Crying in the Rain It was a Carole King song and the Neveley Brothers song.

[00:15:51.510] - Speaker 2
I didn't know she wrote that.

[00:15:52.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, she did with Howard Greenfield with the lyrics. It wasn't Gothen and King. It was Greenfield and King, as we discovered, because we researched those names. And we didn't know who King was at all. It could have been Mr. King for all we knew. Eventually, we found out about this amazing woman. She wrote Willy Salami Tomorrow for the Sherrells when she was 18 and never looked back.Unbelievable.Just wrote one hit after another.Unbelievable..

[00:16:15.290] - Speaker 2
What a great piano player. Just the feeling in her piano player.

[00:16:18.800] - Speaker 1
Well, that's the funny part, of course, because it was when I came to make Sweet Baby James, which we didn't have a title for yet, which was going to be the first American album after the Apple album, I'd done in London with English musicians and which I'd decorated quite a lot with orchestration and stuff. I wanted to keep Sweet Baby James simple. By then, I'd heard exactly that, the original Screen Gems demos of all those Carol songs, and I loved her piano playing. It was the ultimate not jazzy, not too fancy chords, but perfect and very soulful, nonetheless, piano playing. When I first met Carol, I asked her if she would play on James' album, she would give me a week to just be a studio person, which was asking a lot because I knew she was a goddess of songwriting, and I knew that she was planning gradually to make her own record as well.

[00:17:14.420] - Speaker 2
She hadn't made Tapestry yet?

[00:17:16.150] - Speaker 1
No, no, not at all. She'd done, I think, this album, The City, which was her and Kuch and Charlie Laki. I think that was that, but she hadn't done Tapestry at all. No, tapestry came after that, and that's the whole You've Got A Friends story, which tied tapestry into our world. But anyway, to backtrack for a second. I fell in love with a piano player in Austin, and she said, yes. She didn't know who James was. She came over to my house. At that point, I was in a rented house down on Longwood Avenue in Hancock Park, corner of Olympic Boulevard, 400 a month with a guest house in a pool. She came over there to to meet James, and they met. I sat her down and asked her to just play. They started just making up stuff and playing. It was entirely magical. We found our piano player.

[00:18:12.150] - Speaker 2
Did you have any a tape recorder there? No.

[00:18:16.060] - Speaker 1
Sadly, no. It would have been nice. I know. No, I've got... Because I remember I've got a picture of the room, and we had no furniture because I had no money. We had a rented piano, and there's a picture of James playing the piano with the Cat, Cat was free, sitting on the piano. But we rehearsed in the afternoon and went into Sunset Sound that night and cut the three or four tracks we'd worked on. Amazing. Took a week.

[00:18:41.440] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:18:42.930] - Speaker 1
We felt guilty because we had a record deal. We got 20,000 in front and 20,000 on delivery. We made the whole album for $7,600. We went, That was easy.

[00:18:54.850] - Speaker 2
Well, it made it better. It was like it's a funny thing. Exactly. Sometimes throwing more money at a project doesn't make it better. Exactly.

[00:19:01.030] - Speaker 1
As I say, we had no money to speak of. There's that track on that album that's called Sweet for 20 G, and people are always puzzled for a while with all kinds of magical explanations. It was to get the $20,000 on delivery. James had said, I've got any more songs. We have to wait. I said, Would you played me some good bits? He said, Well, none of them have turned into songs. They're not finished. I said, Well, could you play them to me? He played them. I said, Well, let's string them together. If you listen to it, they're distinctly three separate songs, different tempos, different keys. He put them all together. It was the only James Taylor song ever had a hand in naming because he said, What should I call it? I said, Sweet for 20 G so that we can collect the money. There it is on the record. I can say someday I will be. When I catch a common cold, I want to hear a saxophone. When I let the good times roll, baby, start me a bass trombone. As I say, people would go, What is what mysterious, meaningful title was that?

[00:20:22.800] - Speaker 1
And I went, Very simple.

[00:20:24.680] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the other British Invasion bands. There was Dave Clark Five and Hermann's Hermanns and Freddie of the Dreamers. There was a bunch of them. Yes. Tell me what the scene was like, and did it feel like a community of- It did.

[00:20:43.690] - Speaker 1
We used to run in It was all on TV shows all the time. That's where you'd meet Freddie of the Dreamers. It was when you do Top of the pops, Thank You, Lucky Stars, or Ready, Steady, Go. Ready, Steady, Go was the most fun because it was live. You played live. Most of them were lip sync. But That's where you met, and you'd occasionally meet in a place called the Blue Boar. I don't know if you're familiar with that. But going up and down the M1, which is Britain's first ever motorway. So whatever gig you were going to, if it was north of London, you took the M1 and then had one rest stop, which was open all night, which is a café, you get egg and chips and stuff. You'd go in there, and almost always there'd be another band in there because everyone was zooming out and down the M1 playing all these various gigs. I remember meeting the Kinks in there or, gosh, I can't remember, the Yard Birds. Other people, you'd see them at the Blue Boar on the M1. It's got legendary status and eating greasy food at 2:00 in the morning or something on your way back to London.

[00:21:47.380] - Speaker 2
Would you get to see all those bands play live as well?

[00:21:50.190] - Speaker 1
Sometimes. When you shared a bill with them, you did for sure. During these TV shows, you did. But I think there was a distinction. I think the real bands everyone knew were the kinks, zombies, yard birds, bands that you really wanted.

[00:22:04.800] - Speaker 2
Zombies were so cool and so different than everybody else.

[00:22:07.810] - Speaker 1
Yes. They're still great. Yeah. Singing and playing, they're both great. Yeah, they're important bands. We were in between. Then Freni and the Dreamer's one of the bands, nobody really took that seriously, but he was a nice guy and they were catchy records and so on. Then Hermann, very cleverly, took that English musical thing, vaudeville aspect of it and made them into hits.

[00:22:32.170] - Speaker 2
That was also a big influence on Paul's writing, the Vaudville.

[00:22:36.340] - Speaker 1
Yes, absolutely. Your Mother Should Know and all those kinds of things. Yes, I think maybe that's something that we added a bit to. We took American Rock and Roll, and even Peter and Gordon finally succumbed, and we did Lady Godiva. I remember actually thinking when we were sent that song, I was the one going, I don't know. It's a bit novelty record. Does this suddenly make us spreading the dreamers, as it were. Nothing against them at all. But Gordon was the one said, Don't be so snooty. It's quite funny and quite catchy. It might even It was a hit. It was a hit. Actually, when we do shows now, it's one of those ones that's much in demand. It was huge in Canada, I remember. We found a copy of the Chum Canadian chart when Lady Godiva was number one, which it wasn't in America for sure. But yeah, it's a fun song to sing, too. When I do shows, I do that.

[00:23:34.700] - Speaker 2
I grew up listening to classic rock radio, and you'd hear Lady Godiva all the time. Yes. It's a standard on American classic '60s music It's one of the standards.

[00:23:46.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's funny because I remember this session, I kept trying to make it more like a Kinks record. I mean, the original, I don't know if you remember the beginning of Lady Godiva, but the record itself now just starts with pretty much bass and kick. It's just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.

[00:24:13.240] - Speaker 3
But originally, all that had horns and stuff on it.

[00:24:24.140] - Speaker 1
It was a even more novelty band than it was. I took all that out against our producers' best wishes, but I felt strongly that just the boom, boom. I was stealing it from Sunny Afternoon.

[00:24:38.740] - Speaker 2
How great is Sunny Afternoon?

[00:24:40.590] - Speaker 1
It's a masterpiece. I went, let's steal that. That boom, boom, boom, boom, which no one's ever called me out on. But the beginning, it was as close as I could get it to being a direct steal from how great sunny afternoon sounds. I was trying to make it a little more kinks clever and a little less totally vaudreville silly. But whatever the compromise was seemed to work.

[00:25:05.090] - Speaker 2
Do you ever get to see the zombies live?

[00:25:07.920] - Speaker 1
Not back then, no. I've seen Colin and what's his name since then.

[00:25:12.300] - Speaker 2
Rod Argent, maybe?

[00:25:13.450] - Speaker 1
Rod, yeah, that's right. Yeah, and then he had that big hit with a Denny Lane song that was my favorite Denny Lane song, Say You Don't Mind. Then that became a hit for Rod Argent. Yeah.

[00:25:24.350] - Speaker 2
It was surprising. Incredible keyboard player.

[00:25:27.720] - Speaker 1
Brilliant keyboard player.

[00:25:27.890] - Speaker 2
I think he did a lot of sessions, too. Probably. I think so.

[00:25:33.380] - Speaker 1
You had a lot of interesting people playing on sessions then. Jimmy Page played on a couple of hours. Then the legendary guitar team at that time was Big Jim Sullivan and Vic Flick. Vic Flick played a lot. He played the solo on World Without Love. He's, of course, the same guy who played the. Played the Bond theme. I forget which records Jimmy Page played on, but a of them. He was one of the guys who was around. Then there were also some guys that were a bit older who were from the previous team, but also were really good players.

[00:26:10.600] - Speaker 2
Was there a big studio musician scene at that point in time? Was there a big studio musician scene at that point in time?

[00:26:15.180] - Speaker 1
I don't know, but yes, I think they were all working a lot. I remember my favorite drum was a guy called Kenny Claire, who was the drummer in the Johnny Dankworth Band. I don't know that band. Johnny Dankworth was a big jazz guy in England. Very in the British jazz scene, which is a very separate and, again, a complete copy of the American jazz scene, but some wonderful players. Kenny Claire, who played on a couple of Peter and Gordon records, was a brilliant big band drummer and played a lot. We put some of that in there just because he did it so well.

[00:26:50.240] - Speaker 2
I just learned from Graham Nash that Skifle music was based on American music. Oh, completely. I didn't know that because we didn't have Skifle. No, I know. Whereas for all of the other, for the blues, for every other genre that was popular in the UK, we had the equivalent here.

[00:27:10.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I guess it's jug band, that thing. People forget about Lonnie Donovan, of course, was the big guy. I was talking to Jack White not long ago, and he turns out to be a huge Lonnie Donovan fan. He knew all his records and everything. I was so impressed because Lonnie Donovan fans are rare in America. It's It figures that he would be somebody who got it.

[00:27:32.470] - Speaker 2
Was he a movie star as well?

[00:27:33.850] - Speaker 1
No. He came out of the jazz scene. I see. He was the Banjo player. When I say Banjo, it would be four-string, chinka-chinka Banjo, not five-string bluegrass. In the Chris Barber jazz band. You know before, Skifle was the big, the trad scene, as they called it, which was traditional jazz, Dixieland to you. Chris Barber was the biggest band. The band was very big, and they do their set with all the haunt section and everything. Then they would have in the middle of the show a section of Lonnie Donegan doing a couple of folk songs and stuff on his Banjo with maybe the bass player and stuff. That was the beginning of Lonnie Donegan. To some degree, I think the beginning of Skiffle. Then Lonnie Donegan had Rock Island Lime, which was massive, which is a lead belly song.

[00:28:21.470] - Speaker 2
Dead or Alive also was a big one, I remember.

[00:28:23.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's right. Then there were other Skiffle groups like the Vipers, who were very good. But Lonnie Donegan was the of Skiffle, literally described as such. It began with him. He would do a tiny segment in Chris Barber's jazz band Evenings. I used to play in a jazz band. I played bass very badly, but you could get away with it. In a band, mostly notable that the band leader and trumpet player was Adrian Line, the film director. So we'd known each other forever. Amazing. Played together in a band, which was exciting.

[00:28:56.830] - Speaker 2
What motivated your decision to move to California?

[00:29:00.410] - Speaker 1
James. I had been to California, of course, several times on tour and to do TV shows and do shindig and whatever. And I loved California. It was amazing. You have to remember what British people are coming from. So So I mean, for me, literally, the contrast was so stark because one year I was a philosophy student at London University, King's College, London. So that on a winter afternoon, I would be bicycling home from university in the dark, because by four o'clock in British winter, it's dark and the rain. And a year later, I was driving down Sunset Boulevard in a Mustang Averteible being recognized by beautiful women in the sunshine. And I went, I think this is better. Call me crazy. But this seems like a lot more fun. So I knew I'd come back and live in America one day. I knew the... Even before Peter and Gordon, I had posters of the New York skyline on my bedroom wall. Interesting. And as I say, copies of downbeat with Jazz Club, so I knew my America was in my future somewhere. And once I'd been here and it lived up to our expectations because we dreamed of coming to America and then to come and be chased around my teenage girls trying to take your clothes off, it gets no better than that.

[00:30:26.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, so California, the decision was part of the decision to manage James. In other words, producing and managing came to me in entirely different ways. Being a record producer was something I had an ambition to do in and of itself. Once I'd realized there was such a job that you could have a job where you could hire brilliant musicians much better than yourself and tell them what to do. I thought, How cool is that? As you well know. It's extremely cool. That was an ambition regardless of who it was. I first record ever produced was a Paul Jones record. I don't know if you remember Paul Jones. He was the lead singer of Manfred Man in the Duaddi era. There she was just to walk in. That guy, brilliant singer and one of the best harmonica players in the world. I produced his record, and by that time, Paul and I were already friends. I asked Paul if he would play on it, play drums on it. Paul McCartney played drums. Paul Samuel Smith from the Yard Birds played bass, who It went on, of course, to produce Carly Simon and Kat Stevens. Nicky Hopkins played piano, and Jeff Beck played guitar.

[00:31:37.230] - Speaker 1
I was taking no chances on my first record.

[00:31:40.660] - Speaker 2
How great was that band?

[00:31:41.950] - Speaker 1
It was a great band. It was a really good band. It's worth hearing. The record wasn't a big hit. It crept into the charts and crept out again, but it's good, worth hearing. Whereas managing was quite different. I was already producing James. We'd made the Apple album, came out, didn't do particularly well. We were just trying to start what to do. Apple was falling apart. The Beatles were falling apart. We decided to leave and jump ship. And so I decided to move to America because James had a conversation about management. It was clear to us that somebody needed to be his manager. We didn't know anyone we trusted to do it. So I said to James, well, I'll do it. Yes, I was being gold and saying, how hard can it be? But I was also having watched Brian Epstein, realized that one's instincts were correct, that it wasn't that hard if you had an amazing client.

[00:32:33.420] - Speaker 2
You cared, which is something that-And you cared. That's a big difference. And you weren't your crook, right? Yeah. It wasn't just a gig. You love this artist.

[00:32:43.590] - Speaker 1
Exactly. If you're going to go around saying, My band is going to be bigger than Elvis, you better mean it. I thought, if you're reasonably intelligent, love your artist to the point in every sense of the word and not just trying to make a quick doll Well, it becomes a matter of largely of common sense. People do often say to me, what's the secret of being a great manager? And I do explain that I inducted the first two managers into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame because I knew them both, I'd buy them both, and they were not surprisingly Brian Epstein and Andrew Lou Goldem. And I went, what does this tell you? Secret of being a great manager is a great client. It doesn't mean that you couldn't screw it up if you tried. But if you're going around telling your own a genius, James Taylor is, it's easy because it's true. My ambition was to convince people this is not just another long-haired folkie with an acoustic guitar, which is what you were. If you had long-haired players with an acoustic guitar, you were a folk singer. It didn't matter if you never sang any folk songs.

[00:33:45.860] - Speaker 1
I mean, James did, but you were playing the folk clubs. The word singer-songwriter, ugly enough, had never been used in that context. It hadn't been put together that way. You could be a songwriter and a singer, but suddenly, Oh, a singer songwriter. Now I've got a name for what I do.

[00:34:02.980] - Speaker 2
It was a whole movement in the '70s.

[00:34:04.940] - Speaker 1
It became a movement. They put James on the cover of Time magazine. It was Joni, it was Neil, it was James. Then a minute later, it was Jackson and so on. That was the singer-songwriter thing.

[00:34:16.910] - Speaker 2
Well, let's go back because you talked about Apple was falling apart. Tell me about Apple from the beginning. Were you at Apple from the beginning? Yes. Tell me about the entire Apple story.

[00:34:26.440] - Speaker 1
Okay. Paul and I were friends. Even after he moved out of our house, he lived with us for a couple of years on the top floor of our house. Then when he moved out to his mansion in Cavendish Avenue, where he still lives, that's when I mostly remember him talking about Apple. It was a Beatle collective idea, but it was mainly him, and the others were falling into place behind him. And he wanted to create a entertainment company. And at that era, you may remember, it was before Or record companies started vying with each other for the title of Artist friendly. That concept didn't really exist. I mean, the head of EMI was a man called Sir Joseph Lockwood. And when you walked into his office, you felt like you should bow. He was in a suit behind a big desk. He was Sir Joseph, and he was the boss. Everybody had that thing, which they still have. We don't accept unsolicited material. No, don't bother us. Go away. Now it's different. It's don't bother us until you got 20 zillion followers, all those numbers. But back then, they said, no, you need to have a lawyer or a manager to talk to us, all that.

[00:35:36.600] - Speaker 1
Very hands-off. Paul was convinced that if we just took a more amiable, accessible, hospitable Dude. It was going to be records and films and television and all this other stuff. But so he asked me- This also makes sense from Paul after the Beatles were rejected by everyone for a long time.

[00:35:56.530] - Speaker 2
That's right. In his mind, it's like, there's more of us out here.

[00:36:00.630] - Speaker 1
That's right. That's a very good point.

[00:36:02.400] - Speaker 2
It makes sense. It makes sense for that mentality.

[00:36:05.750] - Speaker 1
The sad thing was, it was that- It didn't happen.

[00:36:08.340] - Speaker 2
It didn't happen. Could it have happened?

[00:36:10.240] - Speaker 1
Well, yes. I mean, I suppose it could have. I mean, the funny part is Apple now would make a bit of sense to start a completely independent label that truly listened. I had four or five people because we took ads saying, Send us your music. Boy, did they ever? But the depressing thing was we I really got nothing out of those send-in tapes. A depressing percentage was people with this stack, for example, a giant stack of lyrics that don't scan and don't rhyme. And I know John Lennon wants to write music for all my lyrics, and it's going to bring about world peace or whatever. It was depressing how nutty some of it was, how bad some of it was, and how what the percentage of actually let's play this in our meeting and then say no. That was a triumph. When there was something I actually thought I could play to the Beatles and say, what do you think? Because we had weekly A&R meetings. I think the King of Fur came out of one of those meetings. Do you know about the King of Fur? An artist called Bruteforce, who I believe is still around.

[00:37:25.890] - Speaker 1
Wow, great. This is the only thing I It could be wrong. But I think it's the only thing we ever played in an A&R meeting and actually went, Let's sign it. We let's sign it because George thought it was hilarious. It was a song, the lyrics of which, largely consistent, I'm the King of fur, I'm the Fur King. We all laughed. George said, We have to put it out. We have to put it out. Of course, EMI and Capital went, No, you don't. We went, Yes, we do. We had to get some other distributor to do it because EMI wouldn't do it. But it did come out. As a guy called Brute Force, who might still be around.

[00:38:05.580] - Speaker 2
It's a funny name.

[00:38:06.320] - Speaker 1
It's a great name. But I think that might be the only thing because we signed Mary Hopkins because we saw her on a talent show. I see. Twiggy actually saw her. Twiggy, as I recall, Twiggy was watching this show called Opportunity Knocks, which was like any star talent show. If you got through to the next round, you came back next week and so on. Mary Hopkins was singing a Joan Bayes song, There But For Fortune, and had such a great song. Great song. Twiggy called Paul, their good friends still are, and Paul called me. We all watched it. We all went down to Wales and signed her up. Then that led to Those Were the Days, which, of course, was an incredible song.

[00:38:51.990] - Speaker 2
Who wrote Those Are The Days?

[00:38:53.720] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Very good question. Paul had been to a nightclub called the Blue Angel some weeks or, I think months previously, where a duo called Jean and Francesca, I think, an American duo, had sang Those Were the Days. And he had made a mental note of it, obviously. Because when he signed Mary Hobgin, he knew what record he was going to make with her, and he knew that it was going to be a huge hit. It turned out, we credited them with the song. It turned out it's actually a Russian folk song. That is as Russian as it sounds. Paul said, We need to find that song, which we did. He knew he wanted to do it. He wanted the The instrument, the cymbalom. A cymbalom, you hear it in movie music quite a lot. It's a big hammer dulcimer. It's like a hammer dulcimer, but then it looks like a zither where the strings cross over with each other and you play it with hammers like a dulcimer. On those were the days that, that plays the solo and the intro is the cymbalom. I defined the best cymbalom player in London, which I did for Paul, because in this instance, Head of A&R meant help Paul make the record, which is fine with me.

[00:40:19.630] - Speaker 1
We did it at EMI.

[00:40:21.320] - Speaker 2
Which we think of as Abbey Road.

[00:40:23.560] - Speaker 1
Which you think of as Abbey Road because eventually somebody very cleverly changed the name to make it worth more money. That was when they were in the process of selling it. Yeah, and I suggested The Arranger because what happened was, and this is a whole other story, but- Tell it. When I was doing the James album, as I said, I added different instruments on it, and they're I decorated with string quartet and brass quartet and this, that, and the other. I wanted it to not sound too necessarily pop. A friend of mine called Richard Houston, I had played in a jazz group with me. He was a trumpet guitar player, but I knew also that he was a classical musician. I asked him to write all the charts for that, which he did. That was how he came to be involved with Apple. When Paul wanted the strings and everything on those were the days, I said, You met Richard, who did the stuff on the James album. He went, Oh, great. He'll do. He wrote the arrangement on Those Were The Days and became the in-house Apple arranger guy, which, of course, is how he ended up unknowingly writing the Long and Winding Road arrangement that Paul hated only because he didn't want it to be there.

[00:41:38.560] - Speaker 1
But obviously, if you get a call from somebody saying, Phil Specter, wants you to write an arranger, it's for the Beatles long. You go, yes. You don't go, Do the Beatles know this is going on? The answer was one of them didn't. But it's a beautiful arrangement. I still like the one without it, but better. But that's all the story.

[00:41:58.320] - Speaker 2
I think I like it better with it just because I grew up with it. Yeah, exactly. That's how the song goes to me.

[00:42:02.840] - Speaker 1
It's good. It's really good. Richard's terrific.

[00:42:05.890] - Speaker 2
How many employees were there at Apple?

[00:42:08.570] - Speaker 1
Don't know. There were Apple Publishing, Apple Films, and obviously Apple Records.

[00:42:17.760] - Speaker 2
Would you say it was in the neighborhood of 20 people or 50 people?

[00:42:21.380] - Speaker 1
I would say it was in between those two numbers. I see. Would be my guess, yes. Because there were quite a few assistants and secretaries and the guy on the floor. It might be a size 50.

[00:42:33.450] - Speaker 2
The office was in that whole building?

[00:42:35.260] - Speaker 1
Well, we started off in Wigmore Street, I think. No, we started off in Baker Street. Can't remember why we kept moving. But then we moved to Wigmore Street, and then finally, they'd I bought this building. I think they bought it, and God knows they shouldn't have sold it, but I can't imagine what it's worth. It was such a great building. I was on the top floor. It was fun.

[00:42:54.760] - Speaker 2
Do you remember what was on the other floors?

[00:42:57.330] - Speaker 1
Yes, some of them. Ground floor was the entrance way. I think Peter Brown's office/General Beatles office might have been on the ground floor. What did Peter Brown do? On what we would call the first floor.

[00:43:09.720] - Speaker 2
What did he do?

[00:43:10.680] - Speaker 1
Peter Brown was general assistant, kind He was a manager with Neil Aspenal. When Brian died, he'd always been that right-hand man, ambassador. It's funny because he's legend now because his name shows up in the a song about Peter Brown called to say, You can get married, and whatever, which was Peter Brown arranging John and Yoko's Wedding. His name shows up in a song, and everyone goes, Oh, that's the Peter Brown.

[00:43:44.370] - Speaker 2
You also mention the name of the show that Mary Hopkins was seen on, and I never knew that that was the name of a TV show, but there's an outtake of John Lennon saying that name in the studio.

[00:43:55.570] - Speaker 1
Oh, really? Yeah.

[00:43:56.890] - Speaker 2
I always just thought it was a clever line, but he's referring to a TV show.

[00:44:02.220] - Speaker 1
Yes. It's Opportunity Nox was the big TV show. That's where the Beatles hadn't got a record deal. Eventually, maybe they would have ended up on Opportunity Nox. Opportunity Ducks.

[00:44:15.690] - Speaker 2
Was there a studio in the basement?

[00:44:19.150] - Speaker 1
Not yet. Not yet. No one we moved in. There was or was not, depending on how much you judge a studio, whether it works or not in the basement later on. So this basement, Yeah, ground floor admission. I think Beatles office, maybe up one flight of stairs, which is the big office which Neil had an office just off of, I think. That was really the conference room, wherever Beatles were there.

[00:44:44.050] - Speaker 2
If the band came in, that's where they would go. That's where they went.

[00:44:46.380] - Speaker 1
I see. Then next floor up was Derry Taylor's office, which is where the fun was, which is where everything was going to happen.

[00:44:54.100] - Speaker 2
That was the publicity press?

[00:44:56.250] - Speaker 1
Yes, he was pressed. I don't know how much you know about Derry Taylor. Not much. Tell He was brilliant. I mean, amazing, fantastic, interesting man. Worth reading his book. It's called as Time Goes By. He's a wonderful writer, so it's gripping read. The sumptchart was where you go, This is all weird. He finished reading the chapter, find out he was on acid the whole time. That's why the chapter is... But he still wrote beautifully. He was a truly exceptional man. The Beatles loved him dearly, as did I.

[00:45:25.720] - Speaker 2
How did he come into the Beatles world? Do you know?

[00:45:28.330] - Speaker 1
Did Brian find him? I guess he worked for Brian early. Then he went to America and had a PR company, but not like any other PR company. He was much cooler than anybody else. He worked for the Birds, I think, and some other people, and then was asked to come back for Apple.

[00:45:46.760] - Speaker 2
Was the Beatles Brian's first act? Because he owned record stores before this.

[00:45:52.850] - Speaker 1
Yes. As far as I know, I don't think he had any ambitions to be a manager anymore than I did when he heard the Beatles and just went, This is too good to ignore. I mean, he was only in the music business in the sense that he ran a record shop. I think Peter Brown may have worked in the shop with him. Maybe that's how Peter came on board. I think he knew Brian.

[00:46:12.810] - Speaker 2
Tell me more about Derek and Derek's office.

[00:46:16.440] - Speaker 1
Well, Derek's office was the office where the bar was, for example. Derek's top draw hit all kinds of wonders as well. Everyone would end up in there. When the So my office was on the very top floor next to these people who worked with me listening to tapes. And I think Apple Publishing was a guy called Mike O'Connor, who ran Apple Publishing, might have been on the next floor down. There were about five floors, I think, in the basement. But yeah, so Derek's office was where you went later in the day to see what was going on and have a drink or a smoke or whatever was going. And so when the Hell's Angels all arrived or Ken Keese arrived, and no one knew what to do with them. I'll put him in Derek's office. Derek will know what to do. And he did. Derek was brilliant. Derek was also responsible for the close relationship with Harry Nielson. He was a huge Nielson fan. He produced the record. I didn't know that. Harry Nielson. And The Harry and the Beatles always became very close.

[00:47:17.460] - Speaker 2
Would you say everybody in the office is around 25 years old or less?

[00:47:21.620] - Speaker 1
I suppose so, yes.

[00:47:22.930] - Speaker 2
It's a young... Again, we think back and it's this business, and I just want to really picture what it's like.

[00:47:28.630] - Speaker 1
Ron Cass, it's interesting because we hired We thought we needed a real record guy to run the label. We hired this guy, Ron Cass, who was Head of Liberty Records, had been Head of Liberty. We also knew he was cool because he was married to Joan Collins. How could you not be cool if you were married to Joan?

[00:47:44.980] - Speaker 2
I think Lenny Wernicke's dad owned Liberty Records.

[00:47:48.200] - Speaker 1
I think that's right. Ron Cass might have been a little bit older, I think. That's how I got to produce them.

[00:47:55.360] - Speaker 2
He was like the adult.

[00:47:56.460] - Speaker 1
He was the adult. Yes, exactly.

[00:47:57.890] - Speaker 2
But everyone else was kids.

[00:47:59.320] - Speaker 1
I think so. It's cool. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, there were lawyers and accountants and stuff who were there to be grownups. But it was exciting. Yeah, Derek, there's all kinds of Derek adventures you should read up on. There's the trip we all took to record the Black Dyke Mills Band. You know about them? I don't know about them. If you do get Derek's book, read that chapter if you read nothing else because it's-I'll read the whole thing.

[00:48:24.650] - Speaker 2
It sounds great.

[00:48:25.300] - Speaker 1
It's fantastic. The Black Dyke Mills Band. Paul was invited to write a theme tune for a show called 'Thing & Me, Bob', a television show called 'Thing & Me, Bob'. He wrote this melody, which was really good and catchy. He decided he wanted it done by a brass band. Brass bands are quite a big thing in England. It's a very traditional English business. All the factories up north used to have their own brass band, and they had brass band competitions and all that stuff. All just trumpets and euphoniums and some of those instruments that are in show up in marching bands and brass bands. So he wanted to jump by a brass band, so we found the best brass band who'd won the competition that last year called the Black Dyke Mills Band, which was their factory. And they were terrific. And we had the arrangement written out for them. But we did the recording up near where they all were, up in Yorkshire. So we drove up and did the recording and stuff. And it was on the ride back that we had all kinds of these adventures. We stopped in some town. There's a whole bit in it where Paul says, he gave me the map to choose the village.

[00:49:40.420] - Speaker 1
He couldn't decide where we were going to look for it, have lunch on the dinner or whatever on the way back. So I picked a town called Harold because I liked it. It was an unusual name for a town. It has two R's. So we stopped in Harold and we were in this huge Rolls, Daimler or something. And so it was It was a matter of seconds before the entire town of Harold knew who had just arrived because we'd stopped and talked to one guy who was trimming his hedge and we were looking for somewhere to eat. Then he ended up inviting us all in, and his wife made us food. It's a whole adventure. We ended up back in the pub. Paul ended up on the piano. There's all these people still. If you look it all up, there's people still reminiscing about when I was a kid.

[00:50:26.650] - Speaker 2
Fantastic.

[00:50:28.240] - Speaker 1
Paul McCartney stopped in our town and sat in the pub and played us a bunch of new songs, including Hey, Jude, by the way, which he'd just written. You can see kids would go, No, but it's in black and white and it's all true and so on. Then Derek says, that's an example of one of the ones where Derek says, Paul gave the book to Peter Asher. Peter Asher looked at it for what seemed like three hours, but it was probably 30 seconds. Amazing. Oh, okay. That's right. I remember that now.

[00:50:58.860] - Speaker 2
How many years was was that Apple experiment? How long were you guys in that building?

[00:51:02.680] - Speaker 1
I don't know. I'm very bad at dates and times.

[00:51:04.870] - Speaker 2
But guessing, just give me a feeling.

[00:51:06.700] - Speaker 1
Two years, maybe.

[00:51:07.670] - Speaker 2
Yeah, so short. It was a short.

[00:51:09.760] - Speaker 1
Short.

[00:51:10.860] - Speaker 2
It went bad quickly.

[00:51:12.660] - Speaker 1
Yes, there were big rouse going on. It was mostly about Alan. I mean, yes, the Yoko thing was a contributive factor. Did it add...

[00:51:20.570] - Speaker 2
Did having Apple add to the pressure of the Beatles? Had the Apple idea not happened and had the Beatle's just been the Beatles, would there have been more of a chance that they would have found a way to-I think if the Apple idea had happened, but Brian hadn't died, the Apple thing wouldn't have made that much difference.

[00:51:43.160] - Speaker 1
But I think because Brian He was the glue. Then there's a hole and there's nobody to go, let's think about how to make this make more sense. I see. The account is telling us it's out of control because it was all those discussions that led to John going, we need somebody to be in charge of all this. I know the right guy. Paul said, no, you don't. I know about that guy. He's a crook, whatever the conversation was, because I knew he was a crook. I was already warned off him by people.

[00:52:13.800] - Speaker 2
I believe John was, too. Wasn't he warned off on him by the Rolling Stones?

[00:52:19.160] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think so, which you think would be enough. But Alan was very clever. Alan's whole line was, everyone's going to tell you not to do business with me. That's because they're all scared of me. They're going to say that I'm a complete cunt, and I am. That may be true. But I'm on your side. But I'm yours. That's what you need. John liked that. You can see John going for the idea that someone who's really tough and unpleasant is going to be beneficial to them, which is maybe there's some truth to it, but he also was a bit crooked and would sign stuff that he wasn't supposed to be signing and transfer things he wasn't supposed to transfer and be a creep. Having a creep on your side is risky because he's still a creep.

[00:53:05.410] - Speaker 2
Do you ever get to meet Alan?

[00:53:06.590] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:07.240] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that.

[00:53:08.570] - Speaker 1
I met him, and I'd heard about him already from some friends who worked for the Rolling Stones, and How long did he work- We didn't talk about much. James had a meeting with him.

[00:53:18.040] - Speaker 2
How long did he work with the Stones? Do you know?

[00:53:19.820] - Speaker 1
No, I don't. I know that he had Sam Cooke already when he was doing it, which also would impress the Stones. Yeah, of course. He had Sam Cooke's publishing.

[00:53:29.670] - Speaker 2
What What was the feeling when you met him?

[00:53:31.950] - Speaker 1
He was out to impress. He wanted to be the tough guy. It was clear that I expected him to fire everybody. I quit. I'm one of the people who didn't get fired because once I decided to leave, I wrote a letter of resignation, which is the only thing I haven't found. It must be somewhere in the Apple vaults because they kept a lot of stuff. I'd be curious to see whether I gave any reasons for resigning, but I definitely left. And of course, he did fire everybody. It carried on for a very short length of time. John, as you know, admires that toughness. He just went, Oh, he's going to show him. He did, but he showed everybody, including the Beatles. That was the problem.

[00:54:15.980] - Speaker 2
Before this, we were talking about coming to California and how different it was. What was the music scene like here versus there?

[00:54:25.400] - Speaker 1
Trying to remember who I went to see. I saw the doors once, the Whisky, who I liked the keyboard player. Wasn't sure about the band. Well, Linda actually. Linda runs it, as she said, The band's great. The singer's not good.

[00:54:41.280] - Speaker 2
How did you meet Linda?

[00:54:44.340] - Speaker 1
I was in New York, and I can't remember still who it was who said, There's a girl playing The Bitter End who you should go and see. She's completely amazing. She's an extraordinary singer, got an amazing voice, and she's ridiculously hot. I went, okay. I went to see her and it was all true.

[00:55:02.580] - Speaker 2
Was she still in the band? What were they called?

[00:55:05.360] - Speaker 1
No. The Ponies? Her solo, After the Stone Ponies. She'd had one hit single on her own that long, long time. I talked to her then. I met her then. It got a little bit complicated because John Boylen, who might have been her boyfriend at the time, although then might have been also JD Souther. But anyway, John Boylen had helped her put this band together, which consisted of Dawn Henley and Glenn Frey. And John David had helped with that, too. That was the band I saw her with, I think. It was great. She sang amazingly. Silver Threads and Golden Lidls was the song that I remember, specifically. At the time, there was talk of me. I was initially came in. Linda asked if I would help her produce, finish, sort out the album she was in the middle of, which was a solo album called Don't Cry Now, some of which had been produced by John Boyland, some by John David Sauer. It was all in a bit of a muddle. I did that because I loved her voice and was happy to do it. I forget two or three tracks on that album were officially credited to me.

[00:56:18.810] - Speaker 1
In the meantime, we did have a discussion about management because John recommended that I might be a candidate. But actually, at the time, I'd said no, because I was managing Kate Taylor at the time, who had made an album who I really believed in and love, and I still do. But Kate Taylor then retired. She decided the road was not for her. And the album stayed out and did reasonably okay. We made an album for Atlantic. Ahmed Oettingam was a big fan of hers. And she actually called Linda and said, by the way, I'm not working anymore. So you should talk to Peter again because he loved you. And I think that's... I think Linda called me because Kate told her to, as I recall. I think, and Linda told me that story. Anyway, so we decided that, yes, I would be a manager. That's when the relationship began. Then the next album was the one I produced from scratch, and that was Hot Like a Wheel, where everything changed.

[00:57:14.940] - Speaker 2
Was her voice just astounding? You just couldn't believe it?

[00:57:19.020] - Speaker 1
Couldn't believe it. Then- She's one of the great singers. She's one of the great singers. If you haven't seen the documentary about Linda- I've seen it.

[00:57:27.570] - Speaker 2
I love it.

[00:57:28.430] - Speaker 1
It's so great. And that's when you discover, as you do when you watch the documentary, boy, she's so smart and so well-read and so articulate and extraordinary. And I freely admit the prejudice at the time, I was probably guilty as same as everyone else. You think if someone's that good and that incredibly good-looking and attractive, they couldn't also be brilliant. Yeah, it's too much. It's too much. And I ran into that, of course, the very traditional way that people would assume that I was the one choosing the songs. I was the one in charge of everything. Whereas, in fact, every decision I made, every song I chose, quote chose, was in conjunction with Linda. In terms of choosing songs, it's probably 70, 30 her in terms of production, it's definitely 50/50.

[00:58:17.440] - Speaker 2
But that's good production. It's like whatever is necessary. Exactly. Being the boss isn't the job. No. It's the best result.

[00:58:27.910] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Linda And Frienda freely admits that she's not a producer. She's done it, done it well for some other people, but she gets distracted easily. But once we would decide the mission, and then I would execute it. But she's musically, of course, so Brilliant. The fact that she could turn her genius to so many different musical genres that she would do the rock and roll and the traditional standards and the Mexican rancheras and and beautiful ballads and nail all of them and put so much work into it and suddenly decides she wants to see opera.

[00:59:05.860] - Speaker 2
It kept it very interesting, too. It was very interesting seeing all the changes she went through because the instrument of her voice is so spectacular. Then to It's to put on a whole new...

[00:59:16.180] - Speaker 1
To teach it opera, right? Yeah. Teach that voice, how to sing opera. And she worked... I mean, even the film doesn't quite capture how hard she worked. She would have vocal coaching every day and listen to every version of La Boanne, when she was doing that in New York and so on. She could explain how that's been done.

[00:59:36.580] - Speaker 2
Amazing, too, to have such a natural talent and still the work ethic to do even better or learn something new.

[00:59:43.920] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Her talent is so specific in the sense that it's singing, full stop. She can barely be expected to move when she's singing a song. By today's standards, where everyone has to be able to dance and leap around, she does none of that. The idea of production is appealing to her. When we did the Nelson Riddler stuff and she got to put on those great clothes and fancy hairdos and all that, she liked that. But generally, directors would always go, Okay, on this bit, walk across her, come down the steps. She'd go, No, I'm busy. I'm up here. I'm singing.

[01:00:22.090] - Speaker 2
How many albums did you get to do with her?

[01:00:25.700] - Speaker 1
Gosh, I suppose about five rock and roll ones. Then three Nelson ones. Great. Two Mariachi ones. Great.

[01:00:34.450] - Speaker 2
I love the Mariachi ones.

[01:00:35.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah.sings the shit.So good.Sings the shit out of that.So good.So brilliant. I did those with this guy, Ruben Fuentes, who is the Nelson Riddler mariachi, who was amazing and these great musicians.Great.

[01:01:09.240] - Speaker 2
Idea.my.

[01:01:09.980] - Speaker 1
Respect.great idea.Completely. And of course, people would go, Why are you diverging to all this other kinds of music. She went, No, I'm not diverging. I'm being retroactive. Because they were literally the songs she grew up listening to on her father's knee. They were her father's songs, and that's how she learned them. The weird part is, of course, the political aspect is that, and sociological aspect that back in America, in the '50s, you were instructed, forced to not speak Spanish in front of your children. You were told it's really bad. You're being a bad mother if you speak Spanish in front of your children, they must only learn English to be proper Americans, which is completely insane. I mean, now everyone realizes, of course, you speak Spanish at home, English school, you translate for your granny. That's the way immigration works perfectly, instead of which she learned all these songs. So we'd run into situations when we took the show on the road where she's up there singing in perfect Spanish accent is apparently perfect. She sing so brilliant people would come up at the end of the show and start talking fast in Spanish, and she'd have to go, I'm really sorry, I only sing it, which it seems so weird until How do you understand this business?

[01:02:31.370] - Speaker 1
How she learned it. Linda said in the playground, if two of you started to speak Spanish, you got your hands slapped, physically slapped. Wow. Physically slapped. Wow. Because it was like, that's un-American. No, it's not. That's extremely American. That's the point of America. But even now, as you know, there's people who don't get it.

[01:02:51.110] - Speaker 2
Tell me, how did you come across Tony Joe White?

[01:02:54.220] - Speaker 1
I was a huge fan. I loved... The folks had an alley, saw that Annie I don't remember who suggested that maybe I should do a record with him. Might have been the label. I met him, loved him.

[01:03:07.740] - Speaker 2
What a cool artist. He was wonderful. Nobody else liked that. I know. Very one of a kind.

[01:03:11.680] - Speaker 1
A great songwriter. People get he wrote, was it Rain United in Georgia as well.

[01:03:15.920] - Speaker 2
I didn't know he wrote that. I love that song.

[01:03:17.920] - Speaker 1
Exactly. One of the things I was excited about with Tony Joe, of course, is I got to use some of them musicians down there.

[01:03:25.150] - Speaker 2
Where did you record?

[01:03:26.710] - Speaker 1
Maybe Ardent. Mike Utley played bass. I can't remember who the rest of the band was.

[01:03:32.960] - Speaker 2
Were the band Incredible?

[01:03:34.580] - Speaker 1
Incredible. They were great. I met Mike before because Gordon and I, many years earlier, when we were on the road, when we got to Memphis, we'd made a big point saying, Can we go to the Stax studios? Would they let us in? Our minders, the promotions guys from Capital, going, No, we don't go there. It's not the in a bad part of town or whatever. We said, No, please. That's all we want to see in Memphis. They finally agreed to make the call, and they made the call, and they didn't know we were. They said, Great, come over. It was a fantastic day. We sat in the studio, we met Steve Cropper, who remains a friend.

[01:04:21.860] - Speaker 2
Incredible.

[01:04:22.480] - Speaker 1
Mike Utley, the bass player, Al Jackson, the drummer, and Booker T, of course. They were all coming in and out, and then they played us some tracks. What I didn't realize is they would have some tracks where they just weren't sure whether this might be Rufus, it might be Carla, it might be Otis. They hadn't necessarily decided who was who, but they played these incredible grooves and stuff, which is probably how Green Onion and all the actual Booker T stuff happened. We were so impressed. Jim Stuart, of course, who was the genius behind the whole thing, who was the white guy along Steve Cropper. They established themselves in this largely black part of town making completely black music. It's such a... There must be a Stax documentary there with theirs. I haven't seen it, I don't know if there is.

[01:05:15.530] - Speaker 2
I've never seen one.

[01:05:16.150] - Speaker 1
What a story. I don't know much about Jim Stuart. Somebody said he might still be alive, but he's a recluse. But that's an amazing story that all that music came out of that group of musicians and the number of hits they had, both for other people and for themselves as the MGs, was pretty colossal. Anyway, so I was excited to do Tony Joe. I still think I could have made a better record. I remember doing things that I don't think I should have done. I may have not spent enough time listening to the way they wanted to do it. Because my instinct at the time was, monodrums? I don't think so. Let's move on. So I was I'm going to going, No, I'd rather have the drums spread out like I'm used to, whatever. But I should have done it. Well, look, they made a whole bunch of set records that were so great that I should have started off saying, Just make me a Stax record, and then I'll interfere if needed.

[01:06:18.640] - Speaker 2
Did you ever see the Hell, Hell Rock and Roll movie?

[01:06:23.050] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I was there, of course.

[01:06:24.550] - Speaker 2
I had no idea.

[01:06:26.040] - Speaker 1
Well, I was there because Linda's in it. The one Taylor Hackford did. That's how I got to know Taylor Hackford, who was a friend. Yes, I was there managing Linda because she, to be fair, had made it clear from the beginning that she wouldn't stay for the second show if it was after midnight because she was quite firm on such things She said, I promise I'll get it right first time. So not that you can tell from the performance, but Linda, they only had one take to work from the evening one. And then, of course, Chuck, as you probably know, pulled a similar thing, different grounds. And he went in and said, It's off to midnight. Second show is another day. Double my fee. And they kept going, But Chuck, all these people are doing for nothing. Taylor Hackford, Keith Richards being the band leader of you and conscientious. Keith was doing great. He was really being a band leader and wearing the jacket and the whole thing. And Chuck went, That's very nice of them. They paid him. But in the end, but yes, it's a great movie.

[01:07:30.090] - Speaker 2
I remember when I first saw it, I remember thinking, wow, Chuck is just a jerk. Keith is right about everything. Then I saw it probably 20 years later. It's the same story you just told them watching. It's like, Oh, Keith Richards is telling Chuck Berry how to be Chuck Berry. This is not right. But it only came the wisdom comes with time and experience. But when we're younger, we think we know the right way. Then over time, we learn, Oh, there's a lot of ways to do this and trust the masters.

[01:08:04.080] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. Clearly, the only instruction Chuck needs is be Chuck. That's it. It's just like I saw him rehearse. Might have been the Red Rock show. It was something else. Of course, it was a local band who were backing him up. On one occasion, it happened two or three times, he walked on stage, talked to the guy, said, You know Maybelline? I went, Yeah, he said, You know my show? Left. Because every song starts the same. Every song is mostly in the same key. The band, you still don't know what song you start without knowing what song it is. You just figured it will make itself clear, and it does. Amazing. It's sloppy, but it works.

[01:08:42.310] - Speaker 2
I think to some degree Dylan does a similar thing where he'll just start playing songs, maybe even in a different key.

[01:08:48.240] - Speaker 1
Dylan, you may never find out what song it is.

[01:08:50.370] - Speaker 2
No, but Tom Hedy would talk about when they were the band for Dylan, you just had to try to figure out what was happening. You never knew. You never knew. Nothing was planned, and he would start a song in a different rhythm in a different key, and you just have to listen for some clue. Something vaguely familiar. Usually, someone in the band would like... Everybody would be looking at each other, and one guy in the band would say what it was, and they're like, Oh, okay.

[01:09:15.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's really funny. It makes sense.

[01:09:17.360] - Speaker 2
Tell me about being an artist on Capitol Records, your first trip to the Capitol Records building.

[01:09:23.880] - Speaker 1
It was exciting. How bad? The first time we came into New York, America was New York. I see. We were thrilled. Capital sent us a proper limo, whatever year that would have been a '64 Cadillac limo to pick us up.

[01:09:39.260] - Speaker 2
Was '64 the first year you came? That's when the first hit was. Yes. Amazing.

[01:09:42.660] - Speaker 1
Yes, first hit, '64. We played the World's Fair. We played the globe-y thing. Incredible. Hemisphere.

[01:09:52.230] - Speaker 2
Unosphere. Chemosphere, I think it's called. Hemisphere?

[01:09:55.650] - Speaker 1
Unosphere.

[01:09:56.720] - Speaker 2
I can't remember the name. I think it's the Unosphere. We used to picture that in the gatefold of the Beasty Boys, that first Beastie Boys album. Oh, right. We did a photo session there.

[01:10:04.540] - Speaker 1
Oh, right. Now, did it still have water in the moat? No. Because when we played there, it got this not very deep little canal around it, which was filled with water. It was just the police at that time, it happened to the Beatles all the time. The police would go, no, there's nothing to worry about. We can handle it. It's just a bunch of girls, and don't worry, and would be wrong. It would be completely wrong. They'd be overwhelmed in like 10 seconds. I remember saying, oh, that's cool. There's a moat. And the police went, yeah, the girls won't come across that. Of course, as soon as we went out there, the boys jump in the moat and swim across. It's like an early wet T-shirt contest. It was brilliant. We were going, this is so cool. And these soaking wet girls coming out and hanging us. It was great. I mean, that mania thing was bizarre. The strangest I ever saw, and I've told the story before, but as I said, we played a lot of places where the police would say, Don't worry, and then instant, you come out, which we were part of only in the sense that the Beatles were, again, leading the way.

[01:11:15.610] - Speaker 1
But especially when they'd seen Hard Day's Night, the girls knew how they were supposed to behave. They were supposed to scream and go crazy and rush us, us collectively. And they did. And the weirdest one was we were playing out of doors in one corner of a baseball thing or something. And at that time, those outdoor stages often used to be just a couple of trucks pulled out next to each other, truck beds. And so as soon as we came out, the girls jump off down from the baseball seats and running across the diamond, which they're probably all freaking out about their bloody baseball thing anyway. So they're all running. And the police said, go, go. So we jumped off. We're running to some car or whatever. I looked back, my glasses fell off on the grass. I leapt down, picked up my glasses and ran on. The girls were jumping down. I saw some girl find the place where my glasses had fallen, pulled the grass up and eat it. I went, That is so cool.

[01:12:18.480] - Speaker 2
That's commitment.

[01:12:19.410] - Speaker 1
That's commitment. She was eating the grass.

[01:12:21.820] - Speaker 2
The power of music.

[01:12:23.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. And of the Beatles, particularly. Because the whole British Invasion, Madness was Beatle-related.

[01:12:31.220] - Speaker 2
Was BeatleMania as wild before the movie, or did the movie- I think the movie showed people their moves.

[01:12:39.880] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:12:41.160] - Speaker 2
So before it might have been screaming, but- They never knew what to do. It would have been screaming, but in their seats.

[01:12:46.010] - Speaker 1
I think so, yes. Yeah, exactly. They did catch you there. Nobody knew what to do. There'll be occasions when four girls actually make it and catch you, and they stop screaming and go, Now, what do we do? What happens? Because they were all 14.

[01:13:04.800] - Speaker 2
This is a good question. This is related to something Mick Jagger said a long time ago, because the Stones are from London. He said in the early days, they didn't take the Beatles so seriously because of where they were from. He's like, nothing good comes from Liverpool.

[01:13:22.480] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[01:13:23.120] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that. Is that a real- Oh, yes.

[01:13:26.540] - Speaker 1
I don't think we thought less of them, but the weird part for us- What would be the US equivalent?

[01:13:34.160] - Speaker 2
Where would that be?

[01:13:36.020] - Speaker 1
I suppose, I don't know. Is it Pittsburgh? Yeah.

[01:13:38.850] - Speaker 2
Just the middle of nowhere.

[01:13:40.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think so. We didn't realize that until we got to America and people would go, what's Liverpool really like? I go, hardly you've ever been there. We've done a couple of gigs there, but I don't know. Everyone we knew from Liverpool, the minute they made any money, the The first thing they bought was a train ticket to London. That's where you wanted to go. That's where it was going to happen. The fact that there would be Liverpool scene, which there was, I guess. I mean, there was the cabin and some other places. But, yeah, we were puzzled and surprised by the respect and adulation that was bestowed upon Liverpool. We were, Liverpool? And they'd go, What's it like? And we go, I don't know. It's a grim port town.

[01:14:29.500] - Speaker 2
And everyone leaves. Did the Beatles have a different, or the people from Liverpool have a different accent than the people in London? Oh, yes. You could tell where they were from?

[01:14:37.270] - Speaker 1
Yes, absolutely.

[01:14:38.280] - Speaker 2
Or just a northern accent?

[01:14:41.300] - Speaker 1
No, you can tell Liverpool. Some of those accents are quite specific. When you're Liverpool compared to Newcastle, which is Jordy, let alone compared to Scottish. But yeah, there's other towns with their own accents, and Liverpool is very distinctive.

[01:14:56.110] - Speaker 2
Did you ever see the animals play?

[01:14:58.130] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:14:58.980] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that. I did.

[01:14:59.700] - Speaker 1
I can't remember where it was, but I saw them. They were terrific. Thought Eric was great. Thought Alan Price was great.

[01:15:08.150] - Speaker 2
Eric's another one. Just the voice is just so cool.

[01:15:11.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:15:12.210] - Speaker 2
He's so different than everybody else.

[01:15:14.460] - Speaker 1
He's a really nice guy. Eric and I- They're from New Castle, is that right? Yes, they are Jordies, which means you're from New Castle. Eric and I ended up in New York together at the same time. We went to see Sam Cooke at the Apollo.

[01:15:28.900] - Speaker 2
How was that?

[01:15:29.720] - Speaker 1
It was Amazing. Unbelievable. He was great. And Billy Stewart, who was great. Of course, everyone told us, Don't go. And we would, although you can't go to Harlem. We went, Yeah, we can. We're English. It's different. And we found a taxi that would take us and went to the airport, just went there and bought a ticket and went in. And it's interesting. Sam Cooke was completely fantastic. Although it's interesting because I asked Chris Blackwell once of all those performers who were so legendary, who was the best in his eyes, and it was Jackie Wilson. Wow. He said, yes, James Brown, yes, Sam Cook, but Jackie Wilson was just so riveting with the microphone stuff and the great singing and everything. I never saw him live, but I always thought that was interesting.

[01:16:24.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I got to see James Brown several times, and it was always unbelievable.

[01:16:29.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, him I saw in America and in England. I found some pictures the other day of me in the audience at Ready, Steady, Go because it was James Brown was on Ready, Steady, Go. It was me and somebody. Oh, Barry Miles, the writer. We were in the audience, and I had completely forgotten what- How radical did James Brown seem when you were in London?

[01:16:51.470] - Speaker 2
What was that like?

[01:16:53.500] - Speaker 1
We were in awe. Again, it was just part of this overall miracle of American music that we just I couldn't believe what these people could do.

[01:17:02.440] - Speaker 2
Who else we talk about? You got to work with Elton at one point?

[01:17:06.110] - Speaker 1
Yes. I've been a fan of Elton for ages. I went to the famous Troubidor show.

[01:17:13.550] - Speaker 2
Really? Yeah. How was it?

[01:17:15.320] - Speaker 1
It was great. It was amazing because I knew about him, and I think we'd already met. But somehow he ended up coming over to our house, the same one, Longwood Avenue, I was still in. He came over the next day, and that's when he met James Taylor. James was staying with me, and Elton came over with the band.

[01:17:35.460] - Speaker 2
Had he made his first album yet or no?

[01:17:37.650] - Speaker 1
Yes. This was when... Yes, he was promoting that album. He did that Trubyto show. It was a legendary place. We had James in there.

[01:17:46.680] - Speaker 2
Linda famously played there.

[01:17:48.460] - Speaker 1
Yeah, Linda played there a bunch. The bar was where everybody hung out and swapt songs and all that stuff. That's where James and I heard You've Got A Friend for the First Time. Because what happened was after I'd asked Carol to be in the band for the album, then asked her if she would come on the road for some of those dates, because up till now, James had only played the Troubador folk style completely by himself. But I wanted to do a week at the Troubadour. Now the record was out and doing well with the band, the people who played on the record. So I got Russ Kunkel and Cooch and so on. And asked Carol if she'd do it. She said, yes. And it was James' idea that she should maybe do a little opening set because he knew she was about to make her own record and said, look, she was terrified of being on her own. Said, maybe it's a way to get your feet wet thing. So would you like to do 20 minutes, half an hour, whatever you want in front of my show, just on your piano. She said, All you have to do is play the songs and tell people you wrote them because no one's going to believe it, because she looked like a 16-year-old school girl, and that's what she did.

[01:18:55.170] - Speaker 1
But on the opening day of the soundcheck, James and I were in the little balcony at the Troubadour. We stuck around just to give Carol moral support. And in order to just make sure she could hear the piano and do her soundcheck, she played the song she just finished writing the night before, and that was You've Got A Friend. And that's when James and I went, Shit, what was that? And James said, and still says it's one of the best pop songs ever written. That's when he asked her if he could learn it and sing it. That, of course, was in Sweet Baby James was already out as a hit, but tapestry hadn't been made yet. So Carol then recorded, and Carol said, yes, you can do it, but I'm going to do it on my record as well. At the same time, basically, Lou was in the studio at A&M doing her album and did a version of You've Got A Friend, and we were in the studio at a place called Crystal Sound doing our version. The only secret weapon I had was Tony Mitchell sang all the background parts. Incredible. The miracle was that it worked for everybody because You've got a James's big hit single.

[01:20:02.860] - Speaker 1
On Carol's case, it was one of the key tracks on Tapestry, which sold a gazillion billion records.

[01:20:09.240] - Speaker 2
It seemed like the fact that both versions existed seemed to help each other.

[01:20:14.320] - Speaker 1
I think so. It felt like that. Because they were different. Because I had, as I say, no piano. It was just James and Kuhch on acoustics, which was a great sound. It actually happened again on Handyman when we did that. That was an accident. Kuhch started playing the song in the studio. We were working on some other song, and Kuhch just started playing Handiman very slowly. James joined in and started playing and singing, and I went, Just a minute. We actually recorded it, just the two of them, and Russ playing a cardboard box or something, and then added the other instruments.

[01:20:51.010] - Speaker 2
I got to see James and Carol play at the Troubadour together, I don't know, five, six years ago. Yeah, exactly.Unbelievable.Yeah.Unbelievable..

[01:21:00.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was fun doing that because James was worried about it, didn't know he wanted to record it. But I said, We have to record it. Of course. History. They filmed it with only two cameras as me, but made it work. Yeah, we were up in the little booth thing, Nathaniel Kunkel and I.

[01:21:16.230] - Speaker 2
I might have been in that same booth because I was up there.

[01:21:19.980] - Speaker 1
Probably. Yes, exactly. Right, exactly.

[01:21:22.700] - Speaker 2
We were getting to Elton John?

[01:21:25.060] - Speaker 1
Yes. I saw Elton, the original Troubido show, and Yeah, as I said, he came over to our house afterwards. I've known him and liked him so much for a long time. We haven't worked together that much. I did some tracks on a Randy Newman album that Elton was on, where Elton played an angel. It was a brilliant album. Randy wrote a version of Faust, and we did this recorded version, which was really extraordinary. James Taylor played God, Randy played the Devil, Donna Lee played Faust, Linda Rontzat played The Good Girl, Bonnie Raitt played The Bad Girl, and Elton John played a English Angel. It was an insane cast. I said to Randy afterwards, You're the only person in the whole world, I think, that could actually make an album with all those people on it and have it not be a hit. It's extraordinary because Randy is such a genius, one of the great geniuses of pop music. But somehow people don't get it always. This This musical is so good, and the cast was so insane, but the public didn't quite catch on.

[01:22:37.130] - Speaker 2
It seems like there's a line between the way Elton plays piano and the way Carol King plays piano. They both have a real soulful, almost gospel influence in their styles.

[01:22:49.150] - Speaker 1
It's true. Yes, I think that's actually right. Elton's a bit more rock and roll in the sense of the hammering right-hand. But yeah, that's true.

[01:23:00.550] - Speaker 2
I think the thing that I- They're certainly mutual fans. The thing that I like about both of their music, I feel like there's some line that works. They both have that thing, and it's not a thing that most piano players have.

[01:23:14.520] - Speaker 1
I think you're right. They're also both not jazzy. God knows, I love jazz piano. I can't beat Bill Evans, but they have very little of that in their playing. It tends to be simple and not full of little extra jazzy notes or jazzy noodles at any point. I think they have that in common. They both are brilliant accomplices to themselves. They both play exactly the right part to fit their singing.

[01:23:44.000] - Speaker 2
I guess both wrote the music for other people's lyrics.

[01:23:51.490] - Speaker 1
That's right. I guess I don't actually know for a fact, did Jerry Goffin write the lyrics first?

[01:23:58.130] - Speaker 2
I don't know if he wrote them first. I don't know, but I don't know, but he certainly wrote the lyrics, and she wrote the music.

[01:24:02.440] - Speaker 1
Because what's unusual about Elton, of course, is that it's absolutely lyrics first. That he can take a piece of paper that just arrived from Bernie Taupin, stick it up on the music, and you'd swear he had-Play the song.was looking at music. You'd swear he was looking at a piece of music because he just plays it. He's written with other people brilliantly, of course, too, Tim Rice and others. But there's something magic about him and Bernie, where it's as if Elton knows the song as soon as he sees the lyrics.

[01:24:31.790] - Speaker 2
Tell me about... I never got to meet Diana Ross, but I know you got to work with her. Tell me about her.

[01:24:37.170] - Speaker 1
It was amazing. I was nervous because you hear these stories, the call me Ms. Ross and all that stuff. My impression, first of all, she's charming. I'd met her years before. I'd met her for the first time when Peter and Gordon were on Hullabaloo. The Supremes were on. To get to meet them was an immense thrill because we bought every record that came out on Motown, and they were so charming and so beautiful and so extraordinary. That was exciting. Then when Diana and I worked together, I was, as I said, a little bit nervous because of the stories one had heard. But she was helpful and charming and I had no issues or problems at all, far comment, the opposite, in fact. I remember the engineer and I at one point were sitting down, sorting out a vocal or doing something on the board, and we felt her stand up behind us. She'd been sitting in the back of the room, and we were going to go, Oh, this is it. Here we go. She said, You guys have been at this for a while. Can I get you some coffee or something? Oh, my God.

[01:25:55.260] - Speaker 1
That was memorable. But even more memorable was the very beginning of the session because I think I'd cut the track without her, as far as I can remember. But anyway, first time she goes out on mic and we're sitting in the control room and she starts singing on the mic, the only reaction is, holy shit, it sounds exactly like Diana Ross.

[01:26:14.510] - Speaker 2
It's amazing.

[01:26:15.670] - Speaker 1
That super distinct voice that sang in her Stop In The Name Of Love and stuff, which you know so well, she's right there. I could hardly contain myself. That's the thing where you don't know whether to communicate any of that to the artist, whether it's just too silly. But you don't say, I couldn't believe it, but you do say something. Yeah.

[01:26:38.640] - Speaker 2
It's almost like when you get to work with the people who you've spent so much time listening to, it's hard to believe it's happening. It's hard to believe it's actually happening.

[01:26:48.700] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[01:26:49.450] - Speaker 2
They walk the Earth.

[01:26:51.260] - Speaker 1
That's why you and I are both so extraordinarily lucky by whatever set of circumstances.

[01:26:57.480] - Speaker 2
I remember the first time I got to see Paul McCartney play live was in stadium. It was 80,000 people, something like that. I'm somewhere in the middle of 80,000 people nosebleed area, and he starts singing, and I just start crying. It's like, that person wrote these songs I've been hearing my whole life, he walks the Earth.

[01:27:19.370] - Speaker 1
It's unbelievable. Well, that's why I do feel bad for Paul because, yes, being famous can be annoying on many levels, I suppose. But I I've personally seen Paul deal with the situation where he's introduced to somebody or meets someone and they cannot speak. Yeah.literally cannot speak.It's too much. It's too much. And he ends up going, it's okay, or they cry. They can't speak and they cry. That would be disconcerting when that's a given risk of anyone you're meeting that they may not speak and they may cry. I think that must be annoying, a bit weird.

[01:27:55.830] - Speaker 2
It must be used to it by now.

[01:27:57.030] - Speaker 1
I know. You obviously figure out a policy. I've seen him pat people on the shoulder and go, It's okay. But it's odd. There's very few people in that situation. Maybe Mick, I don't know. But Paul is a one-off case that you actually- It's unbelievable. And Ringo. But Ringo, there's something more light-hearted about it. Everyone's admiration is massive. Everyone loves him because he's still the cute one, the one everyone loves. But it's not quite the same thing. But as you say, with Paul, there's that realization that legend occasionally is reality. He's a real person.

[01:28:39.410] - Speaker 2
Incredible how important every member of that band was It just fit perfectly.

[01:28:48.430] - Speaker 1
I've always said it's just perfect. It's just like it was a Spice Girls thing where someone had put them together, only much better, and nobody did. God did, if that's what you think. Fate put together. I've said that, too.

[01:29:02.800] - Speaker 2
It's like the Beatles are proof of the existence of God. It's too much. It's too much to be that good and to be that much better than everybody. There's no metric for it.

[01:29:16.230] - Speaker 1
Exactly. You're absolutely right.

[01:29:19.640] - Speaker 2
What did you get to work on with Cher?

[01:29:22.520] - Speaker 1
Some great songs, Heart of Stone, I did. After all, that duet with Peter Cetero, that was a big hit for a movie, the movie product, but the record was good. But she's great. I mean, she's working with her. She's extraordinary. She's so hard working. I remember we were working on that version of It's In His Kiss that I did with her for a Mades, which ended up being a hit everywhere except America for some bizarre reason. She was great. She'd done her homework, knew the song, everything. At that time, she used to like the track completely done as much as possible. Everything was finished. There's that first moment when you play it and you go, Oh, I hope this is okay. But it was. She went out there and sang it, did four takes or something. I said, I think we have it. That was all great. Let me piece it together. Give me a few minutes or come back, whatever you want. She said, No, wait. She goes out and in the lounge, there's the guy designing the perfume bottle, the costume fitting for the next movie, the guy writing a book about or something.

[01:30:31.070] - Speaker 1
You can suddenly realize I'm a mere aspect of the miracle that is shared because she'll become really successful as a movie star and then go, Now I want to make another record. Everyone goes, No, that won't work. She does. She wins a Grammy, so she has a number one record. Now I'm going to make a movie. It's like, Nobody else has done that, and she does it really well. I love her voice, too. Me, too. I love her voice. I love singers where you know in a bar who it is. 10 seconds of music, and you're absolutely certain that's Diana Ross, that's Cher, that's Linda Ronset, that's Natalie Merchant.

[01:31:08.470] - Speaker 2
We both got to work with Neil Diamond. What was your experience like? Tell me.

[01:31:12.360] - Speaker 1
It was great. I was always a Neil fan. I always thought he was an underrated songwriter because the whole this Neil would distract people from Neil, the solitary man genius. I love the record you did with him.

[01:31:27.990] - Speaker 2
I think of him as Bruce Springsteen before Bruce Springsteen in many ways in the early days.

[01:31:32.330] - Speaker 1
Yes. There's people now that we realize definitely are in the singer-songwriter category in the same way going back further, Buddy Holly is, who had a vision of what their songs could be. Neil has written so many so great songs. As I say, being a showbiz phenomenon as well as a musical phenomenon, something Dylan has judicially avoided to the point where it almost is showbiz that he sings every song differently. You don't know what song you're doing. No, I admire Neil enormously. He's charming and-Great singer, too. Oh, great singer. I insisted as you did, with getting him playing and singing on the track because that's the essence of the great Neil Diamond stuff. The songs are so odd. They're not shaped normally. No.

[01:32:27.420] - Speaker 2
Even when you hear the monkey songs that he wrote that you could tell it's a Neil Diamond song, so specific.

[01:32:32.200] - Speaker 1
Exactly. The hooks are all over the place. I mean, who would think that in Sweet Caroline, the hook turned it out to be the instrumental between the lines? That's the hook. Part of the hook. Everybody sings it. That's the moment of the song. Everybody knows. It's full of hooks. The chorus itself is incredibly catchy and brilliant chorus. But you never get the impression he's trying to write a hit, but it's not that hook. It's not constructed that way, but it's genuinely brilliant songwriting and some interesting lyrics twists and stuff. Again, a bit like Buddy Hollywood, who would put weird words in a weird order. I mean, true love ways What a sentence is that? But it works as a song.

[01:33:19.990] - Speaker 2
Was Buddy Holly a big inspiration as well? Yes.

[01:33:23.770] - Speaker 1
We were huge Buddy Holly fans in England. One of my regrets is that I was 14 when he toured to England. I can't remember why I didn't go. Maybe I couldn't afford it. Maybe it was exam time. My parents wouldn't let me. It got to be some mundane reason. I remember thinking, Well, I'll see him next time. No, next time. Because that would have been exciting. I'd like to be able to see. I saw Elvis in Vegas when he first Vegas come back, and that was great. But I missed buddy.

[01:33:58.180] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the experience of to see Elvis in Vegas. That sounds great. I never got to see Elvis.

[01:34:02.780] - Speaker 1
It was great. Yeah, it was really good. He was already doing all the karate stuff with all that. But it wasn't quite like mystery train Elvis, who's probably my favorite Elvis of all. But it was young and handsome and fit Elvis, and he was terrific. Sang great. Everything was fast at that particular era. The live versions were cranking it in terms of BPM, no question. Roni Tutt, the He was a great drummer, but they were racing through everything. I suppose it was just the exciting live version. I remember thinking, That's a lot faster than the record.

[01:34:39.030] - Speaker 2
And he played all the hits.

[01:34:40.460] - Speaker 1
He played all the hits.

[01:34:41.790] - Speaker 2
Talk to the audience much in between songs?

[01:34:44.460] - Speaker 1
Little jokey asides and stuff, as I recall, and sounded just like an Elvis imitation. But I don't remember him saying much. Maybe just mentioning the song or who wrote it or something like that, making fun with the band members. I remember Roni Tutt telling me because he was subsequently on one of those tours when they started doing the 3D hologram thing. Not 3D. It wasn't really hologram, even. This was the first time they used Elvis on film and playing with the band because he separated the vocals. Roni Tutt said that the weirdest part was that it was exactly like being on the road with Elvis. There was hardly any difference because they didn't see much of him on the road. He hung with his friends. They even included the thing where he introduces the band by name. He'd go on drums, Roni Tutt, and Roni Joe would stand on bow. He said it was really spooky. Amazing.

[01:35:39.750] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Steve Martin, because we didn't talk about Steve. How did it happen?

[01:35:43.690] - Speaker 1
I've known Steve Martin off and on for a long time. We kept running into each other and gradually became closer friends in the last few years. But I remember, he, for example, opened for Linda in the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach. I think I found an ad just doing stand-up. I got to know him gradually. He's always been a Banjo player I much admired. I love bluegrass Banjo, and he's really good at it. I was having dinner at his house in New York, and he was telling me that he had played me these Banjo tunes before, actually, that he'd written because he writes little instrumental pieces just for the fun of it. He'd done the instrumental music for the New York Shakespeare A Festival and things like that. But anyway, he played me some stuff and I told him how good it was. Then he said, Well, I've actually been playing some of it to Edi Brakelle, who he didn't know particularly well, even though he and Paul Simon are close friends. But he said that he'd run into Edi and played us some of these bits and pieces. She said, Oh, I love that.

[01:36:49.920] - Speaker 1
Can I write some songs on it? He said, Yes, of course. What she did was brilliant. We expected her to essentially put lyrics and melody where necessary to the existing piece of music. But what she did was write a whole other melody that made the existing piece of music sound like the perfect accompaniment. So suddenly there was the Banjo part being the accompaniment to this melody that He had written. At a subsequent dinner, he played me that and said, What do you think? I said, I think it's great. You should make an album because Edi said you're a terrific singer. He said, We should turn this into an album. He said, Oh. I was on the plane home the next day when he emailed me and said, We're going to do it. Do you want to produce it? I went, Yes, yes, yes. Great. Essentially, we did it pretty much Banjo and click. It was very much assembled I'd get the perfect Banjo bit and line things up a bit and then work on the vocal and add instruments as needed. It's essentially like a Bluegrass record. But I did things like I had Esperanza Spaulding play bass on That's what I'm saying.

[01:38:00.180] - Speaker 1
She's great. Because I loved the idea of getting some jazz bass licks under a bluegrass Banjo, which she loved as well because there's some odd notes in there with the drone and things which the bass has to account for. Then I put some percussion on it, some strings in some instances. It's not like a full-on bluegrass record. Steve and Edy were cool. I was doing all that on my own. They were happy.

[01:38:24.700] - Speaker 2
Great.

[01:38:25.220] - Speaker 1
Paul was happy, which counts for a lot because Edy's... If your client's is one of the best songwriters and record producers of all time, you do go, Have you played it in the kitchen? The answer is yes.

[01:38:40.070] - Speaker 2
I haven't heard his new album yet. I hear it's great.

[01:38:42.830] - Speaker 1
I bet it is. I hear it's great. They're always amazing. His last one was great. Yeah, so that was exciting. Edie's breathtaking, incredibly in tune, brilliant phrasing, very original. Again, totally idiosyncratic in delivery. You know right away who it is. She has this little band with Steve Gadd, The Gadd About. It's great. I didn't know that. That sounds so good. They made an album or two just for the fun of it, I think. I forget who else is in the... Oh, Pina Palladino.

[01:39:14.300] - Speaker 2
Oh, he's in Incredible.

[01:39:15.250] - Speaker 1
There's a killer bass band. Incredible. And Steve Gatt and- Have you heard Pino's solo album?

[01:39:22.560] - Speaker 2
It's ridiculously beautiful. I haven't. You'll love it. It's out. Beautiful.

[01:39:27.010] - Speaker 1
I will listen.

[01:39:28.130] - Speaker 2
It's him and Blake Mills together. It's so good.

[01:39:31.180] - Speaker 1
Oh, great.

[01:39:32.390] - Speaker 2
It's so good.

[01:39:33.460] - Speaker 1
I'll listen to that for sure. Yeah.

[01:39:35.130] - Speaker 2
Really adventurous, really jazzy.

[01:39:37.650] - Speaker 1
Great. Yeah, he's extraordinary.

[01:39:40.320] - Speaker 2
I love that D'Angelo Voodoo album, and he's the bass player on that. Oh, right.

[01:39:44.760] - Speaker 1
It's unlike everything. De Angela is incredible. Yeah.

[01:39:48.130] - Speaker 2
Great album.

[01:39:49.220] - Speaker 1
Cool.

[01:39:49.890] - Speaker 2
Cool, man. Well, thank you so much for doing this. It's a pleasure talking about everything.

[01:39:52.840] - Speaker 1
No, it's a pleasure. No, anytime you want more, I can ramble on forever. Fun. It's good. It's your pleasure to talk.
