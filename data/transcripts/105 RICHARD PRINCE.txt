[00:00:06.320] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. I got to New York in '74, and in '77, I made a breakthrough. But for about 10 years to '87, nothing. I mean, I had shows and I had artist friends, and my audience- What was that first breakthrough? It was now they call it refotography. Oh, yeah. It was just simply me.

[00:00:44.490] - Speaker 2
Did they call it refotography or you call it? I did. Okay.

[00:00:46.660] - Speaker 1
It was a very awkward term at the time because I was trying to figure out what I was doing. Basically, I picked up a camera and I tried to play it as if it as an instrument because I didn't know anything about it. I had no clue about how to work a camera. But I thought, well, all my friends are picking up guitars and they don't know how to play the guitar, but they're going to see the jibies and And within a week, they got a gig. So maybe I could do the same thing with the camera. And I called it an electronic scissor, meaning if I looked at another image through the viewfinder, let's just say if I tore out an advertising image of a cowboy, the Marmer, and I pushpint it to the wall and then stood, put my camera in front of it and looked through the lens and cropped. And two things would happen. I could look through the viewfinder at 10: 00 in the morning and come back at 4: 00 in the afternoon, and I would see basically the same thing. Nothing has changed. So the whole idea of the decisive moment completely eradicated.

[00:02:13.890] - Speaker 2
So then it's a new form of photography.

[00:02:15.810] - Speaker 1
The other thing was the idea of the electronic scissor. Instead of tearing the page out of the magazine and scotch taping or cutting it and pasting it collaging, I made a real photograph. It wasn't a collage anymore. There were no scenes.

[00:02:40.510] - Speaker 2
It was a new piece that didn't exist before.

[00:02:43.570] - Speaker 1
It was a real photograph. Yeah. Those two things happened, but it took a while because I didn't know what I was doing. I started writing about it. But my audience at the time, we were just a few artists who dug it and thought it was interesting.

[00:03:03.190] - Speaker 2
Tell me how you felt about it at the time. Did you think it was interesting?

[00:03:09.840] - Speaker 1
I thought it was new. I thought it was interesting because Well, the photography part of the art world completely rejected it. And I was also picking images that weren't necessarily esthetically pleasing, advertising much. Because I was working at Time Life magazine, and they published seven magazines at the time. And when I would come in Mondays, there would always be a set of the new magazines. I would be excited then because I would go through the magazine and say, well, maybe there's a new cowboy or maybe there's a new watch. Because my job was to tear up the magazines and give the editorial, which they call a hard copies. And at the end of the day, all I was left with were these images of advertisements. But nobody called for them. And I kept looking at them thinking, well, there's no real author. Who's the author behind? These are art-directed images. And they're very real. They have a virtuoso reality that's so real that it's unreal. It's something I didn't really need to think about the meaning. They didn't really have. I I just could organize them. I think it was what it was a William Gibson, some pattern recognition.

[00:04:39.910] - Speaker 1
And I would notice there was a lot of watch ads, a lot of pens, perfume. And so I would just start to rephotograph what was plentiful, what was always there. I wasn't on a treasure hunt. It was just whatever was presented It was interesting to me that week.

[00:05:01.680] - Speaker 2
Did you call it refotography right away?

[00:05:04.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I did. But what's interesting, too, is that at first I was calling what I was doing pirating because I was very aware of what was going on with sampling. It had just started. But I thought I didn't really was comfortable with appropriation. That seemed a little academic. But I also ran into other artists who are also working with images. So that was important to me, too, to become friends with other people that had that sensibility of growing up at a particular time.

[00:05:46.960] - Speaker 2
Do you think it's just the nature of the time and the place and the way information comes at you that other people see? They don't see what you see the way you see it, but they are looking at the same thing and then having their own interpretation of how to deal with this information.

[00:06:03.180] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. I think we were the first generation to grow up with television. There was always television, magazine, movies. At least if you ask the artists that I came up with, they would probably have a very similar experience.

[00:06:23.660] - Speaker 2
If you think before television and magazines, there wasn't really a place for advertising. Advertising was a new thing.

[00:06:35.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It certainly was, for me, it was a conceptual thing, too. How do you frame this particular type of thing, this product. And I was always interested in the concept of, for instance, the guy that presented the cowboy to Marlborough was a guy named Leo Burnet. And in 1949, the year I was born, this guy, Lacombe, this photographer, did an essay on cowboys. And And the cover of life, if you look at that cover, it looks like a Marlborough, like a Marlborough guy. So that was in '49. And this guy, Leo Burnet, I think, pitched the idea to Mora Burrow in '53. He wanted a more masculine deal. So all this was very conceptual. And I liked reading about the background of all this. It was interesting to me because I was living inside of a giant novel in time life. The building itself became the incubator. It had its own hospital, cafeteria, a bookstore. Where was it? Where is it located? It was right across from Radio City Musical. Cool. I basically haunted that place, went to the archives. I would go and do research. But yeah, time life was my studio.

[00:08:19.910] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:08:21.130] - Speaker 1
Because I didn't have a studio.

[00:08:23.640] - Speaker 2
No, but it's amazing, the resources and the information.

[00:08:27.070] - Speaker 1
I actually looked forward. I had a stupid job job, of course. It was just a bullshit job, turning up the magazine. But I actually... And I had to have something to pay the... I had a crappy little apartment in the East Village. But I had to have something to pay the rent. But I I really didn't really mind going there because it that's where it happened, really, for me. For some reason, there was this thing going on where artists were documenting what they did in photographic and then narrative form, and they would be pasting it up on these pieces of cardboard, and that's what they would show. And there was a gallery called John Gibson that was dedicated to this way of working. And I really hung out at that gallery. I really was a pastor, Do you need coffee? I mean, I would do anything. And I became friends with the wife's owner, and she tolerated my presence on Saturdays. But Vito Aconci would show there, and Dennis Oppenheim, But then there were these other people, James Collins and Peter Hutchinson, and they call it narrative art. But they used photography. They weren't photographers in that.

[00:09:58.600] - Speaker 1
So that was That's a stepping stone also. So I think the two, the combination of that gallery and then the time life experience. I remember there were four advertisements in the New York Times magazine section that came out, I think, of living rooms. There's a really dumb-looking, generic- Like from a Sears catalog.

[00:10:28.820] - Speaker 2
What would look you'd see in a Sears catalog? A model living room.

[00:10:33.120] - Speaker 1
Like from a sitcom. Yeah.

[00:10:35.120] - Speaker 2
Nothing that anyone would ever actually live in.

[00:10:37.870] - Speaker 1
But apparently, that's what people did.

[00:10:41.250] - Speaker 2
Hard to know.

[00:10:41.920] - Speaker 1
It wasn't like I looked at them as some alien or a sci-fi or social science fiction. I just thought, this isn't something that if I put this up at a gallery, I don't know if I'm going to get away with this. I don't I don't know if people are going to like it because I don't know if I even liked it. And I felt very uncomfortable. And it visually, it wasn't very inviting. It wasn't beautiful. But there was something that I needed to do. But what was my contribution? How was I transformatively? And that's where the camera came in. That's where the camera really surrounded the living room when I looked through the lens. It was absorbing.

[00:11:40.030] - Speaker 2
I was going to say the nature photography also adds, you can call it a filter or- adds a truth.

[00:11:48.340] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:11:49.840] - Speaker 2
It's in music, sometimes if you have equipment with tubes, it's more pleasant to listen to the sound through the tubes. You could say In a way, it's more truthful, but in a way, it's more colored. It's more beautiful than what the musician heard. The tube is doing its thing. And photography can do that in films. You can see technicolor. Obviously, technicolored is not what the world looks like. It's beautiful.

[00:12:19.910] - Speaker 1
You know that these images are highly art-directed after the image is taken, too. On all the prep work that goes in before they're published. But the idea of presenting these living rooms as a standalone photograph Which then I presented as normally as possible, just like other photography. I'm mad at it, framed it.

[00:12:58.590] - Speaker 2
Just ordinary.

[00:12:59.290] - Speaker 1
Very It was the content that was radical. And I remember when I first exhibited, people would look at them and they weren't quite Sure, is this... It wasn't even a question of, Is this your photograph? Or who took? I mean, what? What is it? It's just like, what? And that's what I was... That was the reaction that I received that I got. But I knew that that was a reaction that no one else was getting from their work. And I felt that, yeah, maybe this is a little different.

[00:13:47.560] - Speaker 2
Did your opinion of it change after you showed it? Did you have a deeper understanding of it when you showed it?

[00:13:53.130] - Speaker 1
A little bit. I remember trying to, is there a way to make them more beautiful. I remember thinking about that because at first I was not only... I mean, the living rooms, there were always more than one. I mean, one, you might not believe, but you have to believe that if there's four of them.

[00:14:22.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, four different living rooms, different furniture.

[00:14:26.060] - Speaker 1
You have to believe that this does exist. I was always trying to take the speculation out of the work, the idea of the guessing, the umpiring, the judgment. I was trying to take as much interpretation and put as much non-fiction into the work as I could. The idea of made it into a real photograph, I believe, well, photographs, you tend to believe a photograph.

[00:14:56.690] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a photograph is non-fiction. But interesting, what you're photographing photographing is fiction.

[00:15:01.460] - Speaker 1
It was until I rephotographed it.

[00:15:04.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but it was real furniture, but it was art-directed in a way where it was not someone's living room, likely. It was likely a set. But when you photographed it, then it became real.

[00:15:19.630] - Speaker 1
Then it had this virtuosa reality to it. I think at the time, what was in the air at the time, run '77, It was this idea of what's real, what's not real. That was the big question. Who do I believe in? Or what do I believe?

[00:15:37.790] - Speaker 2
What else can you remember that was going on in '77?

[00:15:40.190] - Speaker 1
Well, I thought the pump thing was Sex Pistols would have been '77. Yeah. I thought '77 was a year in which I thought a lot of things in the art world were beginning My generation was just starting with getting their chops together and just starting to have the opportunity to maybe form collectives and show each other what they were up to, and then maybe even showing publicly in alternative spaces. And I think the conceptual and the minimalists and the post studio, we were winding down. But I think back at any time during, at least in my experience, the There's always three or four, maybe even five things going on at the same time, different types of styles or different types of scenes. I belonged, for a lack of a term, they call us the picture generation. And I was hanging around with that crowd.

[00:17:06.240] - Speaker 2
Who else was in that group?

[00:17:07.140] - Speaker 1
Well, people like Cindy Sherman, people like Troy Brontë, Robert Longo. Jack Goldstein was a very important. He was a little older than us, but he was a guy named James Welling. Barbara Kruger was a really good friend of mine at the time. And I'm not sure what happens now in the art world, but I don't know if people get together. But it's one of the things that I remember. I mean, luck has a lot to do with all of this. But I think I was very lucky because when I came to New York in '74, I came for the idea of staying for three months, and it just turned into forever. I just kept How did you come with the idea of becoming a fine artist? Well, I was already making work, very traditional.

[00:18:09.060] - Speaker 2
Tell me before that, how did you come to the idea of this is what you want to do as a kid?

[00:18:13.160] - Speaker 1
I was always I was always interested in making art, drawing as a child. When people say people can play the piano by ear, I think they call it, I was able to draw I could sit down with a pencil and draw a portrait of my grandfather or my sister, or whoever was around. And I could make it look like without any... I could do that when I was nine. It was just or something natural. I never really thought about it. I never had to. Never even gave it a second thought. But I got really sidetracked into wanting to become a musician. I mean, that was my first.

[00:19:02.480] - Speaker 2
Do you play an instrument?

[00:19:03.650] - Speaker 1
I do. I have over the years played in little bands. I mean, every artist, we were all in bands and everything like that.

[00:19:15.960] - Speaker 2
What instrument do you play?

[00:19:17.670] - Speaker 1
I play a little piano and a little guitar. It always seemed with the music thing, I didn't like the idea of performing or being having I mean, to do it public. The idea of collaboration wasn't a big thing with me. The idea of acting or having that shtick on stage has never appealed to me. I'd always thought I'd hit a wall. I always hit a wall with the... Even the idea of playing the guitar, I could only go so far. With the art, there's never been a problem with that. There's never been a stop. Things just come out of that, and they still do. It's great. It's very strange how... And I go back.

[00:20:18.440] - Speaker 2
So you might go back to rephotographing.

[00:20:21.690] - Speaker 1
I rephotograph. I still rephotograph. I still occasionally, I'm trying to make a new cowboy type of image. Great. I'd never given up on the jokes. The jokes are just endless subject matter.

[00:20:34.790] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of the jokes. How did it start?

[00:20:37.130] - Speaker 1
I wanted to draw again. This is like '85. I moved into a house was musicians. They were friends of mine, and they were trying to make music. But I wanted to draw again because I had given up drawing. I'd given up anything associated with the hand. I had read things that always not associated with anything with the hand anymore. And I said, well, maybe I'll turn that around. So I decided I wanted to draw. But what do you draw? That's the thing. For me, subject matter is first, interpretation or how to do it is second. So going through all these magazines, I always loved the cartoons, whether it was in Playboy, New York, or Easy Ryder had some really great cartoons. And I said, I'm going to draw something that's already been drawn. Again, I didn't want to make things up. I had this idea.

[00:21:37.970] - Speaker 2
I didn't want to- You were documenting something that's already in the world.

[00:21:40.600] - Speaker 1
I didn't want it to start with me.

[00:21:45.270] - Speaker 2
I wanted it to start out. Do you know what it is about that? It's interesting.

[00:21:49.690] - Speaker 1
Because I wanted it to be believed. I want to believe what I look at. I wanted people to believe what they looked at when they were looking at what I did. But if it came from me, if I said, Oh, I dreamt this, why would anyone believe that? I was interested in the truth. So again, if I could just take as much interpretation out of it and the idea of the critic or the judge or the umpire weighing in. I didn't need that. I didn't want that. Subjectivity was something I wasn't interested in. It had always been associated with art. I wanted to go beyond that. So the idea of drawing something that was already drawn, oh, cartoons are drawn. So I just redrew my favorite. This guy named Whitney Darrow was one of my favorite cartoonists. So I redrew it. But I knew what to do and how to do it because I... Craft, unfortunately, it makes it easier if you know a little bit about the craft. I knew you could spend years in an art supply store just picking up paper. But I knew what paper to use. I knew what what press Darsh was.

[00:23:17.140] - Speaker 1
I knew a number 4B pencil. I knew exactly what to use right away, and I could just do it that day.

[00:23:25.680] - Speaker 2
So very little experimentation.

[00:23:28.430] - Speaker 1
I just redrew the cartoon And you draw at scale, same size? About this big.

[00:23:36.720] - Speaker 2
And the original was smaller?

[00:23:39.320] - Speaker 1
Yes, a little bit. And it was a spot on reproduction, but it was hand-drawn. Even the punchline. But the thing was, I called them jokes.

[00:23:55.470] - Speaker 2
But they were comics?

[00:23:56.990] - Speaker 1
They were cartoons, yeah. And I realized after a while. So I would send, and it was funny. I sent these cartoons to this guy in Chicago, and lo and behold, I would get a check in the mail for $3,500. Astounding to me because none of my art ever sold. These were the very first things.

[00:24:22.030] - Speaker 2
Is that true? So up until this point, nothing sold?

[00:24:24.930] - Speaker 1
I mean, nothing. The cowboys, when they were first shown, nothing. Nothing. Ever. None of the photographs were shown. So I sent them to this guy, Hudson, who had a gallery in Chicago. And he didn't have a show. He just sold them. I said, This is great. This is unbelievable.

[00:24:44.990] - Speaker 2
Were you operating under the assumption that nothing would ever sell at that point? Of course.

[00:24:49.620] - Speaker 1
I was trying to find jobs.

[00:24:51.190] - Speaker 2
How many years has it been?

[00:24:52.390] - Speaker 1
It had been since 1970, 1970, 1970, 1970, 1971. I was making drawings, and But long story short, I was calling them jokes, and I realized it's not a joke. If I wanted a joke, and again, this is what happens. I said to myself, I've got to drop the image and just concentrate on the punchline.

[00:25:19.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because you're calling them jokes. You also could have gone the other way and decide to call them cartoons, but you didn't do that.

[00:25:26.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And then I had this Did you feel like the fact that you were calling them jokes was like a clue?

[00:25:34.560] - Speaker 2
No, but it also was like an arrow.

[00:25:38.790] - Speaker 1
And the arrow hit. So 85 turns into 86. I was invited back to the ICP, International Center for Photography, to give a lecture on my-A photography.

[00:25:53.540] - Speaker 2
I thought they don't like you. Yeah.

[00:25:56.890] - Speaker 1
And I get there, and there's a fucking line around the block. I'm thinking there's going to be, what, five or six people? And what I don't realize is that, apparently, of course, I'd had shows in New York, but there was a little bit of an underground audience for the work. And so we're talking about maybe eight years into this practice that people wanted to find out more. And, of course, it was organized by a very good friend of mine, Marvin Heiferman, who was the first guy to show the photographs. And of course, I have a panic attack, and I can hardly go in. I mean, I just flipped out. And I had subleted my apartment. I go back to my apartment. I got a call from this gallerist I wanted to come over for a studio visit. And I said to the woman, I said, I don't have a studio, but I'd love to come to your gallery. And the next thing I know, I move in. I move into the gallery. They have a back room, which I took over. And I started buying joke magazines. I remember going to the and I'd go to the humor section.

[00:27:32.640] - Speaker 1
I started checking out all these jokes.

[00:27:35.370] - Speaker 2
It was important that you would never write a joke?

[00:27:38.550] - Speaker 1
No, not at that point.

[00:27:40.360] - Speaker 2
It had to be found material. Did you have to like the joke or was it something else?

[00:27:46.640] - Speaker 1
The joke in the end had to be... It was a way of... For me, it was a way of surviving. It was serious. It was the way I think they were written, too. Jokes are very strange sentences, the way they're... The structure of the sentence. The structure of the sentence is very different from other sentences. My father was always drinking. He saw a sign that says, Drink Canada Drive. So he went up there. That's the joke. Canada Drive. And that's a very weird sentence.

[00:28:23.940] - Speaker 2
Awkward.

[00:28:24.540] - Speaker 1
Awkward. And I was very much into comedians, too. I think they're really important. It's no doubt in my mind, at least for me, they were important. Me too. Who were your favorites? Well, I mean, Lenny Bruce, obviously, Richard Prior, Dick Gregory was a big... I just found that Bob Newhart 1959 album, the Button Down, which became a huge...

[00:28:55.790] - Speaker 2
Had a good time.

[00:28:56.850] - Speaker 1
But I loved all the comedians I used to watch as a kid on Ed Sullivan, Jackie Carter, Jackie Vernon. I loved all the Borch Belt. Rodney Dangerfield is perhaps maybe the biggest comedian for me. I mean, George Collins is a genius. Rodney is special. Rodney is very special. I managed finally, after about 10 years, negotiating with his wife to buy his archive.

[00:29:27.390] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:29:28.780] - Speaker 1
I I bought Milton Burle at an estate sale, his archive. I managed to buy all his jokes were written on these card files, and they were organized by- Subject.

[00:29:42.330] - Speaker 2
Yeah, great.

[00:29:44.230] - Speaker 1
When you asked me about the straight arrow.

[00:29:47.730] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:29:49.420] - Speaker 1
Because to me, the joke was like the refotography for me, and I never thought it make another breakthrough.

[00:30:00.000] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:30:00.920] - Speaker 1
But the cartoons were okay. It was the idea of redrawing something that was already drawn. But when I got to New York and I never went back to California, I just left all my stuff and I moved into this gallery and she gave me this back room as a studio because I didn't have a studio. I said, How do I deal with the jokes? And so I decided first to write them by hand because, again, I wasn't associated. I would write them in my own handwriting, and I would pick jokes that were fairly autobiographical. So it was like self-tortrait. It was like self-portrait. That's all. Very simple idea.

[00:30:47.340] - Speaker 2
Jokes that related to you or your life.

[00:30:50.340] - Speaker 1
It's like I should have written that joke. But it's okay. I don't have to. It's already been written. I I'll write it again. And I'll put it on an 11 by 14 coded stock. I went down to this warehouse on Broadway, just spent days looking for the right piece of paper. I ended up with this 11 by 14 coded stock. And I wrote out... The first joke was I went to a psychiatrist. He said, Tell me everything I did. So he's doing my act. And I didn't get it. I I just... But the idea... Where do I locate myself in that joke? Am I the psychiatrist? Am I the patient? And the idea of doing my act. Of course. And what is my act at this point? Exactly. And it was the perfect joke. What is my act? And I realized I don't have an act. So what is the psychiatrist even talking about doing my act? Now he's doing my act? Yeah. I have. Oh, so I have an act? Yeah. Anyway, I write it out and I pinned it to the wall and I said to myself, can I do this? That's the question.

[00:32:16.180] - Speaker 1
It's not getting away with it. Can I invite someone up and say, This is my work?

[00:32:25.220] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:32:26.310] - Speaker 1
This little, very modest, Ten dollars. That's the price that I put on the joke, the very first one.

[00:32:36.590] - Speaker 2
The jokes were the first thing that sold. You said the guy in Chicago sold.

[00:32:40.750] - Speaker 1
Sold, yeah. Then I stayed in New York. At the time, I was looking for any job I could support myself with. And I knew I wasn't going to make it with the jokes, but I felt that I had to do this. It was funny. The feeling I had was if I had walked into a gallery and I had seen someone put handwritten jokes up on a wall and called them Their Art. I would have been jealous. When I have that feeling, I know that's where the arrow shouldn't be pointing. I said, well, wait a minute. I don't have to be jealous. I'm the one who's doing it.

[00:33:28.070] - Speaker 2
It actually happened.

[00:33:28.980] - Speaker 1
It happened It didn't very organically. It didn't happen overnight, obviously. It happened because I was drawing and miscalling the cartoon's jokes. Also, I had never seen this subject matter or even the radicality of the funneling of the information down to this little piece of paper. But yet the telling, tell me everything. That joke I mean, yeah, I'm going to tell you everything. And I just started ripping with the idea of the joke, and it just became, okay, let's paint. And another artist, of course, would have maybe done something very crazy in terms of materials and how it was presented. My idea was that the subject matter was radical. I didn't need to radicalize how it was presented.

[00:34:33.580] - Speaker 2
Presented it in an ordinary way.

[00:34:35.240] - Speaker 1
So I decided what's more ordinary than stretchers, canvas, and paint? Completely everyday. And then I decided to learn how to silk screen because silk screen at that point was a dead medium. Warhol had exhausted it. I was a huge fan, of course, of Warhol, but he had exhausted it. There was only one silk screening company left in New York that was on Verick Street, and there were no more silk screen inks because they were outlawed because they were so toxic. So the only silk screening were hobby inks, which when you use them, they would fade away in three months. They would disappear. And of course, that's what happened to some of my jokes. When you talk about collectors, I had a collector call me up three months after he bought one of my jokes. I said, Richard, the joke has disappeared. And I said, well, I'll give you an option. And it's funny. This guy was Albert Brooks's brother, the comedian's brother. Actually, he was one of the funniest. And he ran an ad agency. And he was one of the funniest guys I'd ever I never met Albert Brooks, but his brother was a big time Los Angeles collector, calls me up, Joke's disappeared.

[00:36:07.000] - Speaker 1
It's a ghost. And I said, well, tell you what, I'll buy it back. But there are only four of those. And He said, I use magic ink, disappearing ink. I completely like bullshit. They were supposed to do this. But I said, don't worry. I'll buy it back because there's only four. Of course, that's what collectors want to hear, I suppose. I don't know.

[00:36:34.880] - Speaker 2
It's like the stamp that's printed upside down.

[00:36:38.850] - Speaker 1
I was doing my act.

[00:36:40.000] - Speaker 2
It's more collectible.

[00:36:40.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. I was doing my act on the phone.

[00:36:45.580] - Speaker 2
It's a question I had for you. If you had a choice of buying a Monet, signed by Monet, or a Monet, signed by Picasso, which one do you want?

[00:36:54.690] - Speaker 1
I'm probably the one by Picasso. Me too. I think you're getting Especially if it's an homage. Yeah, it's an interesting question. But yeah, I agree. I don't want to buy Picasso.

[00:37:10.270] - Speaker 2
It's interesting. I was thinking about, I know you've published well-known books Oh, yeah. That you have authored.

[00:37:18.680] - Speaker 1
Catcher in the Rye.

[00:37:19.500] - Speaker 2
Catcher in the Rye, written by Richard Prince. Yeah.

[00:37:23.220] - Speaker 1
It's funny. That book, we took it to a number of printing presses. They wouldn't do it. I wouldn't But it was very litigious. Yes, exactly. So I think it was published finally in China. I'm not sure. A really good friend of mine, John McQuinnie, who has since passed away, He was a bookseller. He operated in what I call the gray area, meaning he sold first editions and he sold art that had a little to do with book art. He was trying to marry the two when he unfortunately passed away. But he was the guy who got that off the ground and saw that. And when we got the feel of that book, when you pick it up, I mean, I'm a bibliophile, which I guess I like books more than people. I guess that's the definition. When we got the book back from when it was first published, I could feel the weight, the paper, the dust jacket, everything was perfect. I'm trying to think what was different about. I think the only thing that was different was I doubled the price of what a normal catcher in the rye would sell for in a Burns & Noble.

[00:38:49.750] - Speaker 1
That's what was different. Other than that, it's this acceptance as Richard Prince.

[00:38:58.390] - Speaker 2
Is it only on the cover or inside I do?

[00:39:00.610] - Speaker 1
Like on the page, the author's page? I think it's Richard Prince. I think we removed. On the back of the first edition of a real Catherine Rye is the image of Salinger. He hated that image and had it removed. So we didn't publish it either. But it's funny. Getting back to Dangerfield, I saw Sold that book outside of Dangerfields on a blanket. I have pictures, and I think Chris Rock is in the window looking out his poster or something like that. Amazing. There was a park bench in Central Park where I would go and sell these types of certain situations, and it would get around town that, oh, he's there. And people would... I I did that recently with Ted Kuzinski's book. I managed to buy the only copy of his biography that he wanted published, but his brother stopped it. So the manuscript became available to me. I don't know how, but I bought it called Truth versus Lies or something. Anyway, we published it. I didn't ask permission or we just did it. The same thing with never got in trouble with Katcher. To this day, there's been no repercussions, no repercussions with the Kisinski.

[00:40:39.800] - Speaker 1
Lots of trouble, though, subsequently with the problem with this idea of taking things that are out in public first, where you see them out there. I feel like they have the idea of something that's I've already been seen by other people other than myself.

[00:41:06.450] - Speaker 2
It's already in the public.

[00:41:08.820] - Speaker 1
For some reason, I need that. I don't know why in terms of my subject matter. Because I feel like it can make a connection.

[00:41:17.840] - Speaker 2
I think- Maybe it's some deniability because the content is not coming from you. You're the author of the work, but you can't take responsibility for the thing that's underneath. Do you know what I mean? It's like if you took a picture of a person and that person goes out and kills somebody, that has nothing to do with you. You took the picture of it. You were a step removed from it.

[00:41:41.600] - Speaker 1
Well, the idea of taking a picture of someone, I actually, in the mid '80s, I had an idea of how to take your portrait, and it was basically you would give me five pictures of yourself that you liked.

[00:41:56.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:41:57.470] - Speaker 1
Give them to me. Yeah. I would I would look at them and I would pick one. I would rephotograph it, and that would be your portrait.

[00:42:05.200] - Speaker 2
Done by you.

[00:42:06.100] - Speaker 1
Perfect. By me. I felt two things happened there.

[00:42:11.810] - Speaker 2
Well, a couple of things. Everybody's happy with that arrangement. That's a great arrangement.

[00:42:15.680] - Speaker 1
You don't have to come and sit for me. You're not going to be disappointed. No.

[00:42:20.920] - Speaker 2
You really like all five.

[00:42:22.290] - Speaker 1
You like all five. It's great. There's a a time war. You could give me a picture when you were 14 years old. It's a great idea. Avedon can't do that. It's a great Now, I thought I actually, when I wasn't making any money, and this was '84, this is actually how I was working with Aerof. That's how I got to the archive. Because then I started going through the archive of Warner Brothers, and I did Dede Ramone. I did the B-52s. I did Laurie Anderson, I did David Byrne, Brian Eno, whoever was on the label. But I had permission, and they owned the car, and I wouldn't get in any trouble with with that. But I actually thought this could be a business, but it still can. I'm very bad at business, but it didn't work out, unfortunately. But it was a great... I thought it was an interesting way to take someone's portrait. There's a bunch of them that are out floating around in the Ether out there from 84. But the other weird thing in photography that I did, which no other photographer had done, I made additions of two.

[00:43:33.410] - Speaker 2
Why two?

[00:43:34.390] - Speaker 1
Because it was still a reproduction. Not much of a reproduction, but because the natural- Most photographers do 200 And then you're 50. I remember Maplethorpe. We had become friends before he passed away. He was always complaining to me about... I said, Well, Robert, first of all, you make a lot of photographs, but you make big additions. He says, Yeah, why do you only make two? I said, Well, I started that with the Cowboys, even though it didn't sell. But I knew the idea of two was a great It was also a way of not subverting, but dealing with the photography's naturalness. The camera has a lot of things that just go along, whether it's retouching. I would always use a commercial lab, and they all had their own way of describing the process. I would use those terms sometimes to describe the It was dark because it was real. Yeah, it was technical. I didn't want to make anything up. Or at least my way of making things up was different. That's all.

[00:44:54.730] - Speaker 2
The idea of two is really interesting, and it also elevates elevates photography through scarcity. Do you know, when you can make as many as you want, it can't be worth as many as if there's only two.

[00:45:09.600] - Speaker 1
I remember buying a George Tice photograph, and it was like the 250th copy of this particular image. And it was like, no. And most of my what I would call straight photography friends, not that I had that Not many, but they would have huge additions. I mean, I don't mind. That's their business.

[00:45:38.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you're doing a different model.

[00:45:39.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, it just had to be... I just thought it was cool in 1980 when I started the Cowboys. I had been doing additions of 10, but then I realized, well, none of them were selling. So what was the point? But so then I said, well, let's try two. Maybe, again, the scarcity would help.

[00:46:07.030] - Speaker 2
Then back to the jokes, it started with you did it by hand, and then it turned into silk screen, and then is that the end of it?

[00:46:14.900] - Speaker 1
No, then it became stency and painting. Then I started reintroducing the cartoon on top of the joke. I would put a joke that had nothing to do with the cartoon. I see. So the cartoon, I would pick... There There are certain situations that cartoonists use all the time. And one of them was a woman walking in on an infidelity. That's a standard. So what I would do is I would put that as the cartoon. But the joke underneath had nothing to do with the situation. So you would read the text and say it didn't make any sense. So I would do that. That's how I reintroduced the cartoon.

[00:46:57.410] - Speaker 2
Really interesting.

[00:46:58.790] - Speaker 1
Really interesting. I did that for a while. Then I did some abstract paintings and put a panel attached a panel under the abstraction and Hannah wrote a joke. Didn't silk screen. I just wrote it out again. Did that for a while. So '87 is when the galleries came knocking because they And I realized, well, this guy's got maybe 10... I mean, I know what their motivation was, backlog. And there was an article in one of the art magazines, published an article. So the phone started ringing because of this one article. I was completely like, gumfounded. So people started visiting me in that little room. Anyway, gallery came made me an offer. I went with the gallery. And it's funny, our first show, the woman, the gallery, I didn't tell her anything about the joke paintings. She thought she was getting a photography. And when I brought the work to the first show, she says, What are these? I said, Well, this is my new work.

[00:48:26.560] - Speaker 2
This is a new work? Yeah.

[00:48:28.120] - Speaker 1
She said, Well, where are the photographs? I I'm not doing photographs. So there was a bit of a... That's great. There was a bit of an impasse there because we had settled on, in those days, what they call a stipend, which is, I don't know if they have those anymore, but you would get a certain amount of money every month, supposedly against sales, like what they do with...

[00:48:56.540] - Speaker 2
Music business as well. Yeah, music business.

[00:48:57.420] - Speaker 1
And So she was a little surprised. Here, I'm giving you this stuff. What am I supposed to do with these, by the way? I said, well, they're jokes. And I like that idea that if anything else, I started doing an act. I would tell people, I would say, I like that joke or I like this work. And I would say, well, what do you like the painting or you're like the joke. I would start to mess with people. Because the other thing that would happen is you'd walk into a guy and people would be laughing, which didn't really happen in most shows. So a lot of weird things happened because of the subject. And of course, then in Europe, where if you couldn't speak, it would be the abstract. I would say, well, it's abstract. It's abstract art. It's perfect. You can just look at it. When I started the silk screen, I started to pick two strange colors, one background, and then the joke would be screen with a very stringy... And I felt that the color was the cartoon. It was a substitute for this. It was representational. So the colors became very important.

[00:50:28.920] - Speaker 1
And after a while, Well, I did this thing where I would only work with 18 jokes, like a routine. I mean, I was really-That was your act. That was really thinking about these things.

[00:50:42.790] - Speaker 2
Would you do multiple of the 18 or no? But only 18 and-I would do it, yeah, but different scale.

[00:50:48.830] - Speaker 1
Sometimes it would be small. Sometimes the same joke, like the psychiatrist joke, was done a lot over the years, but in different ways.

[00:51:00.050] - Speaker 2
Because that's like one of your hit songs, that joke.

[00:51:02.960] - Speaker 1
That's like the hit song. Exactly. Yeah. But I wouldn't have a hit song until... To tell you the truth, even though I was very lucky in the sense that it's not as if I haven't had museum shows and all that, which it's okay. I mean, I'm not a big fan of being curated. But in talking about a hit show, I didn't have a hit show until I did... I don't know if you're familiar with the Instagram portraits. I am. That was the first show that was, I felt, broke out outside the art world. Wow. And that was a new territory and new things to deal with, which I hadn't ever dealt with before. I'd always been inside world. Yeah. Just 25 people were my audience, I felt. I was never expecting to make art that would be on the news. That was preposterous. That's not something that I would want or even... It's never occurred to me.

[00:52:29.110] - Speaker 2
But It's not realistic.

[00:52:31.010] - Speaker 1
No, it's not. And you can't plan that. You can't. You could try. I mean, a lot of artists probably try. But anyway, that just happens. And I didn't even... At the time when I did the Instagram portion, portraits. I was on Instagram for the first time.

[00:52:49.710] - Speaker 2
Instagram was probably pretty new, right?

[00:52:51.350] - Speaker 1
It was 2014. It had been a little while. A couple of years? But I was on my... Yeah. I was on my daughter's what they called tumbler. I don't even know if that was... I wasn't really into the social thing, but I was specifically told by my kids, don't go on Instagram. And I didn't ask why. I just said, don't. It's not for you. So that's interesting. So I went on it. Of course.

[00:53:21.910] - Speaker 2
And then- That was the only invitation you needed.

[00:53:24.360] - Speaker 1
It was like a brand new giant magazine. It went down the rabbit hole And they lost me for a summer. I see why they told me not to go on. I mean, it was like- It's just too addictive. And so it was like, again, having this thing in your room, too. I always liked the idea of, could I make art in my bedroom by myself? It's just so something simple. But I was on the phone one day with this woman, and I was talking to her and I said, she was a model, Jessica something. Anyway, I was going through her feed, and of course, everybody's posting lots of pictures of themselves. So I'm getting to look at not just five pictures that you like of yourself. Some of these people were posting hundreds of pictures of themselves. So I was going through her feed and And I said, Jessica, there's an image of you. It looks like you're somewhere in Switzerland. You're standing in front of a Brigitte Bardot, a Andy Warhol portrait in your skiot. And I said, it's a fabulous I don't care who took it. I don't pay any attention to who takes photographs.

[00:54:51.070] - Speaker 1
I said, this is an amazing photograph. You should make a portrait of this. And she simply said, Why don't you make a portrait? And then it clicked. Of course, I should make a portrait of it.

[00:55:06.400] - Speaker 2
And that's how it started. Amazing.

[00:55:08.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Just like, again, one of those things. The universe allowed it to happen. It just keeps... Now, if I was a musician, I would have still been back trying to figure out how to play F sharp on the guitar. There was never the arrow. But with the art, these things just kept happening. It doesn't happen very often. When it does happen and it makes sense, it checks all the boxes. And when she said that, and of course, my niece, I'm so lame sometimes, told me how to screen save back in those days, I'm not screen What's this? And then the image would appear on your phone in a grid and it was organized. Because I had stopped taking pictures because this analog shit, they got rid of slide. Slides. I only photographed with slides. Slides was my go-to because it didn't take up any room. You didn't have to print a slide. It was both a positive and a negative. It's very convenient. So when they got rid of that, I just dropped. I did the upstate thing. I couldn't move into the digital camera world. This was too weird for me. But when she showed me the screen save, it just opened up a whole new what I call post-place, meaning I can be anywhere and make art at any time under any circumstance.

[00:57:03.430] - Speaker 1
And I'm not on social media much anymore. But when I did her portrait, then it started, okay, what is my contribution in terms of like... And I realized it was the comments underneath.

[00:57:23.320] - Speaker 2
So you would just write a comment?

[00:57:24.700] - Speaker 1
I started basically not stick jujitsu or joycean riffs. But I would do this what I call bird talk.

[00:57:40.510] - Speaker 2
What would be an example?

[00:57:42.560] - Speaker 1
Just crazy sentences that I would make up that made no sense. Most of the time I would sit with the portrait and I'd be watching TV and I'd wait for the ads and the ads would say something that I'd write it down because it would make no sense at all.

[00:57:58.570] - Speaker 2
Unrelated.

[00:57:59.300] - Speaker 1
Totally related to the image. Most of them were in the beginning because the logarithm would change sometimes. I only was allowed to maybe make a sentence or really quick. It's almost like a jazz sentence.

[00:58:16.930] - Speaker 2
Would you make a sentence and then take a screenshot right away? Because otherwise, it would move down the feed, right?

[00:58:23.080] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but I figured out how to get rid of... That was the other thing. I figured out how to get rid of all their comments so mine would move up. How? I don't know how. To this day, I don't know how I- You knew how at that time you could make it happen. I figured it out. And I don't know if you can do that anymore. I'm not sure. What I was afraid of, which I didn't know at the time, were they also losing it on their feed? I see. But they weren't. It was only on my feed. Oh, great. Then what I would do is I would look at their comments, and sometimes I would keep a really interesting comment.

[00:59:01.930] - Speaker 2
Along next to yours.

[00:59:03.220] - Speaker 1
Along next to mine. But mine would always be the bottom one.

[00:59:06.880] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:59:08.050] - Speaker 1
Mine would be the last sentence. And some of them, when I look back at them, I had to be convinced to show these images.

[00:59:18.370] - Speaker 2
After the first one, did you think, Okay, I'm off and running. I'm going to do a bunch of them now?

[00:59:22.710] - Speaker 1
I did a whole bunch. Again, I did my friends. I went on whoever had a feed. I I did my friends. I did people I didn't know. I did people that maybe I would want to know. I did people that... It's hard to know, to explain why I would pick someone like the very first. How did the people show up in that very first show? Why those people? Yeah. Yeah. Some of them were my friends. Some of them I knew. But mostly it was about the way their portraits appeared To me, they would only appear that way because they were on Instagram. So it was a very strange way they would show up, sometimes with friends. And it was all about maybe it was this distance thing. It was a very different-looking type of portrait just to begin with, regardless of what I did with it. And my transfer was simply... I had the option of making it into a graph, but I decided on... It was a very new type of canvas that had just come out, very white and very tightly wound. When I saw that reproduced, and I saw how the ink fused with the canvas.

[01:00:46.030] - Speaker 2
Is it like a laser print?

[01:00:47.590] - Speaker 1
No, it was just an inkjet.

[01:00:49.670] - Speaker 2
Inkjet?

[01:00:50.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Inkjet had started to become almost ubiquitous.

[01:00:55.680] - Speaker 2
How big were the images?

[01:00:57.260] - Speaker 1
The first size I think was like 48 wide and maybe 54 inches tall. Now, of course, I can make them tall.

[01:01:10.410] - Speaker 2
Do you still make them?

[01:01:12.090] - Speaker 1
Not so much anymore, but I did a book recently called New Painting, where I took images of just people painting with their backs to their painting. A lot of women, some men, and just at At some point, five or six years ago, there was just so many people painting, it seemed to me. I just needed to capture that idea. And everybody was painting the same painting, it seemed. So I started doing that. We published a book.

[01:01:50.580] - Speaker 2
Again, 300 copies?

[01:01:52.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah, something like that. Are all the books like that? Sometimes there are a thousand. Sometimes they never go into... I don't think they've ever I'm going to do a second printing. I've never done that. But no, they're for a small edition. I like that. But the Instagram portraits got immediately. There was tension, and there was crying by my kids. They got hammered at school. I mean, it came out. It became a thing. I didn't quite understand it.

[01:02:31.530] - Speaker 2
Did people not like it?

[01:02:34.080] - Speaker 1
Oh, the hate was unbelievable. Oh, my God. And then the money became a factor. And of course, then the people in the-The fact that you were selling them for a lot of money because they were desirable, collectible things. And the people in them who had no idea that they were in them and had heard about how much-They were selling for. I got that. It blew up into a shit storm. It really became an issue. The way I describe my before and after is that before, I owned half a stereo. No one would sue me. I could do anything the fuck I wanted it. Nobody was looking. In some ways, the before was great because-You were anonymous. I was so used to just doing my thing, and I didn't care.

[01:03:28.860] - Speaker 2
If people didn't like it, it was okay.

[01:03:30.680] - Speaker 1
It doesn't matter. I mean, I was just going to do it regardless because there was no... No repercussions. No, nothing. Even when I did my own crazy gallery with the Brook Shields portrait, that was cloak and dagger stuff that was fun Lower East Side. I called it even Lower Manhattan. It was really... Rivington back then was really bad neighborhood. And to go to that gallery, which was sometimes open, sometimes not open. Who was behind this gallery? I had a beard, this woman supposedly running it.

[01:04:07.780] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:04:08.470] - Speaker 1
But in those days, the idea of being I was sued. It would never occur to me. I didn't have any- Why would anybody care? No. But then the money thing, that's the only reason why there's litigation in the first place.

[01:04:30.440] - Speaker 2
Forgetting the litigation for a minute, you put up a show, everybody's talking about it, people hate it. How are you feeling?

[01:04:39.770] - Speaker 1
I got mad and really pissed off and went to the gallery. Three days before the show was supposed to come down, I took the show down myself because I was really pissed that they didn't say extended for another two weeks. And I left the gallery.

[01:05:04.340] - Speaker 2
I left.

[01:05:06.430] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Gagosian that day. Wow. I was so pissed off. Wow. That they didn't see that they That something was happening. Let it happen. Let it. Because first of all, I didn't ask to show these. I never asked. They asked me.

[01:05:22.810] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:05:23.830] - Speaker 1
I didn't ask you. I never asked anything from a gallery.

[01:05:27.660] - Speaker 2
But if it's a hit- But I never had a hit.

[01:05:30.400] - Speaker 1
I never had this much reaction and this much drama. Why do you think they wanted to take it down? I don't think it wasn't Larry. It was the people who work under him. I think I don't want to even... I know why, but I think there was some... It wasn't about a scheduling thing. They could have extended it. But when I heard that there was no... I walked in with a video and I had two assistants, and the gallery assistant came running down, What are you doing? What's going on? And I wouldn't speak. Great. I just took them.

[01:06:16.680] - Speaker 2
What a great story. And you filmed it?

[01:06:19.050] - Speaker 1
We filmed it. Amazing. And they had no idea what was going on. And I just took them off the wall.

[01:06:24.450] - Speaker 2
Were they already sold?

[01:06:26.280] - Speaker 1
They all sold.

[01:06:27.280] - Speaker 2
They all sold, but you took them back.

[01:06:29.450] - Speaker 1
I don't know what we did.

[01:06:31.380] - Speaker 2
I'm sure eventually the people got them.

[01:06:33.310] - Speaker 1
Yeah, people got them, but I took them.

[01:06:36.580] - Speaker 2
But you didn't want them to show it anymore because they weren't being respectful of it.

[01:06:40.690] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm not even sure that they knew what was going on. They knew what was going on. I'm sure if I had talked to Larry, which I wasn't, I wasn't really in communication that much. But I didn't want to ask because I don't want to be beholden. I don't want to owe anybody anything at all, ever.

[01:07:00.150] - Speaker 2
I understand.

[01:07:01.230] - Speaker 1
So I just thought rather than wait for it to be over, I want it to be over on my terms. But what was so strange is that we made up. And three months after that, they did, I think it was the freeze art fair in New York. They did the whole booth, and that created an even bigger shit storm because the price had tripled. And that's what caused-It was Instagram again, back by popular demand. And it really looked actually in an art fair setting, it looked good. They looked good on a wall for some reason. I wasn't convinced. I had to be convinced to show them at all. But the minute we hung them in this particular gallery that was in the back of a bookstore on the ground floor of Madison Avenue, There was something about the reflection, the scale of... You had to walk through a bookstore. There was already text and images. So it was a very seamless trip into the next room, and it made sense. And they wallpapered the room. Great. When you said collector, I do have one collector that I love and revere. Irving Blum. If you go to his apartment in Los Angeles, he has 20 of these things hanging in his house.

[01:08:39.240] - Speaker 1
And for him, I've interviewed him. I've videotaped him. I've talked to him, been a friend of his for quite some time. And to me, he's not just a collector. He's at a different level in terms of... It's It's a different curation. Yeah. He was the one... He pissed a lot of the California artists off. But that soupcan show, he It's almost like there's another side to that coin where if an artist does something as, say, 62, when you walk into an artist's, well, he didn't a studio at a townhouse, and there on leaning against the wall is a painting of a soup can in 1962 or '61, this high. And there are several of them. They are all different flavors. You have to like, what? You got me uptown. First of all- It's insulting. It's almost like, what are you? Why Why are you wasting? So the other side of that is someone reception. It's not a compliment. It's almost a way of completion. Because It wasn't... Yeah, there's the soup cans, and they're leaning against the wall, but it wasn't completed until Irving came along and decided, I want to show these. He had to have as big a perspective as Warhol had Because he brought them to California.

[01:10:34.320] - Speaker 1
Not only did he show them, he showed them on a shelf.

[01:10:39.170] - Speaker 2
It's a great idea. I didn't know that.

[01:10:40.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And he sold the story that Irving tells is Dennis Hopper bought two. I thought he only bought one, but Irving said he bought two, and that was it. And then Irving realized He realized at the end of the show that they should all be together. He called up Dennis, who, luckily, I got to meet just before he passed away. Yeah. Call him up. Dennis read. And then Irving called Andy up and said, I want to buy them all. Would you take $60 a month for the next couple of... And Andy said, It was like that money, that terms. And that started his relationship with Warhol. And then the next show he did out was the Silver Elvis's. Amazing. Which Warhol just sent out on a huge roll. And Irving says, What am I supposed to... He says, Oh, it just caught them up. That's why there's a single, some doubles, and threes because Irving caught them.

[01:12:03.180] - Speaker 2
Un Unbelievable.

[01:12:05.100] - Speaker 1
I mean, stories like that make me feel so good about what I do and what I could possibly do. And to get back to that time-life building, what else I discovered long after I left was, which is unbelievable, is that Warhol's Empire, the film, was shot from an office building in the Time Life building, and that was an overnight thing. Someone had to get... He had to have some weird permission to get into that building. I wish I had known that at the time. I would have loved to gone to that office building, that office, and look out. Where did they shoot that? Because for me, I've always said, I want to make a movie. People say, Why don't you make? I said, Well, I'm not going to make a movie until I can make something as interesting as Empire. So again, full circle now, I have made a movie. It's 6 hours and 47 minutes. It's called Deposition. What's it of? It's mydeposition from my- From the Instagram case?

[01:13:24.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:13:25.450] - Speaker 1
Tell me about...

[01:13:26.360] - Speaker 2
I don't know anything about the lawsuit.

[01:13:27.900] - Speaker 1
Okay, so I got sued But I knew- By one of the- Two.

[01:13:31.540] - Speaker 2
Two of the people in the show. Two.

[01:13:35.070] - Speaker 1
I had already been sued. I had taken some pictures of Rastafarians and made them into paintings years ago. Bought a book of Rasta's in Saint Bart and lived with the book for three or four years and drew in it and cut it out and didn't pay any attention to the author. I didn't know who the author was. I just liked the images. But he sued me, which in In hindsight, yeah, he should have. I mean, I should have asked. I could have easily avoided. But I didn't think that way. I didn't think about asking permission. I never have. I didn't think that's part of making art. The problem with asking permission is they could say no, and then you don't get to make Art. And that's no fun. I would have done that anyway, though, even if they said no. It's like the building inspector. But anyway, knowing what I knew from the first lawsuit, I knew from the second that when you give a deposition, you get videoed. And so I knew... I'm not even sure if I can even... It's still cool to say stuff like this. I don't know. Because we settled, finally.

[01:15:07.060] - Speaker 1
I had had it this past. It had taken a toll on me. Eight years.

[01:15:15.110] - Speaker 2
Takes a toll. Yeah.

[01:15:16.790] - Speaker 1
It's no fun. Just mentally, it's horrible. But on the back of my mind, I said, I'm going to have this video. Because when I went in, I knew I was going to be videoed. And I knew it was a bit of a performance. I guess I can say that. I think you can. You're supposed to tell... I did tell the truth. Of course. And you could tell the truth and do a performance. I knew that you're supposed to look straight at the videographer. You're not supposed to look left or right. That's what the lawyers say. And when the lawyer asks you a question, you answer. But But at times, I would answer their question and take up to 15 minutes. And there came a point in the deposition where the lawyer stood up, screamed, Would you tell your client to stop this talking? And then, of course, I shut down and just look straight in my deposition. And you hear them arguing. Yeah. I like the idea you can walk in at any time if it's shown. And it's just me talking about art. That's it. And I think as a movie, we're planning on showing it soon in Rome, of all places, in this little chapel that a friend of mine.

[01:17:03.580] - Speaker 1
Do you know when? I think Easter. We were going to call it Deposition Row because there's a mention They were trolling me before I did something about Dylan and Desolation Row. And I said, Deposition Row. I said, in a couple of days, I'm going to be indeposition row. And they wanted to know what I meant by that. But I think it's cleaner just to call it deposition. Both are good. We'll see. I don't know. There was talk we were going to screen it at the Metro Graph about a year ago. I decided, I don't know.

[01:17:52.790] - Speaker 2
I like the idea of doing it first way away.

[01:17:58.520] - Speaker 1
Yes. On a little box. Yeah. Great. I think we've cleared all the legal hurdles because depositions are public. My first step is people publish them. But I never saw that coming. That's the other thing about where does this go? So, yeah, I get to have a movie. That's great. Finally, people can stop asking me when I'm going to make a movie. Because the idea of making a movie, to me, is so collaborative, and I don't think I could do that. How is it different when there's someone there? What do you think? Well, it's a lot. When someone is with me. The last time I had real assistance, I had a studio in Harlem. I had it for about seven years, just before COVID hit. And the great thing about having It depends, obviously, what you're making, too. But I was making paintings. And the great thing is you could make a mess and you don't I have to clean it up.

[01:19:20.210] - Speaker 2
That's the advantage. And it sounds stupid, but it's really like you don't have to clean your own brushes and you don't have to...

[01:19:32.720] - Speaker 1
It's all prep work. But My idea about making art has always been I never wanted it to be a job. Once it becomes labor, I get so detached and bored, and I want to move on to the next body of work or another process because I have no desire to work for a living, basically. You never Yeah. Do you think you can get to the point where just having the idea is enough and you don't even have to make it?

[01:20:13.640] - Speaker 2
That, too.

[01:20:14.830] - Speaker 1
You can file it away in your head and live with it in your head.

[01:20:22.320] - Speaker 2
That's an interesting point, especially with our experiences and our lifetimes, I think because of the histories of what we've done, I think we can actually do that now because I know that I've become more patient.

[01:20:40.400] - Speaker 1
I don't have to rush. I don't have to make a painting. You're right. Sometimes-i'm just wondering where the line is. Why do you have to necessarily-Actually, why to bring it into the world? It's still-It's still here. It's still there. Yeah. Interesting. I guess the benefit of bringing it into the world is that then you can share it with someone else.

[01:21:11.530] - Speaker 2
I don't think there's any way to do it otherwise.

[01:21:16.650] - Speaker 1
Yeah, or you can just share it with your one friend or even share it with yourself. I make a lot of things that I need to make just to see what they look like. Then most of the time, for a long time now, I'm at least able to make things and put them away for years. Like the work that I'm showing in MAPFA.

[01:21:49.520] - Speaker 2
I mean, It's been in the racks for maybe almost 15 years. And I said, let's bring... I call my winter studio Upstate.

[01:22:00.520] - Speaker 1
I very rarely go up there anymore. You used to live there pretty full-time, no? I lived there full-time. I left New York for a little while. How many years? I left in '95, and I met my wife up there, and we had kids. And I I found it exotic. I found it strange. I had never been out of the city.

[01:22:32.040] - Speaker 2
I found it bizarre.

[01:22:33.930] - Speaker 1
Where did you grow up? Well, I grew up outside of Boston, in a suburb. It was funny, too, because Panama is now in the news, and that's where I was born. I was born in the Canal zone. How did it come up for you to be born in Panama? My father worked for the government. So did my mother. What did they do? Do you know what they did? To tell you the truth, I knew I knew what my mother did. She worked for the OSS, which was pre-CIA. That she told me. But my father, I was never very close to them, but I was never very close to him. But he was a nice guy, but he was just... I never really knew what he did. But that's how I came to be. He was stationed there.

[01:23:44.210] - Speaker 2
So we moved around a lot.

[01:23:47.100] - Speaker 1
You have brothers and sisters?

[01:23:49.790] - Speaker 2
I have a sister. Old Older or younger?

[01:23:53.390] - Speaker 1
A little older, a couple of years. How was your relationship with her? I haven't talked to her in a long, long time, but she's very important to me because she introduced me to cultural things at the time. She was a couple of years older than me, and And would introduce me to things that, say, I was in the eighth grade, she was a sophomore in high school or something, and all of a sudden, I get turned on to. But anyway, the upstate thing I think it was on and off for about seven years, and then we moved back. I have a body shop where we make... When I wanted to paint, I wanted to paint something that was already painted. I wanted to move on from the refotographing. And I always liked the way, certain way that cars were painted by teenagers, where they would metal flake, stripe, They would put a flame, mostly Bondo. They would put nine coats, but they would leave the hood completely Bondo. And I would see that on the street, and I said, that looks great. Why is Bondo so Good looking. What is it? It's just great. Why?

[01:25:32.820] - Speaker 1
I don't know. It is. It is. And everyone knows it.

[01:25:37.540] - Speaker 2
It's like, why aren't all cars Bondo? Well, I set up a shop.

[01:25:44.160] - Speaker 1
After I moved on from Time Life, I moved to California for a little while, and I discovered lifestyle magazines. Like Sunset magazine? Well, like surf, bike, or heavy metal. It seems like in these giant magazine stands. I was just mad for magazines after a time.

[01:26:07.340] - Speaker 2
Me, too. Why? I love just aging. I love magazines, too. But I noticed in the car magazines in the back, there were advertisements for car parts, where you could send away for a particular part.

[01:26:25.500] - Speaker 1
And I was very interested And the biggest part was the hood at the time. There was this company in California. And for not so much money, the idea that you could send away for it and it would arrive in the mail, saving up your car hood. It's so funny. You could order a specific one. Well, of course, because everyone else was buying it to fit the car they had. But I was buying it because it had a certain subtext. Like a 1968 Dodge Challenger was in Bullet. That's what the bad guys drove. Or a 1970 Dodge Challenger was in Vanishing Point. That's what Barry Newman drove. So even if nobody got the painting, the people who picked up the work, the shippers, they would go crazy. They didn't know anything about art, but they knew about what a challenger was. And I just love that. I just love the connection I made with that side of the art. It had nothing to do with painting at that point. It just had to do with, yeah, they knew.

[01:27:55.180] - Speaker 2
The thing you chose to paint, it was almost like a secret language going on beneath the surface.

[01:28:04.390] - Speaker 1
It's the Mason's handshake. Insiders. Inside World, which is a publication I published once. It's called Inside.

[01:28:12.850] - Speaker 2
It's just basically, yeah. It's a way of talking culturally about what you share and what you know.

[01:28:21.590] - Speaker 1
You might not even know necessarily why something is cool, but you know it's cool, and you know the other people who know it's cool know it's And then they add on even something you didn't even know about that's cool. It's a whole additional conversation going on. That's great. I think it was two years ago, we had a show of the hoods.

[01:28:52.710] - Speaker 2
They never went over very well. People still didn't quite get them.

[01:28:59.120] - Speaker 1
But I started painting them at first with very specific car colors that came out of the factories. Again, just more non-fiction to them as much as I could. And then when I moved upstate, I built a proper body shop, hired some real motor heads, and we went to town. So I'm just saying this idea of luck or juxtaposition, or when you walk into the studio and something happens. We basically had a junkyard at some point, hundreds of cars. And one day I walked in and there were these four doors that were leaning up against the wall, and I looked at them. I said, oh, that's the doors. I said, don't throw those away. Let's weld them together in a row. And the Chevy Impala is going to be Jim. That's Jim Morris. The other three, I'm not sure what car they came out of. But that day, walking in the studio, that experience for me is what it's all about. Okay, I got it that day. Yeah. Right.

[01:30:24.880] - Speaker 2
And it was so like- But it's happening every day.

[01:30:29.590] - Speaker 1
It's always happening. It's so dumb. It's so It was so, not moronic, but for a couple of years I've been walking around this stuff, and I never made the connection. When do you make the connection? When did you make the Jim Marson connection? I don't understand that one myself. Well, I just...

[01:30:56.600] - Speaker 2
It was just the four... I looked down the four doors.

[01:31:01.870] - Speaker 1
Oh, the four doors? And I called them the doors.

[01:31:06.550] - Speaker 2
And I said, that's the piece.

[01:31:09.490] - Speaker 1
I see. It's the doors. We welded them together.

[01:31:14.110] - Speaker 2
We did one going right, and we did one going left. And I started to become... Then I got obsessed with doors. But anyway, those are the kinds of things that wouldn't happen with me with the guitar. Obviously, it happens with people who play the guitar. Yeah. A discovery happens, a realization. Yeah. I mean, I know that I played in a band, the Glenn Bronca Band. Everybody played with Glenn Bronca.

[01:31:50.980] - Speaker 1
Every artist I know. He would come over to your apartment and said, This is what you hit one note, and as long as you can do this. He had seven guitarists on the stage. I remember one night we opened Irving Plaza. Great. Laurie Anderson was on the bill. This was about maybe the fourth or fifth time I played in public with Glenn. Glenn was very serious. He really took his... It was his way or the highway. And I had brought along a friend who was a real rock and roller to fill out the guitar. And that evening, something happened on stage where I looked at my rock and roller friend, and he looked at me, and something was happening with the sound. And we both recognized we came came off stage and said, should we tell Glenn what we just thought we heard? And I said, he doesn't want to hear that. He wants to be full of glass. He wants to be taken seriously. He doesn't want any references to rock and roll or anything like that. But what was interesting, I just heard a new rock and roll, I thought. But I didn't want to say anything to him.

[01:33:31.980] - Speaker 1
Do you remember the name of the piece? Because I want to see if we can find it. I don't remember the name. All I remember is that I quit that night because I couldn't talk to the guy. Because the next day who joins the band is Thurston Moore and Leonardo. I've asked Lee, Hey, I know they probably didn't stay for so long, but they probably did hear something. Then, of course, they turned it into Sonic Youth. I think that's what happened. So Sonic Youth was an outgrowth of Glenn I think that's probably my... Because I was hanging around with Kim. Take a look. See if any of these songs look like the song just because I'd love to listen to a... I haven't listened to Glenn in... His records were put out by the 99 Records. That was the way that I learned about. Maybe the Ascension. Let's listen. I think Lee and Thurston came along. It just... Grew out of that. Is there a way of Richard Prince's Loud song? It's the only song I've put out in my life That's sweet. This is the only song that I've ever done that I have liked.

[01:35:11.310] - Speaker 1
Tell me the story of that. How I bet it couldn't exist. I had a very strange interlude where I was... Do you know that guy named Jeff Aeroff? Yeah. Okay. No, well. Kidding. He's a really good friend of mine. He's great. I love Jeff. He gave me access to Warner Brothers' publicity pictures. When you knew I love publicity pictures, I could just go through them and take what I wanted. But he also knew that I was a want to be a songwriter, and my goal was to try to write a hit song. That was just stupid. He brought me out to California, and he put me together with some of the Session guys from the Beach Boys. He was It was a complete nutty thing to do. Sometimes I would hear these melodies in my head, but I could just... Again, it hit a wall. But anyway, I would go back to my bedroom. What I wanted to do is just record my own stuff in my bedroom on my own. So I set up, I had two cassettes, and I had a keyboard, and I would just play the keyboard and record it on one cassette, and then I would play what I had recorded on the cassette and play more keyboard, but recorded on the second cassette.

[01:37:02.420] - Speaker 1
Great. And then I would just go back and forth. I came up with this thing, and when I heard it, I just said, That's it. This was 1985. I'm not going to do anything more. I don't want to do I think more music. I told Jeff that. I'm not going to... Nothing's going to ever happen. But I kept that. I always thought... I just thought it was loud. Yeah. It also sounds spiritual. It sounds like maybe church music. It just happened. Yeah. Were you playing it loud in the room when you were playing it? Not really. Because it sounds loud. It sounds loud. Yeah, it does sound loud. Maybe it has to do with the cassette recorder's compression or something. Something. It makes it sound loud. I have no idea, but it had always existed on a cassette.

[01:38:13.630] - Speaker 2
Over the years, of course, I've met thousands of really well-known musicians.

[01:38:19.050] - Speaker 1
I love speaking to musicians, and I've had the opportunity to actually sit down. They want to talk about art. They don't want to talk about music. Everybody's He's an artist. But that's fine. I'll look at whether it's Ronny Wood or Johnny Depp or Paul McCartney or Dylan. I think Dylan, to me, is the more accomplished artist, I think. I got a call one day from his manager. This was years ago. Would you want to meet Bob He wants to meet you. I said, What are you nuts? Is this some lunch? Frank? He says, Yeah, he's not. He wants to meet you. I said, God, yeah, fine. So this short story was that he was playing at the Beacon, as he does, usually in the air. He says, He's out in New Jersey. You go to this stay at this motel out in Jersey. I said, All right, that's where I go. So he says, Yeah, that's where you go. And so I go out there and I pull into this ratty old motel and I go into the lobby and there's one of his handlers there. And I figured I'm going to go up to a room.

[01:39:58.800] - Speaker 1
He says, No, he's out in the parking lot. I said, Oh, all right. We walk out in the parking lot and he's in an RV. That's where he's staying.

[01:40:13.870] - Speaker 2
It's not a very nice-looking... It's just a regular beaten up, which he drives. He loves to drive this.

[01:40:23.180] - Speaker 1
Interesting. That in itself would knock me for a look.

[01:40:28.010] - Speaker 2
Of course, I'm nervous as hell.

[01:40:30.910] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan. Of course. He wants to talk about these publicity pictures of all the work. I guess he had seen me. I had started working with publicity pictures in the mid '80s, but then really got into them in the late '90s and started collecting more and just organizing memorabilia. I love the way I would go into a memorabilia store, and something would be elaborately framed, and it would be a signature. And I just love the formalism of the presentation. You would get this photograph that they would double mat, but then they were selling the autograph. And so I wanted to mimic that. And I just had a... It was just, again, another journey, another body of work. I don't know where it would lead. I don't know. Got you to Bob Dylan. But had got me a call from Dylan. And, of course, we sat there for hours. And he was scoping out the idea of what... He did want to talk about the art world and And how does it operate. He had shows of his paintings, and I wasn't aware of his paintings at the time, but I soon... Then I visited him again in California.

[01:42:12.640] - Speaker 1
And what I was very impressed was the gates that he makes. He's phenomenal. I just think the subject for Dylan, the idea, and he brought me to this, I think was in Santa Monica, his studio, and all this ironwork that he collects and he and he makes these gates. And I just thought, first of all, I looked at it and I said, that is great folk art. The marriage that he made with the subject. The paintings, okay. I wrote about the paintings. I wrote about the fact that it almost seemed like his studio. The term I came up with, Witness It was just protection. It had that vibe like he could just... He needed to escape out the back door five seconds flat. He could. It wasn't an artist's studio. It was a strange-looking studio. But the gate was really phenomenal. Then he did have a couple of shows. He had a couple of shows with Gagosian, and I helped out. I helped. I didn't really help, but I I became friends with his manager who I used to visit his offices and talk to him about the memorabilia that he was organizing. And the painting, I just was knocked out.

[01:43:54.380] - Speaker 1
The original painting from music from Big Pink and self-portrait painting was there. Wow. You could photograph those. I have done many- You could re-photograph those. I've done many variations of those two paintings. But I think, yeah, that's probably the idea of becoming friends or at least not friends, but acquaintances with a musician like that. I know that I've seen your thing with Paul McCartney. Paul and I get together. We get together at least once a year for the last, I don't know, year, whatever. And And it gets easier. I get very nervous. It's like I have this thing where it's like, but this past August, because he likes to come to the studio. He likes to see what's going on because he likes to paint. He was very good friends with D'Cuny, who was one of my favorite artists. And we could really communicate on that level, just visually. I know that he just had his photograph shown that he took in '64. He showed him at Brooklyn. But this past visit was really interesting because he played me Sunday this new music that he was just rolling around with. Then, of course, then he split and went on this big tour, and I guess it's over now.

[01:45:40.640] - Speaker 1
But to have conversations, I think, with artists who who have their feet in maybe a couple of different worlds in the arts, whether it's maybe they're making movies, but they're playing music, too, whether they're painting. I like that because one is usually experimental. For the most part, one is really solid. It's what they do for a living. But it's nice to share the studio experience with a musician. Different than sharing it with an artist? I think so, yeah. They're looking at it in ways in which another artist... When I get together with someone like Christopher or something. I just went to his... He had a show downtown on Wall Street recently, took over a floor, an abandoned office floor and put his work up. And it was really successful. Whether it was the windows looking out, the textures, the leftover, the wires hanging from the seeing him. It all figured into the work. He created an environment, or he took over an existing environment. And I've done this before, and he's known about that. It was the first house. The first house I did out in LA was a teardown. We were able to lease it for three months.

[01:47:21.030] - Speaker 1
That was an incredibly fun... And I met a lot of artists who... Because I stayed for three months in LA to do the project. It wasn't in a gallery. I treated the house like a domestic environment. How did you get the idea to do that? I just like the idea of showing work in a domestic with furniture with the idea of hanging a work in a kid's bedroom. The idea of having outdoor space like a garage or a driveway or park a car and then tearing the house part. And then sheetrock. I love sheetrock like Bondo. For some reason, I love the idea of sheetrocking, taping, but don't paint it. Leave the tape Leave all that exposed. Let me show you a project after this because based on that, you're going to love it. Basically, I've done three houses. So I did second house, which was up near my property, but that was actually bought by the Guggenheim, the whole place. Amazing. There were all hoods in that house. And then it got hit by lightning. It burned off. What are the odds? What are the odds? But it was like a gift. But the house was existing.

[01:49:00.940] - Speaker 1
House was existing in a field of grass. It was abandoned. And I'd been driving by it for years. It was just a simple ranch house, but it was floated in a sea of grass. And I said, I'd love to do something with that house one day. One day, it was for sale. Perfect. The son, I guess the dad had passed away, bought the house, and I just started doing my thing. Did you put any works in it or you worked with what was there? I worked with the rooms, and I worked what was going on the outside. I didn't really choose I didn't change the shape. I didn't change the way you got up to the house, the driveway.

[01:50:02.830] - Speaker 2
I didn't mow the lawn.

[01:50:05.270] - Speaker 1
I parked a car and put it on cinder blocks because everybody has gold cars. I basically did what I was introduced to when I first went upstate.

[01:50:19.320] - Speaker 2
Because when I went upstate, as I said, I didn't really know what it was like to live in the country.

[01:50:29.470] - Speaker 1
What I soon realized, there's a basketball hoop in almost everybody's yard. There are these tire planters. I mean, there was all these kinds of things that I just started treating people's yards as a page in a magazine. I started photographing people's yards and what was in the yards. And And I got my own yard, that house. And I treated the house as an upstate.

[01:51:02.700] - Speaker 2
And I decided I put a lot of different things in before I decided, let's just do hood.

[01:51:11.510] - Speaker 1
And then I don't know what happened. I'm not sure why it was sold to the Guggenheim. I'm not even sure why they bought it, but they did. I think they were trying to go through all the legal things to get it access. So they had to- I see. They had to deal with parking, handicap. Well, they never got to that stage because they removed all the hoods except one, which was mine. And then my painting, which I did not sell them as part of that, was what I call my Sid Vicious painting, which was this thing I had bought at a sex pistol, almost like a small, some cheap fabric that I bought at a flea market, and I stretched it and I painted everybody out except Sid. I just thought, I like Sid. I don't know. I love his version of my way. I mean, that to me was just phenomenal. And I did eventually meet McLaren, who was a real character. But that burned. I got a call. I mean, what? But luckily, the only thing in that was the sit in my hood, which was no big deal because I could just repair it.

[01:52:51.380] - Speaker 1
And then I left it there. And I think we renegotiated where I bought the house back from the... And some weird deal for a dollar or something. And it's the house since now- Still there. Well, there's very little there. The car is still there. The '78, a beautiful view. I'm not sure what to do with the property. But maybe the ruin is the most interesting thing it could be. It's like going to Rome. It might be. And it's all been fairly documented. I published a book called Second House. And that's the thing about books is they have a way of hanging around. Publish 300 copies. I have my own publishing company, and we publish 300 copies, and we give them away. We just give them a couple of book, really There's a lot of really interesting bookstores who like the books.

[01:54:03.660] - Speaker 2
When did you start doing that, the publishing?

[01:54:07.570] - Speaker 1
A while ago. It's this company called Fulton Ryder. I just decided... I've never been interested in this idea of the catalog resonate. I just don't see how that's going to be possible with me. I know people have tried it, and people are trying to do it right now.

[01:54:32.210] - Speaker 2
You make too much stuff?

[01:54:34.700] - Speaker 1
Well, I just don't see how you're going to organize it. Yeah. I mean, unless you want like 25... I mean, I make bodies of work, and I always have. Do you think of yourself as a curator? Upstate, I've curated a bunch of buildings.

[01:54:57.150] - Speaker 2
I've built buildings over the past 30 years.

[01:55:00.720] - Speaker 1
It's almost like a little village now. It's almost a mini Marfa. What I'm planning to do is I want to do a show called Collection, where I've taken other artists' work, and I've paid homage to them. So in that sense, there's a bit of curating going on. I don't have a space for that show yet, and I don't know when I want to do that show. And what I've done with the ommages is For the Warhol, to me, it was an interesting Warhol because it belonged to Alice Cooper. It was one of the electric chairs, which, of course, is interesting because... And we did a trade. And so all I did was I did a zine on the whole thing. Him owning it, Schepp is in there, as his manager. And then every electric chair that's supposedly out there. Because there was some question about this one, but I don't care. It's Alice Cooper. And I believe he got it from Warhol. So that is part of the curating, if you were going to say yes, because that's my idea of paying homage. And then I have a Pollock where it's a photograph of him by very well-known photographer.

[01:56:42.550] - Speaker 1
But I bought a canceled check from Pollock made out to the IRS, but it has his signature. So that's Pollock. Then D'Cunin, I bought... One day, I was talking to this. Do you know the Minutian Gallery? Yeah. He's a strange guy anyway. He was courting me for a while Ellen, but I love his space on the upper East Side. I lived four doors down from his gallery. It's a beautiful space. Does fantastic shows, very focused on what I like to focus on, the type of art. So I was up there. He was talking. He wanted to do a show with me, but I just wasn't sure I could work with him. But I'm sitting in his office, and he has one of the ugliest de Kooning drawings I've ever seen in my life. Great body, but the face looked like someone drew it after. And I said, what's the It's tall. It's big. What's the story with this drawing? I said, Well, I don't know. I said, how much? I knew exactly. I wanted to buy it, and then I wanted to do... I wanted to reproduce the paper, the image, and then I wanted to put my own face in like 15 of them and line them up.

[01:58:27.370] - Speaker 1
So that's the Ducunin. But when you buy Yeah, you could do whatever you want. You buy the real one and my. You buy the Warhol. You have the war and my zine.

[01:58:44.630] - Speaker 2
And then I got a Picasso from 1948, and I rift on that.

[01:58:50.910] - Speaker 1
And you buy all 10. But you also get... At least you get the Picasso. Yeah, that's great. So the idea is like, I'm going to curate. I would say I'm more of a collector. Tell me everything you collect. I collect books. I started collecting paperbacks in the East Village.

[01:59:16.080] - Speaker 2
Based on the covers or?

[01:59:18.030] - Speaker 1
Mostly the beats. I I started with Carouac and that stuff. And I just learned more.

[01:59:26.680] - Speaker 2
I became friends with people who sold first editions.

[01:59:31.120] - Speaker 1
I just haunted and hung out. And then I met other book collectors, and I learned, and I went to the Antiquarian Book Fairs and years and years of just studying and knowing what was going on. Because I didn't start to read until very late. I was very dyslexic. I I didn't read until I was 22. But when I started, it flipped. I just started being able to read. And I just started reading everything. But art, sometimes I go through periods where I go crazy and I buy a lot of art. The problem now is we're trying to set up a foundation. In terms of collecting my own, my friends, now I'll call them up and say, Hey, where would you like your art to go? Let's say it's the Institute of Chicago or MoCA. It's not as easy as you think to You can't donate. It's a whole process. It's a bit of a... It's a little defeating. You call them up and you say, Hey, I've got...

[02:00:56.520] - Speaker 2
It's also not what you want to spend your time doing.

[02:01:02.190] - Speaker 1
No, not at all. But I think it's certainly better than selling. But it wasn't making art that really turned me on the most. When I was like 19 or something, I just come back from this European Humanities thing, which I never attended. It was just part of this thing that I went around to all the museums and I would draw. How did you get to go on that? I was at some stupid school that I was avoiding the draft. It was like an alternative hippie school up in Maine. It doesn't even exist. It was like an every loser in person couldn't take an SAT got sent there But they had a humanities course, which was you would go to France, and I, Sure, I'll go. But I never went to class. I just hung out. I would just get on a train. I went to museums all by myself. And But I came back from that trip. There was a little carriage house with a little art department at that school. And there was this guy there. He was my only art teacher. But what really turned me on was going to his house when I was 19.

[02:02:42.300] - Speaker 1
He had real art on the wall. And that, I think, that experience actually was incredibly profound for me because I had never been to a house that had real... He had etchings, he had aquitents, he had dry point, he had painting, had drawings, anywhere like a dry point, Matisse to a Mary Cassatt aquitent to this guy named William Bailey, who was a fantastic draftsman and painter taught for years at Yale. This guy, Walt Cune, who is well known for painting circus. He also put together The Armory. He was one of the three curators that put together The Armory show in where to shop. And he was the guy who always told me, Don't settle on any one thing right now. Don't try to create a style like all the artists that are around our neighborhood in Maine who are trying to get shows and sell their work. Because in those days, you were in Wyeth country. I'm a huge Wyeth. I love Andrew Wyeth. I'm a huge fan. But there's a lot of other things out there. Was it your path? And then go to New York. At least check it out. And find out what's- Good advice.

[02:04:22.860] - Speaker 1
Going on. And that was difficult. Again, I didn't want to leave that bubble. And I was having a great time up in Maine hanging out with older working artists. Going to a figure drawing class. I love that. But the start is really not that different from a lot of other... I think it was getting to New York that the idea of walking down the street in the middle of the afternoon on West Broadway, back then in '74, and being able to pop in to a gallery. You know, One, it's free.

[02:05:09.750] - Speaker 2
They've got us anything.

[02:05:11.540] - Speaker 1
Not having to make an appointment, not having to make a plan. Maybe you just went to the bodega to get a sandwich. Oh, I'll just walk in and I see this Art Provera show that I don't really know much about. Or I see a Vido Aconci, who I later become very good friends with. I can't believe I'm friends with this guy years later. But in 1974, I look forward to see, go to Sonabed or Castelli. It's just not making art. It's the whole... It's like a community. And then bumping in to another for artists and saying, Oh, let's grab a coffee and just talk.

[02:06:05.860] - Speaker 2
I think that's for me, I know it's not for a lot of artists, but for me, that's part of the work. I love coming out to LA, and I used to have shows right away in LA, hotels and crazy, weird places in LA.

[02:06:27.960] - Speaker 1
But the problem with LA is that you just couldn't walk. There's no walking down the street and bumping. You don't You're an Indian. No. You want to go see John Bouldasari, you're going to go all the way to Venice and make an appointment, talk to the guy or whatever. There was no spontaneity that way. And I'm not sure what artists, if that's part of their routine these days. I know a lot of musicians like that. That's the camaraderie of fellow travelers. Because if you don't do it, it's a different conversation. Absolutely. Unless you're doing it, it's like speaking another language. I think you also break through to places where you wouldn't ordinarily... Absolutely.

[02:07:26.150] - Speaker 2
Maybe you'd get there much later. I was in Laurel Canyon in 1967. I missed it, though. I was there, and I didn't have the wherewithal to stay.

[02:07:40.220] - Speaker 1
I don't know what would have happened. I was there outside the whiskey when the doors were playing. I had just gotten out of high school. I was visiting my sister.

[02:07:55.910] - Speaker 2
But that community of musicians up in the hills, I love those docks.

[02:08:02.110] - Speaker 1
It's a great time in music. Then them talking about hanging out. I mean, the stories. That time must have been a little bit what I think that I experienced in the early days of Soho. I got there just in time. I mean, it was almost over as soon as I got there, the real estate thing. I mean, it just went. But that's also the luck you happened to go. You had a guy I who told you to go. You listened, you went, you thought you'd go for three months, and you found it.

[02:08:50.190] - Speaker 2
You persisted through years of rejection. Years and years. Yes, but I learned to... I really thought after a while, if the work wasn't rejected, then I'm...

[02:09:02.980] - Speaker 1
I don't know. It's not like I wanted to be rejected. No. But being hated is better than nobody caring. There's an emotion. It's better to have that extreme, either extreme love or this guy is just wrong. Yeah. I don't know. I still have a very narrow definition or idea of what an artist is, especially these days. And it's probably not the correct one.

[02:09:35.960] - Speaker 2
But I still think an artist is essentially an antisocial creature who basically just is in a room doing something by themselves.

[02:09:46.810] - Speaker 1
Their audience doesn't really have one at the moment of the making and probably won't for a while. It's not about them. No. I read a review of one of your shows. The reviewer finished looking at the show and said, I wish I was dead. You know what? I love... It's unbelievable. Sometimes I used to collect those things. It's fantastic. I'm not sure if I've heard that one. Yeah, I wish I was dead. Please kill me. It's unbelievable. Yeah. Well, I don't know what's next, but it's... She's excited about making art now as you've ever been? Yeah. It's all I do. It's all I think about. I don't really do anything else, and I never have. For instance, this is the first time I've actually sat and talked to anybody about what we're talking about in a long, long time. I gave up giving interviews and talking to the press and whatever for a while ago. I don't know. I just felt this time I felt... I mean, I thought I'd feel comfortable because you're an artist. And I think I feel more comfortable around people who are creative because they get it. Even explaining stuff, you get it.

[02:11:27.180] - Speaker 1
You know what it's like. You know you have to make these decisions. And some of the decisions are made not by you, but for you. They're made automatically. It's not like magic.

[02:11:43.460] - Speaker 2
I don't know what the word is. Would you say it's like it's revealed to you? Revealed? Yes, something is definitely...

[02:11:53.570] - Speaker 1
But I think it's recognition. You're able to receive it Whereas most of the population, all that got taken away from them by probably around age six. Somehow the artist, something didn't get removed somehow. Something happened very young. Tetragrammatin is a podcast. Tetragrammatin is a website. Tetragrammatin is a whole world of knowledge.
