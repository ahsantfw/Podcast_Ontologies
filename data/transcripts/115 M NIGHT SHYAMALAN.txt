[00:00:06.680] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. The system rejecting you is such a blessing, and we never experience it that We experience it as pain and confirmation that we're not worthy and we don't have merit and all the imposter syndrome things that we all walk around.

[00:00:40.510] - Speaker 1
But how wonderful it has been for me in the rejection of it all throughout the process. And what's left is so beautiful. I think I said, I was telling someone, I forget where I was speaking, and I said something like that. It came out of... Oh, it was before a premiere or something. I was just speaking the crowd, and I was like, the moment that everything gets burned off and all of it, the rejection and everything, and there's no way to succeed in the system as you see it, the next thought you have is so beautiful.

[00:01:17.730] - Speaker 2
What's the experience for you watching one of your films with an audience? How is it different than watching it yourself?

[00:01:26.850] - Speaker 1
Well, when I'm making it, I am very much like that little kid that's going, Oh, they're going to love that, and that's going to titulate them, and then they're going to laugh at that, and then they're going to gasp at that, and, Oh, they're going to think this, and then I'll go this, do this. And then when I'm watching it, to be honest, it's more of a torture just experience because I'm so hyper raw, like a nerve that anyone rustling, anyone reaching for a drink in the third row is drinking, let alone going to the bathroom, getting up and going to the bathroom, which would just basically cut me, gut me. And whispering and all the things that are humanity, the messiness of it all feels very painful, very, very painful. Again, I guess in each one of those, I'm just so raw. When I'm directing and when I'm watching a movie, I'm very open. People always laugh at me when I'm watching something being shot because my body is reacting. I'm making faces I'm reacting. I'm not distant from it. I'm not an observer. I'm totally connected in an umbilical cord. And the same thing happens in the movie.

[00:02:37.830] - Speaker 1
But when I'm watching my movie with an audience, it's just too sensitive.

[00:02:43.250] - Speaker 2
Are you ever surprised by reactions?

[00:02:45.520] - Speaker 1
Always. Yeah, always. They have an intuitive understanding of the bone structure of a story. It just happens. They know it immediately. They understand it or what it it's doing. And when they reject something, it's related to this bone structure thing. And I tend to think of it as a pyramid of elements. And the first element is the bone structure of a story. And we might get excited about level four of the pyramid and going, Oh, whoa, we're going to do this thing all at the beach, and it's going to do this, and I can do this cinema. You're talking about level four. You didn't do level one of the pyramid yet, which is the structure. Then if you make that error, it's a humility thing, first of all, to start at the bone structure, the skeleton of it.

[00:03:39.560] - Speaker 2
Describe the bone structure.

[00:03:40.860] - Speaker 1
So the bone structure, you know, guy meets girl, it falls in love, She's with somebody else. The bone structure, guy gets to... And then ultimately- Would the bone structure happen in one page? The bone structure is when someone says, Oh, well, that scene was slow, right? When they say something like that, that means they don't know where they are in the story. That's what slow means. I don't know where I am in the story.

[00:04:05.790] - Speaker 2
It doesn't have to do with the scene itself.

[00:04:07.630] - Speaker 1
No.

[00:04:08.430] - Speaker 2
It has to do with where we are in the story and whether we're advancing the story in that moment.

[00:04:13.870] - Speaker 1
Because they intuitively, they're geniuses at understanding this. And that's all they see. They see an X-ray vision of the story past the beautiful production design, past everything, past the casting, everything, and they're just feeling this skeleton of the thing. So interesting. It is.

[00:04:33.560] - Speaker 2
I never heard it described this way before, so it's really fascinating.

[00:04:36.280] - Speaker 1
And what ends up happening is you as an author, can become resentful of this if you don't understand it. And so you find that you can have disdain for the audience, which is, I did level four, five, six, and seven, and eight so well, you idiots. And they're like, You don't get to do that. Where's level one? And it's fascinating because we're always in the present and we're always in the past and we're always in the future. As they're watching a story, they can't help if you introduce a war hero coming home to a Mafia family, and he's the innocent, and he's introducing his girlfriend to this family, we're with the innocent learning about the family, but already something has happened, which is there's one family member that's not in the business. So the story structure has begun in the godfather, and so it's beginning. And then ultimately, he will be the biggest and greatest godfather. It's just satisfying, incredible. Even if I'm not aware, I'm so titulated by the bone structure of it. And so in that example, which I love the godfather, they did everything on the pyramid. But Mario Pousseau started us with the skeleton, which is the innocent that becomes powerful and dark.

[00:05:54.940] - Speaker 1
And don't mess with me. Don't push me too far because I'll become this thing.

[00:06:02.710] - Speaker 2
So now, based on that, do you always start with the bone structure?

[00:06:09.720] - Speaker 1
Wow. So you can't think your way. I mean, a lot of executives do believe you can. For me, I don't want to think my way to it. I have to open up to the subconscious and the universe that it should just fall into place. The last movie, it's a dad and a daughter going to a concert. They realize there's a trap for a serial killer, and then you let in that he's the serial killer, the father. Then I'm like, the bone structure starts taking off of like... And it's a beautiful bone structure for me because the audience is like, now in the shoes of the antagonist, now, where does that go? Because now we have a new bone structure. So for me, the excitement is on honoring what I said to you, the pyramid, and inventing new bone structure.

[00:07:04.830] - Speaker 2
So the bone structure, it's not familiar because bone structures are so similar from movie to movie. You're not saying that.

[00:07:13.650] - Speaker 1
I'm not saying that, but there's an inevitability of the audience trying to... Make sense of it. Yeah, make sense of where they are in the story. And if they give up and now they're detached, that's a bad thing. You want that one-to-one with the character, that sinus curve that we're in sync with the character. You could take it anywhere. But underneath it... And so some people, for example, I don't know, pick any movie that's... In the old days, for example, the bone structure of the Exorcist is so interesting. They start out in a rock, and then you come to a little girls room in Georgetown, and then you build it slow. Something's wrong, something's wrong in the house. Something's wrong with the little girl. The mom's an actress and totally ill-equipped to handle this, but she's a mom, and we'll fight. And then the story of the priests, and then an older priest who's fought the devil, and then a younger one who doesn't quite believe. It's again set up for a beautiful bone structure to happen there. You can feel it growing. And yet you and I have never seen that before. But it's so strong.

[00:08:19.700] - Speaker 1
It knows itself. And then even at the ending of the exorcist of how he thwartz it and gets the girl to save the girl is so unexpected and beautiful, but inevitable from the bone structure.

[00:08:30.620] - Speaker 2
So would you say if the film knows itself, then the audience can get it?

[00:08:37.350] - Speaker 1
You're getting very close to this sublime thing that we're dancing around, that there is this... It's like whatever the veining on a leaf or something in nature that's just perfect, and yet each leaf is different. The audience feels it in those two examples that I gave of the exorcist and godfather, and you can feel that it was, wow, I've never felt that bone structure before, and yet it's perfect. It just moves. I sometimes describe it as you're in a relationship with this story. And so you can yell at it, you can talk over it, you can manhandle it, but that's not a healthy relationship. It's talking back to you. I believe maybe the end result of whether the relationship was a good relationship is in the bone structure. Ultimately, did you listen or did you jam it?

[00:09:36.170] - Speaker 2
Yeah. How different is your understanding of this now versus when you made whatever your very first project was?

[00:09:46.200] - Speaker 1
It was more intuitive when I started in my 20s. I couldn't articulate anything we're talking about, but I was just following it. I would sit and I would know the difference between artifice, emotional artifice, for me, not necessarily even the piece of art, and the connection to everything. I could feel that. And then, as always, experience helps you up to a certain point and then becomes your enemy because it's limiting.

[00:10:15.350] - Speaker 2
Because it's not always the same. Sometimes we think because it happened in the past, well, that's how it is. But it was that time. It may not be this next time.

[00:10:25.450] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:10:26.720] - Speaker 2
That's how you mean it's a limitation.

[00:10:28.550] - Speaker 1
I do. Something Sometimes I think, why does the songwriters who wrote the greatest songs of all time in their 20s can't do it in their 40s and 50s and 60s? What is that? It's probably, now we're going to get really philosophical, but are falling in love with the illusion that is this world, this society, and that we want at it. Now we're no longer really next to the open door anymore.

[00:11:01.370] - Speaker 2
It does feel like as soon as we think we know more than we do, things get dangerous. Not in a good way.

[00:11:12.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Maybe we're defining ourselves. We're putting ourselves in concrete in the illusion.

[00:11:18.850] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:11:19.440] - Speaker 1
And this is us. In so many forms of this, we talked about just now we referenced songwriters, but it could be what they call the Oscar curse or anything where you've defined yourself. You're no longer... The joy, this goes full circle to what we talked about. So the joy of rejection is you never fall in love with the illusion. You don't have that danger. So you're doing beautiful things. So a lot of us have done it on the fringe from the outside. It's a gift because the illusion is rejecting you.

[00:11:54.080] - Speaker 2
Would you say all of your work is biographical?

[00:11:59.010] - Speaker 1
Emotionally, yeah. It's wherever I am because I've initiated most of them myself, and I would say 85% of them are original stories that just came from my head. So they're just where I am. For example, the thing I'm writing now is romance, and I want it. I feel that way right now, maybe because it's such a cynical time that I want it. I want to believe in something as pure and innocent as that. Maybe others do, too. I've trusted that whatever I'm going through, someone else is going through and feeling these things.

[00:12:42.880] - Speaker 2
I think our best chance is if it's true to us, it's likely to be true to someone else. Other than, Well, this isn't really true to me, but this is how other people feel. It's impossible to know that.

[00:12:56.180] - Speaker 1
Yes. The analytics of that. I have We're just being totally transparent. We're here. I have a tough time being in Los Angeles, maybe because it's the site of commoditization of art and the discipline, the striving for systemization of it and repetition of it, and I get it. If you have to put out a certain amount of albums, a certain amount of movies every single year, you can't just wait for Michael Jordan. You have to make facsimilies of that.

[00:13:34.650] - Speaker 2
How do you do- But the idea to think everything is supposed to be a facsimile is a dangerous idea.

[00:13:38.870] - Speaker 1
It's an attempt to raise the floor. I get that. If you're here and you need to do that, and I get that. But my job, and that's what I think living 3,000 miles away has afforded me as a perspective of the illusion and the resistance of wanting to master the system to win by it.

[00:14:05.310] - Speaker 2
You seem to exist well outside of the system, and it's a beautiful thing to see. There are not so many people who have been able to do that.

[00:14:14.420] - Speaker 1
Something just happened before I came here, which was super positive, and something I wanted to happen and is happening, and it appears to be going really, really well. I was driving over here, and I'm not good at this. The system saying, Yeah, great. Take a seat at the table. I don't even know how to be right now, whereas I'm so built for, We don't think that's going to work. Oh, yeah?

[00:14:47.170] - Speaker 2
I'll show you.

[00:14:48.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I love it. You love it, right? I love that. Then I'm like, Oh, I'm fired. I can't wait to get to work and let's go.

[00:14:58.050] - Speaker 2
In some ways, if it's accepted too soon, maybe there's a feeling of you haven't gone far enough.

[00:15:04.840] - Speaker 1
I hope it's not rebellion. I think that's what you're referencing. I don't know. I hope not. It could be. I just felt a little bit untethered right now because of that, that acceptance. Getting the morsels from the illusion has been enough. And ironically, as I look back now in 30 years and My kids are in their 20s. I've been married for 31 years. I've made 17 movies. I wouldn't want it any other way. I'm here, and I feel like I could go for a long, long, long time. I can't keep I can live up with the ideas in my head. But you don't want to get used to rebellion for rebellion's sake. I'm trying to provoke. And there's amazing artists and stuff that do that. It's just the provocation. There was a musician that He said something to me once. This musician, everybody knows, and he said something very provocative to me. And I said, Hey, man, what do you want me to do with that statement? But I get how he is. He's provoking because he doesn't want a floor. He almost wants me to reject him in that moment and get the electricity going.

[00:16:17.860] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a challenge. Tell me about living in Philadelphia. Is that where you grew up?

[00:16:25.190] - Speaker 1
It is. I live outside Philly. We live for about 45 minutes outside Philly, but But go there all the time for date nights.

[00:16:32.190] - Speaker 2
So the way you didn't choose it, you were essentially born into your life in Philly. You grew up in it.

[00:16:39.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:16:41.430] - Speaker 2
And you stayed. So the choice you made was not to leave. Yes. Because you could also do what you do anywhere other than here and still be the outsider.

[00:16:51.840] - Speaker 1
Yes. Well, it represents so many things. I think it represents why my dad and mom, well, my dad, particularly when he came from India, said, We're going to Philadelphia. That's where they created everything, the Declaration of Independence. In his mind, that was America.

[00:17:09.710] - Speaker 2
The heart of the American idea. Yes. The American idea.

[00:17:13.050] - Speaker 1
So when he's leaving his home in India and the first of his family to do that, he's going towards something, an ideal that you can become anything. There's anything that's available to you. And he was right. And My advantage was being born to parents that believed in that and then being in the United States in Philadelphia. So it feels very beautiful to be there. And that mixture of having been born in Pondichéry, India, 10,000 miles away and living outside Philly and telling stories to everybody in between, it feels right. Yeah.

[00:17:59.260] - Speaker 2
Do you have a particular group of people that you tend to work with?

[00:18:03.620] - Speaker 1
This is an interesting subject because why the songwriter can't write their song or why that artist chose to provoke me is related. Is comfort the enemy of the artist? Again, it's a calibration inside. I tend to work with new people, and Not as like, Hey, Rick, we're not going to work together again. It's a feeling I'm totally open to working with you again if we did one movie, but I'm way open as well to finding someone brand new. And I don't mind hiring inexperienced people, people that have all done a small movie and they haven't done a big movie. They're, Well, come and do the score for my film. You live in Iceland. You only done one small thing, or, Come and edit my movie. I know you even haven't edited a movie yet.

[00:18:59.100] - Speaker 2
But you see in their work enough of a spark where you know this is someone I want to collaborate with.

[00:19:04.030] - Speaker 1
I'm excited to collaborate with. Exactly. They're closer to the open door than I am. They're not coming to me. They think that they're coming to me and learning from me, but I'm actually learning from them.

[00:19:15.420] - Speaker 2
Understood. It's beautiful. When a story comes, does the arc of the story come or does an element, maybe a scene? Tell me what comes to you first that is eventually becomes a movie.

[00:19:31.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think it was David Lynch that talked about this concept, which is there's a Rosetta Stone idea in there. In that, whatever it is, a moment, a scene, a line, a feeling of a character.

[00:19:46.410] - Speaker 2
But it could be a line.

[00:19:47.790] - Speaker 1
It could be anything. That Rosetta Stone idea has the answers to everything. Then it shoots out from there. I pictured this man named Rick. He lives here. Oh, why did How did he end up like that? Boom, and it goes, and then the plot comes. Ideally, plot comes from character. It evolves like, Oh, he's having trouble with his wife in Sixth Sense. He's having trouble talking to his wife. Well, what's wrong? What's wrong? Why can't he connect with his wife? Why can't he connect with his wife? Why can't he connect with his wife? And then you come up with the plot. That's actually how it happened in that movie.

[00:20:26.450] - Speaker 2
Interesting. So the character comes first.

[00:20:29.110] - Speaker 1
I think a lot of timesFor you. For me, yeah, inside out. There's other ways to do it. You can go, Hey, we're making a sequel. It has Tom Cruise. It has to have this much action. Then, Okay, let's figure out what the movie is. You can do it that way. I haven't done it that way. But I would bet, even though Those individuals that are excellent at that do it this way as well. And they can just take a deep breath and go, Okay, put aside the absolutes for a second. Let me think of a story. And then they think of a character in a spy thing and it blooms, and then it's well written, and it and then it connects to these other things.

[00:21:03.850] - Speaker 2
From the time that you have that first idea until you have a full vision of a movie, what period of time is that?

[00:21:14.820] - Speaker 1
When you say full vision, you mean in my head or you mean a finished movie?

[00:21:17.940] - Speaker 2
Not a finished movie. To where you feel like we're ready to start making the movie.

[00:21:23.230] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's in phases. I'm a writer first. That's it. I don't think with that visual mind, really.

[00:21:31.430] - Speaker 2
You'd say you were a writer first and a director second.

[00:21:34.080] - Speaker 1
Correct. That's interesting. Yeah. And then the director is trying to figure out why the writer wrote it the way he wrote it. Yes.

[00:21:41.300] - Speaker 2
As a writer, you're writing the story true to the story. And then as the director, you don't change anything that the writer wrote because it's a better shot or a better film. The director's job is to execute the writer's work.

[00:22:00.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Why does that scene work? Why did the writer start it when that character said that? Why did he not talk about the other thing that's in the room? Why didn't they, Well, he's denying it. Oh, how do I show that? He's denying the fact that the body is sitting there. This is great. I can have it out of focus. And you see a visual way to depict what the writer did by what he wrote, meaning me, what I wrote or what I didn't write.

[00:22:27.250] - Speaker 2
How different are those hats, your writer's hat and your director's hat?

[00:22:31.940] - Speaker 1
They're different. In this one there, obviously, because the writer-directors, there's a harmony there. I'm that way when I'm adapting, even when I'm writing someone else. It was on television when I did Servant. If someone else wrote the scripts, I honor it. I don't try to one-up it. I'm trying to create resonance from what they wrote.

[00:22:55.030] - Speaker 2
Do you ever look back on... When's the last time you saw Sixth Sense, for example?

[00:23:03.140] - Speaker 1
They had, I think, a charity screening of it for... It's 25 years or something like that, and I got to see it with my kids, and one of them hadn't seen it, the little one.

[00:23:14.710] - Speaker 2
When you watched it then. Did you have any new insight into the film that you didn't have when you made it?

[00:23:21.240] - Speaker 1
This is touching another thing. Maybe this is a tangent, so it may not be too productive, but some directors go and they and they change their movie after 20 years and re-release it. I'm going to remix it. I'm going to add these things. I'm going to put in great CGI and all that stuff. Every single time, they're ruining it. Every single time. There is just a fugue state that we get into, a mastery of this language that only exists at that time as the person that you are at that moment. So I'm watching it in some ways, like when you're watching Six Sets, I'm watching a 28-year-old version of myself. 27, 28, 25 when I wrote a mid to late 20s version of myself. And him at the door to the universe. Not me now in my 50s. It's a wondrous thing. I'm about to show my kids my very, very first movie that I did when I was 21, which I bought and I had and I just restored it.

[00:24:29.590] - Speaker 2
It's Restored it, but didn't change it.

[00:24:31.980] - Speaker 1
No. Technically, brought it up to today. Technically, made sure that it was colored and here it is so that can present it. I was watching it with the color Timer, and I was dazzled at this. It's, in my opinion, terrible, empirically terrible. But yet the kid, the 21-year-old, and the time that it was, 1993, It was so different. It's like another time period. The way that I thought you could talk that earnestly and be that sentimental, that was okay. That was cool. I was like, Man, that kid. I admire his naivete and his innocence. I want to protect him when I see it.

[00:25:22.170] - Speaker 2
How much has your approach changed over the years from then to now?

[00:25:29.920] - Speaker 1
It's Strangely similar. I mean, just a creature of habit. I mean, very similar. This next movie I'm doing. It'll have the same cadence. There's this weird thing that I had when we say cadence, like sixth Sense, You might look at the back of a Blu-ray and see this slightly differently, but this is the truth. The 6 Cent is 107 minutes. Unbreakable is 107 minutes. Science is 107 minutes. The Village is 107 minutes. And how is that possible?

[00:26:00.290] - Speaker 2
That was unintentional? Unintended. That's unbelievable.

[00:26:03.090] - Speaker 1
Unintended. I think that's something, again, with the vaning of the leaves and the thing about nature and how we are, that maybe math and rhythm is more related. What we think of as art and science or math is more related than we think. You can do an analysis going, Well, that's the way you hear the rhythm of the way you talk and the way it bounces off the audience and how much they can take and how fast they want to hear the way you talk. But it is fascinating. But to answer your question, it's fairly similar. I write the first drafts and I give myself six weeks to do it from the outline. And in the outline begins after I've committed emotionally to getting a notebook where I fill it with ideas. And when that notebook has enough ideas, I go to the outline.

[00:26:57.190] - Speaker 2
And the ideas, random ideas, it's not...

[00:27:00.040] - Speaker 1
It's not linear. It's random ideas and contradictory ideas. He lives, he dies.

[00:27:04.460] - Speaker 2
It could be like this, it could be like this, it could be like that.

[00:27:07.270] - Speaker 1
Whatever. That process of free association is important, again, to get to the door. Stop thinking.

[00:27:15.330] - Speaker 2
You do this by yourself?

[00:27:16.180] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:27:16.960] - Speaker 2
Do you sit at a desk? Tell me about physically how this happens.

[00:27:22.700] - Speaker 1
That's also a game of psychology. I have as many places to sit and write in my house and in my office as I can. Maybe it's me hiding from my demons or whatever, but in that seat, it's coming to me. And maybe that's superstition, sitting in the same seat during a baseball game every single time because they won the first time. But it could be as rudimentary and primitive as that. But regardless, it's a placebo that works. So that area, the way I sit and look. And I have a tendency of looking up that you look up and you're emotionally That's scientific in the sense.

[00:28:01.360] - Speaker 2
Is that where the imagination is?

[00:28:03.900] - Speaker 1
For whatever reason as human beings, and a doctor could probably explain this better or someone that knows the brain, but as you look down, you have darker thoughts, and as you look up, you have lighter thoughts. It's why we look up when we're trying to stop crying. And your brain goes into a different mode. And so I think when I sit up, there's actually even a reclining position in bed. Right before I go to bed, I read before I go to bed. And whatever that angle is, that 45, and then my head's against the door, but I'm looking up at this corner of the ceiling, I can see everything. I get, Gosh, I'm write that down, write that down, write that down. Oh, I have to say this. I have to call Rick. I have to do this, this, and then get 20 things. But the rest of the time, it's convoluted. And so I'm very open to that. Then also when I'm... For example, in that exact example, when I'm reading it, I think often because I'm reading, especially if I'm reading something I'm very inspired by, by an artist that's writing with inspiration and precision, I will glimpse the answers to the thing that I'm working on, almost like it's on the other side of the book because it's happening simultaneously.

[00:29:16.080] - Speaker 1
I'm going, Oh, I know what to do now. I know that thing. But I'm reading a completely unrelated story. It's just that they're reminding me how to get to the door again. Yes.

[00:29:27.710] - Speaker 2
It's amazing how If you have a question you're trying to solve or problem you're trying to solve, if you just pay attention to what's going on around you for some reason, more often than not, it seems like the answer comes. You're told it.

[00:29:45.980] - Speaker 1
If you believe in the brain waves and things like that, that when we're in flight or fight, you're constricted. When we're about to fall asleep, like I was just saying, you're just not in that headspace. You see everything. You're free. You're free. It just dances and finds it and grabs it and brings it to you. That might be that when we're here in your studio and if it's flat or in it's fired, you can panic. Now you're in fight or flight. Now you're in the wrong wavelengths to connect with everything. It's very important in terms of... That's why early in our careers, it's much easier because the system has completely rejected you. You're not even really connected.

[00:30:36.000] - Speaker 2
You're not considering them.

[00:30:36.810] - Speaker 1
You're not considering them, right? Then later, when you've won and they've anointed you in the system, wow, you can't get to the door anymore.

[00:30:47.680] - Speaker 2
Are you superstitious in general?

[00:30:51.450] - Speaker 1
Yes. I'm very much like, you come to our house, I'm very much. I have photos of everything, photos of every moment in our family, like a church, to the life that we've had. You come in and it's like, there's the 16th birthday, there's the 30th birthday. That's the thing. That's the vacation we took. It sounds normal, but it is a, strangely, like a shrine to gratefulness. The other day, I was walking to my office and all my movie posters are there, and I'm walking up the stairs to go to my office to work. God, I'm so grateful. By the time I got to the top of the stairs, I was like, I don't how to thank whoever for this opportunity. And yet every step along the way, I felt like I was suffering.

[00:31:37.830] - Speaker 2
Do you think that the pictures and the posters are there to remind you of something?

[00:31:47.150] - Speaker 1
Yeah, they are because... Well, again, they're the things that I hold sacred, which is the family and our friends that are in those photos, the curation of a life and that it's not passive and it's you're the artist, and the car wreck can happen to you. It does happen to all of us. What you do in the next moment, then using that color in the most beautiful way. And I guess I just... When I have go through really bad periods, like when something bad is happening to me or something, I'm not constricted by the fear of the bad thing happening to me when things are going really well. It's classic, classic feeling.

[00:32:37.130] - Speaker 2
What would be an example of something bad happening?

[00:32:41.390] - Speaker 1
When I worked for Harvey, that was a tough time when I was a kid. It was dark and I felt no agency. But yet again, in retrospect, getting to spar with the darkest person in our industry as a kid. It makes you strong. Yeah.

[00:33:09.850] - Speaker 2
What's your first memory of going to the movies?

[00:33:17.220] - Speaker 1
One memory has obliterated the others, which was seven and seeing Star Wars.

[00:33:23.020] - Speaker 2
They were probably movies pre-Star Wars, but Star Wars was so important that it took over.

[00:33:28.780] - Speaker 1
It took over. I became a different person on that day. It was what I assume people feel with religious zealots, what you feel. You felt reborn. Yeah. I felt this is truthful. In some universal answers, this is seven-year-old mindset. This makes sense. I'm in. I don't mean in a video game way. I'm in in a religion way. Yeah. Whatever. Cosmic. Yeah, Yes. Whoever was this, and I didn't know George. I was just seven years old, right? You don't know who any of these people are. Or Joseph Conrad. You don't know anything, but you know whoever did this on an intuitive level knows the truth. And so that was what I was feeling in the car, in the station wagon on the way home. I wanted to feel it again.

[00:34:25.960] - Speaker 2
Did you have any of the figures?

[00:34:27.720] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I still have them. I have them in a little box, the ones I had in seven, eight. They're there. They're sacred.

[00:34:36.280] - Speaker 2
What was the next movie experience where it was like game changer for you?

[00:34:43.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that would be Raiders. That would be Raiders. It was also because I think the universe had me go. We went there. I didn't know what archeology was. I didn't want to go. I remember that feeling because I thought it was some science thing, and I didn't want to go. You went with your parents? No, I went with my friend. Parents dropped us off.

[00:35:07.230] - Speaker 2
In Star Wars, you went with your parents?

[00:35:08.300] - Speaker 1
I did. Parents and my sister. But my parents obviously dropped me off at the theater in the Narbour Theater, and we were waiting in line. It was huge line outside to see it. We get in there. It's an old theater. I think it's that 2000 or something, or 2000. It was a huge theater, an old-fashioned with all the orientation and everything. Yeah, absolutely beautiful. It's the best. Yeah. And couldn't sit next to each other because there was no seats available. Terrified. I mean, I was a real shy kid. Really, this was terror on a scale that was, I don't know what to do. And there's no phones, there's nothing. You can't call My parents said, No. My friend says, I sit down and there's a couple next to me and they see I'm very scared. I'm very holding my hands. I'm very scared. And they're like, You okay? I'm like, I'm okay. And they went to get a popcorn and thing, and they gave me it. I was like, Thank you. I was sitting there. And then the lights go down and then the mountain starts, the logo, and then the logo turns into a real mountain.

[00:36:09.140] - Speaker 1
And again, without knowing, you know, going, whoa. Again, we're talking two of the masters that were telling it. They're the game-changing ones. How lucky was I to experience that? Then came out of it and it was changed. I was like, I got to keep doing this. Then it became a version of play to do that. Then, hey, can I- To act out the movies? Yeah. Then you're acting it out, acting it out, and then taking my dad's camera and saying, Hey, can I do this? The these guys are doing this. How do you do this? And then playing with the camera.

[00:36:49.650] - Speaker 2
How old were you when you started playing with the camera?

[00:36:51.780] - Speaker 1
That age, 10 to 12. Taking my dad's camera. Then in that era, the video camera started to come, the VHS and the Betamax camera. But they were huge and they were plugged into your actual beta max.

[00:37:03.880] - Speaker 2
At first was it 8 millimeter?

[00:37:05.240] - Speaker 1
It was 8 millimeter, yeah.

[00:37:06.210] - Speaker 2
So you started in film?

[00:37:08.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah, absolutely. That sound was so satisfying. They went in the camera and then the play is so wonderful. The thing you did for fun everywhere. At 15, then you read a book that there's a guy named Spike Lee, and he goes to a school called the Tisch School of the Arts, and you can go learn how to become a filmmaker. And I was like, I can do the play thing as a career.

[00:37:35.630] - Speaker 2
Was there anything else you ever wanted to do besides filmmaking?

[00:37:39.320] - Speaker 1
I loved athletics, so that was always fantasy of playing tennis or whatever it was. But this was really the sole career thing. It was you just know. And so your brain is just, Oh, that's all you're thinking about. And I say that when people come to me now, and my wife will have a different answer to or a comment on this subject. But when people come up to me and go, Are you going to take a break? There's so much assumption in that statement, and I get it. The assumption from the person that's asking that is you've constructed your life in a way that you have to do something, and then you're doing that to do the other thing. And so you should take a break from the thing you have to do so you can do the things that you want to do. There's an assumption because most everyone on the planet is doing that. I'm You're so lucky.

[00:38:30.980] - Speaker 2
You're doing the thing you want to do.

[00:38:32.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. If it was yoga or painting- Whatever it is. Yeah. The thing that gives you absolute peace and connection to the world is the thing that I get paid to do. Sometimes I pretend. I go, Yeah, I'm going to take a vacation soon. But then I hate myself for that answer.

[00:38:51.400] - Speaker 2
Do you have a passionate connection to anything else besides film and your family?

[00:38:59.760] - Speaker 1
Sports. Yeah, I do. I've done- Watching or playing? Playing, yeah. I play basketball all the time. Fun. Yeah. Both my knees, I have two ACLs, both done from basketball, the therapy, the whole thing, all in. And then as an exercise, to carve yourself, your discipline and connection, and I learn about myself.

[00:39:24.080] - Speaker 2
Tell me something about writing something that someone else directs.

[00:39:28.610] - Speaker 1
Oh, yes. I wrote Stuart and then another person directed it.

[00:39:32.140] - Speaker 2
What's that like?

[00:39:34.640] - Speaker 1
That one was good and okay because it was almost like a semi-animated thing because there were live-action people in that. But because it's almost another art form, the animation thing, and it's not something that I'm motivated or know how to do, it was totally fine and wondrous to do. I guess I went into it wanting to write something for our child that wasn't born yet. So I was like, Let me write this for whoever this is. And so it came out in that innocence way, and I felt good about it. And then I enjoyed the movie, the tone of the movie, which I would have never leaned it like that. But I really enjoyed its place.

[00:40:16.050] - Speaker 2
Were you surprised with the choices made when you saw them?

[00:40:19.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and that is the beauty, right? Everybody's bringing their own color to the table and pressing in a different way. And in my head, when I was writing it, it had a more of a classicism and more of an emotion. And then when it was made, it had this really colorful, colorful voyancy to it, which is absolutely lovely.

[00:40:42.860] - Speaker 2
Do you think going to a Catholic school impacted your creative choices?

[00:40:49.720] - Speaker 1
For sure.

[00:40:50.690] - Speaker 2
In what way?

[00:40:51.510] - Speaker 1
I mean, just look, I did, Knock of the Cabin is a biblical story. And Servant, four years on the Apple thing, number one show is about angels. And it's there. The mythology that I went to school with is one of the mythologies I use as genre. There's ghosts, and then there's aliens, and super heroes, and there's the religion.

[00:41:21.650] - Speaker 2
Are there ghosts? What do you think?

[00:41:28.140] - Speaker 1
I'll answer after, What do you think? I'm really curious about you.

[00:41:30.900] - Speaker 2
I think yes. Do you think they're aliens?

[00:41:35.000] - Speaker 1
I definitely do. That's just mathematically impossible that they're- Does ESP exist?

[00:41:42.410] - Speaker 2
Can someone read your mind?

[00:41:48.180] - Speaker 1
Pretty close. Probably pretty close.

[00:41:50.490] - Speaker 2
Can we become invisible?

[00:41:55.940] - Speaker 1
Oh, man. You mean in the way that... It's funny you said that because I just thought of a movie idea. It worked. It worked, yeah. Is there a way that you can forget things that I do and say, even though we're right here and I'm making that happen? Yeah, I think so. It's probably some movement of energy that's not being present or something.

[00:42:21.450] - Speaker 2
Can we levitate?

[00:42:23.180] - Speaker 1
I love to believe that. I was that kid that just kept on looking at the cup or the pencil and says, I can make it move. I can make it move. I swear today I still look at it and I go, I think I can make it move.

[00:42:34.260] - Speaker 2
That's called psychokinesis.

[00:42:35.760] - Speaker 1
Yes. But it hasn't happened yet.

[00:42:43.640] - Speaker 2
What percentage of the ideas that you have come to fruition?

[00:42:49.050] - Speaker 1
A high percentage. Every film idea that I've had since puberty has been either made or been offered to be made. And so I don't really develop like that. I have a lot of ideas. They're in notebooks, but they're just literally like a one line or one line like that. And they'll speak to me at the right time or not. But for example, it's just I'm committed to it. I'm fully committed. And so the tornado of effort and energy that I'm going to now bring and I'm going to, by sheer will, make a movie exist in universe no matter what. I'm able to turn it on in that way to just bring it to... Manifest it. Manifest it, no matter what.

[00:43:39.950] - Speaker 2
Can you work on more than one project at the same time?

[00:43:45.940] - Speaker 1
Not directing. Not directing. Not two movies, let's say. I've done a TV show and a movie at the same time when I'm doing one small episode, but I didn't write that episode. So it's a different part of me a little bit that does that. It was really interesting working on continuation of someone else's idea in a TV show because sometimes art allows you to be more honest about yourself because you're not being you. And so I can write a male character that has flaws that I'm like, Oh, he has those flaws, but really, I have those flaws. Or she, who's a proxy for me, it feels this way about the world. Oh, that's so poignant she Well, then that's me that feels that way. But I can't be that honest even with myself about it. It's a beautiful aspect of it. Sometimes I feel like even when I trick myself into going, Well, this is not mine. If you had to me, Hey, help me with that. And then I start coming up with it. You're getting a part of me that's not protective or tight. I'm coming from a very free, loving space. Sometimes I trick myself.

[00:44:56.800] - Speaker 1
Even the movie that I'm writing right now, in fact, So the last two, I've tricked myself into going, Oh, that's for someone else. Because I genuinely thought I was going to just have this idea and someone else was going to do it and I'd produce it.

[00:45:09.540] - Speaker 2
Will you allow things to happen that you wouldn't allow to happen if you're protecting it for yourself?

[00:45:18.150] - Speaker 1
Probably, yeah. I was going to say some... I couldn't form what I'm about to say, but maybe you can connect the dots. I know in like Juilliard and things, they have this class where you wear masks and then you perform and then you immediately take on this other thing. And maybe it's a version of that, that I'm wearing someone else's mask, so I'm free. I'm not me, so I'm free. And then you're doing something that feels really great and you want to continue it. Now you have to take off the mask to continue it.

[00:45:48.080] - Speaker 2
What do you think you're best at?

[00:45:52.510] - Speaker 1
Seeing talent in others. I love it. I love it. I'm so inspired by it. And that could be anything. Of course, it can be the artist, the singer, the costume designer, whatever. But it could also be the waiter and going, wow, the invention that is you is amazing. And in this moment when you're having your light is shining, and this is incredible, and you're teaching all of us and guiding us in that way. But I'm so endlessly inspired by everything. And so seeing, if you're going just in the movies, seeing a movie and saying, my gosh, the photography, or who did the costumes on that? Oh, there's this lady who lives in Bulgaria, and I have to work with her.

[00:46:44.090] - Speaker 2
So you build the best team because you recognize regardless of the context that it's coming from, you can say, Whoever did that, they're really good.

[00:46:53.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Having the humility to know that it's not a static position of you are good, you are bad, you are connected, you're not. When I meet an actor who has an incredible or she has an incredible body of work, it's the meeting the person is really to say, Where are you today? That's it. Obviously, you've done these beautiful inspired things with the universe, but where are you today? The place where you are today as a human being and where I am, is that together going to make us make this beautiful fictional creature How difficult is it working with actors? I love it, especially the way I make movies. It's unusual in that it's very, in theory, one could from a far away, say, It's so prescriptive.

[00:47:46.860] - Speaker 2
Tell me what it is. How do you do it?

[00:47:48.640] - Speaker 1
I write the thing, and that's the words we're saying.

[00:47:53.120] - Speaker 2
No adlibbing.

[00:47:54.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, it's very, very rare to do that. The reason I didn't write Um, there was a reason. So don't say Um. It's a painting of colors. And then from there, it's the director on the side of me and the storyboard artist, we draw every single shot out, and that's what we're shooting. And so that sounds very limiting. And why would you that? Why aren't you being open?

[00:48:19.150] - Speaker 2
How well do you know what the film is going to look like before you shoot it?

[00:48:22.700] - Speaker 1
I mean, identical. Really? Yeah. That's amazing. Like an animated movie. Wow. Yeah. You could come and I could show you each movie, and Like an anime, like a graphic novel, you could watch it. And then so you go, why I said from a distance, that sounds incredibly restrictive and prohibitive. And yet with that honest and months and months of painting those things, things. The actors come in. First of all, they already know that it's already... They've heard me. I've done it so many times. Then they say, Okay, this is the way we're doing this particular dance. Then I come in and then they realize, wow, it's infinite the way you can play based on these factors, that the camera is moving on this line because it represents your anger. If you don't get angry, the camera is not going to move. You have to choose it. The pace of the way the camera is moving towards you is predicated on how fast and how angry you get. And that's what I'm going to tell the operator, you're not listening because you just did a move that was even. And that's not what the character did.

[00:49:24.170] - Speaker 1
That's not what the actor did. The actor did this sinus move of holding back, holding back, and then burst. But you didn't do that. So stare at her eyes. And then they go, Oh, my God. And that was thought of three months ago. And they get it as that it's a three-dimensional medium. And that, again, the choices of how to play are infinite. And then that being held by thought, not capriciousness or restriction for restriction's sake. It wasn't. It was an inspired… This is the visual script for the words, and now we're going to add life to it. This is the frame of the painting. Now, fill it with the messier, more real, great. If I'm pushing and then the actress gets angry and her head goes out for a second and comes in, great. Great. It's that frame is just... Because when we see a painting, we take it in. The frame is also critical to our emotion about the painting.

[00:50:30.460] - Speaker 2
When did you first start working that way?

[00:50:32.810] - Speaker 1
That was 6 Cent. And that came from a thesis of watching one of the scenes in my movie at Miramax and going, wow, that's the only scene that works. Why is that? And then breaking down, oh, that's what I did in that scene. That's what the camera did. Interesting. Oh, wow. That's also in Psycho. Oh, that's also in, and pick whatever movie, ET. It's also in And you're going, this principle of the art form of the visual, because it's all art forms together. So honoring it. And I say that we cannot defer to one art form only. Even that art form is acting. That's one part of it. It's in a dance with everything else. It is also dance. So the blocking is so critical. It is poetry. So the words that is so important. It's light, painting with light. It's costumes. We keep going. It's all art forms together, so critical.

[00:51:36.760] - Speaker 2
Tell me the whole process. From the time you have the script.

[00:51:39.680] - Speaker 1
I have this script, let's say, and then the next person is a storyboard artist who then comes and we spend about three months storyboarding. During that time-That's when you're essentially making the movie. Yes, in my head. We also, at that time, if it's location-dependent, and oftentimes it is, you can draw from finding the locations to enhance the visuals of that.

[00:52:06.770] - Speaker 2
Typically, real locations or sets?

[00:52:09.060] - Speaker 1
If I can't find it, then we make it. You'll see movies- But you defer to relocation if you can? I don't know if I'd say that. Okay. I don't know if I'd say that. For example, if you look at signs or six sense or unbreakable, everything was built. So built the train even. And it's because I see the camera doing this and this and this and turning to the left. Well, there is no bedroom to the left. Well, we're going to make a bedroom to the left. And it's a part of the art form. So if you see another person who does that, it would be like in Parasite. When the table is where the table is. Have you seen Parasite? I'm not. Absolutely incredible. Absolutely incredible movie. And there's a stairs and a door that's critical in the kitchen. And it's right at the end of the table. And there's stairs that go down. You're not going to find that house. So he built it. And why is it so critical is the way all the shots that he came up and how he saw it. And that creates a specificity of an audience experience because they know without knowing Oh, my God, the table's here and the thing here, and it creates this beautiful composition.

[00:53:19.330] - Speaker 1
And this man's coming up in his head first in his eyes. And then you go, wow, it's possible to find that. But I built it. We built a lot of it. And even when I have a location like with the visit, because it was super low budget and all, I rented a house for a year where we were going to shoot it. And so I just sat in the house. And I had to move my brain around a bit to make it work in the same way, but then I made each shot from that.

[00:53:48.090] - Speaker 2
Did you know the house before you storyboarded it?

[00:53:49.830] - Speaker 1
No, in that case, because I knew I had to find the house first because I didn't have the money to build this house. So that was the first movie that I funded myself. I was like, I just got to find a house and we just need to be able to rent it so we can shoot and reshoot and all that stuff. Then I just sat in this empty house and worked out all the shots.

[00:54:12.540] - Speaker 2
Okay, so the storyboard happens. What happens next?

[00:54:15.550] - Speaker 1
And then you go. By that point, you're overlapping into pre-production, which is then everyone starts coming. All the crew members start arriving. You've already casted? Yes. That would be on route during the storyboarding process and then dovetailing into pre-production. The casting trickles through that period.

[00:54:33.280] - Speaker 2
Typically, how many main characters are there?

[00:54:36.570] - Speaker 1
It really varies. A movie like Old is so many people. It's a collective experience. The one I'm doing now has really two main characters. It can vary dramatically.

[00:54:51.900] - Speaker 2
Okay, so what happens next?

[00:54:53.400] - Speaker 1
Then preproduction and all the crews come, and then it becomes very much almost like a military operation. There's all my assistant directors and everyone, and every minute of the day is filled. You need to meet with the art department to decide this. You need to go to locations to pick the ice cream shop where the thing is happening. You got to go visit seven ice cream shots or they're building you the bedroom downstairs. You need to go look at it. Every moment is covered. Okay, got to meet the prop guy, on and on. Then you're going to go to costumes, and then you're going to talk through. They want to walk through these characters today, and boom, boom, boom, boom, like that.

[00:55:29.880] - Speaker 2
What happens after that? Next phase.

[00:55:31.760] - Speaker 1
That builds to the highest intensity till day one of shooting. That gets more and more and more intense. During that latter part of pre-production, as you're getting very close to shooting in those last two weeks, that's when rehearsals, actors arrive. I see. We rehearse and rehearse and talk about philosophy and try to get to know each other in that trust way.

[00:55:52.570] - Speaker 2
Do you shoot the films in order or not necessarily?

[00:55:55.970] - Speaker 1
I try to as much in order as humanly possible. It's not that you have to do it that way, but again, when you're trying to do something so precise, I'm not sure what her anger is yet in scene 47 until we've done scene 32. With her and I working through, is her anger being presented as detachment? We might decide that. Mostly, you would probably get there in rehearsals, but you might crystallize that realization in scene 32. Oh, she shuts down when she gets really, really angry, and it's scary. Then in '47, when she runs in, it's either a break from that style, and then you have to play that. Now, I'm going to burst from being at this place. So it's so much more helpful to go in order for me, but it's not impossible. It's really impractical to do it that way. Say there's three scenes here in the room that we're in. We can't keep coming in and out of your house to keep shooting it. So you try to shoot all three scenes. But I try as hard as I can to keep it for you guys, the actors, as in continuity as possible.

[00:57:06.490] - Speaker 2
Do you ever consider in the writing phase the practicality of the shooting?

[00:57:12.190] - Speaker 1
I do. It's inherently because I love I love minimalism, and I love containment. So I'm always, anyway, thinking that way in insinuation. And a long, zillion years ago, they had offered me a movie called Troy, which was made in this big, wonderful way. But when they sent me the script and I was looking at it and I was like, Okay, so we have... Maybe I can have two guys fighting and there could be a wall behind them, an old wall. And then the real battle with a thousand soldiers on the outside, on the other side of the wall, and you're only hearing it. And it's just between these two guys. So we could do the battle, and you could glimpse it through a little moment through the wall, but that's it. That's really interesting. Immediately, my mind started going to the minimal version, the insinuitive version of a giant battle movie. Yeah. But I like that. That I believe in it.

[00:58:08.600] - Speaker 2
You think it's the intimacy or the personal nature of two big people on the screen instead of 50 people or 100 or 1,000 people on the screen?

[00:58:17.550] - Speaker 1
My brain just does not work that way. When all of these amazing artists like Cameron and Spielberg and all these guys, they can see that big, wonderful, complicated thing, I just panic. I'm so titulated by the idea of incompleteness. I love that. I'm just showing you a part of the painting. Yeah.

[00:58:44.850] - Speaker 2
Have you ever considered directing theater or writing for theater? Definitely.

[00:58:49.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I feel most of my movies could be plays. I've really thought about it a lot about whether to just take six months or a year and go write a play and see how that feels to just rely on the blocking and the written word to do most of the storytelling. I mean, you can use other aspects, of course. It's very innovative these days, but fear is probably just stopping me.

[00:59:15.850] - Speaker 2
How would you describe your demeanor on the set?

[00:59:19.840] - Speaker 1
A mixture of temperaments. I would say it moves from highly concentrated and quiet. My wife and pop would just say anxious, but- Do you feel anxious? I find the making of a movie matches my anxiety really well, becomes a superpower because my mind can go to the next shot's this, you need to set up that, whisper to the gaffer this, whisper that, do that, saying, Okay, we need to do this. Oh, this sweater is the... I have an idea for the next thing with the sweater she's wearing. But in my mind, it's buzzing and I can use it to an advantage, whereas in regular life, you have to calm it and say, Stop playing chess. Whereas on the set, playing chess at 100 miles an hour is great. I'm super efficacious. You're pounding all that energy. So I'll say something like to the ADs, everybody knows my thing, which is, Hey, we're going to be ready. I think the actress should be here when we're ready, as opposed to, We're ready, call the actress. That doesn't work like that. And I'll explain to the actress why. That's the case that they should be waiting on the hundred of us, not the hundred of us waiting on the one person.

[01:00:36.400] - Speaker 1
And I say, I'll use an example like, Hey, let's say I say, I say, Well, shot's ready. Okay, we call that person. They come, they get off their phone in the trailer, they go to the bathroom, they walk over, come to the set. Let's say they do it really fast, five minutes. Five minutes. Okay, what's the problem? It's five minutes. Twelve shots a day, five minutes, one hour. I just lost one hour. The At the end of the week, you lost five hours. In two weeks, you lost a day of shooting. And you need that day. That day of shooting. You lost a day of shooting. What? We're not doing that. And so when I walked through why we're doing it.

[01:01:12.150] - Speaker 2
What hours do you work?

[01:01:14.200] - Speaker 1
Well, it depends if it's outdoors or nighttime and things like that. But if it's normal, if it's a stage work, I try to do... We're shooting by 7: 00 or 7: 30, and then we can finish early. I do try to do 10-hour days.

[01:01:27.220] - Speaker 2
What is early? 10-hour day?

[01:01:28.630] - Speaker 1
I try to do 10 hours. Recently, I've done it outside the country, and we've done 10 hours straight, where they're more used to doing you eat while you stand, and then you finish, and everybody goes home early. But here, we don't do that as much. Where have you done that?

[01:01:42.810] - Speaker 2
What countries have you worked in outside of the US?

[01:01:44.690] - Speaker 1
We did the last movie we did in Canada, and then my daughter's movie we did in Ireland, and that was wonderful. Then we did a movie in the Dominican called Old, and all of those we did those straight 10-hour days.

[01:01:56.910] - Speaker 2
You mentioned the first movie that you funded yourself. Tell me what led to that happening.

[01:02:02.560] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:02:03.610] - Speaker 2
How many movies did you make before that?

[01:02:06.380] - Speaker 1
I don't know. Maybe that's 10 or something like that. There was a period where I was thinking that the fear and the Getting the morsels from the system were indicators that I wasn't doing it right. So let me find a way to join the system because everyone is tacitly saying, doing, do it the normal way, do it the normal way. Go do it the normal way. And then there's so many rewards for doing it the normal way. And you could just Coast and do it. So I think there was a period of time where I joined the system, tried to join the system.

[01:02:46.140] - Speaker 2
And that was for the first 10?

[01:02:47.660] - Speaker 1
No, it was in the middle period. In this middle period. That first period was... It was a different era in filmmaking. It was a different time in the studio system because they really were making original movies. And The system was geared towards that. So there was a lot of us doing.

[01:03:05.120] - Speaker 2
Was that still a leftover from the revolution of the Raging Bull, Easy Riders?

[01:03:10.440] - Speaker 1
Probably.

[01:03:11.140] - Speaker 2
Late '70s.

[01:03:12.490] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it still went through the '90s. Yeah. That right till there. And then it started to change.

[01:03:17.220] - Speaker 2
Independent-minded movies.

[01:03:18.880] - Speaker 1
Yes. And that's what it was. You need to find the next great new story and new storyteller. That was what the system was built for. And then from there, right when the 2000s started till now, it has become an addiction of being familiar. The framing is more important than the painting. And maybe that's indicative of how fast things are going and people need to feel okay. There must be a wonderful reason, a healing reason that saying the second movie or the third movie makes you feel really, Okay, good. I know what I'm going to get. I'm going to go in there. That wasn't the case. Prior to 2000s. You had your outliers, but generally speaking, it was fresh. Yeah, so that first group was still coming off of the original blockbuster stuff that was really free and working. And then, again, as I said, I think I was feeling this, Hey, maybe you don't have to be as exposed, and maybe it doesn't have to be this hard. And maybe there's a way that you can be accept it because everybody's telling you that. Just do it this way. Just join the system. Do it that way.

[01:04:36.510] - Speaker 1
I guess in music, it would be just put that voice box thing on whatever it is, that sound that everybody has. It's just How do you do it? That's the sound of today. You go, Oh, maybe I'm being arrogant. I tried to join the system in that middle area, and I'm not good at it, and I don't know how to do it.

[01:04:58.850] - Speaker 2
It's also not why you started doing it. You didn't get into it for that.

[01:05:05.410] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, that was a, probably, if you're being very honest, I'm being honest, it's probably more of a reward-centered behavior, which is pathetic, that I just want the rewards or the safety or the concomitant, positive things that can happen by being in the system. But the beauty that came from that was I wasn't happy at all. I wasn't good at it. And that brought clarity. And then, as I told you, I get very ignited when people give up and they go, he can't do that or he can't do that anymore or whatever it is. And they come up with a statement. I love it. So then I was like, I used to think if I was an NBA player, would I have in my contract a clause that says I'm allowed to play streetball? Most, they have the opposite, which is you're not allowed to do any of those sports because we're paying for you.

[01:06:06.600] - Speaker 2
You might get hurt and that would impact everything.

[01:06:09.130] - Speaker 1
Yes. So in this metaphor, I was like, Well, let's go just go play streetball. So no one asked me to make a movie. In fact, I'm going to make a movie that they say won't succeed. Everyone's going to be their older child, and I'm going to make it super funny and scary, which they said can't be done. It just can't. Those two things can't exist. The not having been connected to the illusion or connected to the system freed me to do it differently. I was so happy. When we were making this, before we sold it, before everything, I was really happy making that movie to visit.

[01:06:50.140] - Speaker 2
The one before that was a big studio picture?

[01:06:53.880] - Speaker 1
That's correct, yeah. I didn't have really, ultimately, the say in that picture to make it what I want. But I want to be really clear, that's cop-out, because at any moment, I could have walked away, and I didn't.

[01:07:09.770] - Speaker 2
But you're also not a quitter, so I understand.

[01:07:11.370] - Speaker 1
No, yes. But in today's vernacular, now the way I am, as soon as I realize the situation is fraught with artifice or an inability for us to do the soul searching and conversation that you and I are having, I'm Yeah.

[01:07:31.730] - Speaker 2
So you decide to fund the movie yourself. Yeah.

[01:07:34.440] - Speaker 1
So I made this movie, went totally off the grid, made this thing, went all my instincts on it, went everything about it on paper. Any algorithm of success would tell you this is not going to work. And yet everything in me said it's going to work. And I make it. And then I panic a little bit and I say, I need to sell this because I put a mortgage on the house and all this stuff. So I show it to everyone in the industry, basically the buyer versions of the industry, six weeks after I shoot it. So six weeks, nothing. I just slapped it together and show it to everybody because I just want them to give me the money and I'm safe and I'm not going to be some e true Hollywood story of what happened and now... And they all passed. Everybody passes. And one company said, I'd love to see it when it's done, but they didn't buy it. But everybody else passes. So I fly home. I'm like, Oh, my God.

[01:08:34.040] - Speaker 2
Do you think they pass because they don't like it, or is there more to the story?

[01:08:39.020] - Speaker 1
It's so different. There's no precedent for it. They keep trying to use- They have no context for this movie. No context, yes. No context at all.

[01:08:47.030] - Speaker 2
Because it's not another one that was successful so they could point to, Well, it's just like that thing that worked.

[01:08:52.210] - Speaker 1
Impossible, right? And they have the context of what they believe is they've lost faith in me in the system, in their opinion, right? So that's all context-related, and it wasn't quite finished. So it's like a 65% version of what it will ultimately be. So you either see the 65% or you go, No, it's really only 30% in your head. You're using all that context to crush it. I come home and my daughter at that time, the youngest daughter and I, used to have this thing when me and her would do puzzles together. That's what we did. We go in the dining room and take a thousand-piece puzzle and dump it on the thing, and we dump it on the thing. And so I got home. Jigsaw puzzle. Jigsaw puzzle. And she was there, and I was completely like a little bit not in my... I was not here. And I'm walking through my house, which I think we're going to sell. And she doesn't know anything. She's just a little kid. And so we sit down and we start to do the thing. And I'm like, Let's do it. And we sit down and we're looking, looking, looking, looking for a piece.

[01:09:58.530] - Speaker 1
And we eventually find it. And we were so excited. It took us 20 minutes to find this one piece. It's the beginning of the thing to make it match. And then I went, Wow. All I have to do is just trust that this painting is this is going to make a picture. And I trust it because it came out of a box. That trusted it. And there is a piece there. Just find the next piece. You don't have to even know how to do this whole thing. Just find the next puzzle piece. And I went, well, that's what I just got to do. Just find the next puzzle piece. So the next morning, I went into the the editing room and we just made one line better and one cut better. And I just spent my days doing one piece at a time, one puzzle piece at a time. And then soon, I forgot that there was a mortgage. I forgot all the rejections and all this stuff. And I was just excited about the next piece, the next piece, the next piece. And I went, Oh, how about if I do this? Oh, you know what?

[01:10:50.040] - Speaker 1
I could go back and shoot this and grab this. That'd be so fun. And do that. And then it just kept on going and I forgot all about it. And then by the time I got months later, when I'd done it hundreds and hundreds When the painting was done, I was like, Let's go back to that person that said they wanted to see it again, and let's show it to them in front of an audience. And we did, and that was universal pictures, and they bought it.

[01:11:13.660] - Speaker 2
What was it like to see it in front of the audience?

[01:11:15.230] - Speaker 1
They went through the roof. They were screaming and yelling and laughing. Exactly what the thesis was, which is that the laughter would turn into screams, and then they would laugh at themselves for screaming. It was so outrageous and provocative. Roller coaster ride, and then they would just forget to be quiet. And they're all just vocal. And it's like a roll up and down. And then the explosion and the laughter and the clapping and all of that stuff. So it was joy. They could feel my play. And then that went and became a huge success with that movie. And then I went on and did many, many, many movies with Universal. And here we are still.

[01:11:55.420] - Speaker 2
Did you do them that way where you would fund them or they would- No, then I did all of them funded.

[01:12:00.880] - Speaker 1
So I funded all of them from then on. Great. Yeah.

[01:12:04.580] - Speaker 2
Did you at one point have a relationship with Blumhouse?

[01:12:07.860] - Speaker 1
What I ended up doing was showing Jason Blum, the movie The Visit, and saying- The finished movie. Pretty much. Yeah. And saying, Could we take one of your slots? Yeah. And so I have that much more. Because even after I showed the movie, there's a resistance, right? Yeah. Because everyone's guessing. So they need things. So his Emperor mature was critical at that moment because they really believed in him. So that combination was like, All right, we'll give you that slot. And then together we went and took that slot. And then it was great.

[01:12:40.340] - Speaker 2
So have you made more with him?

[01:12:42.380] - Speaker 1
We did another one after that together. Yeah, and hopefully we'll make more. Great. Yeah.

[01:12:48.090] - Speaker 2
What's the most interesting part of the process for you of filmmaking?

[01:12:56.150] - Speaker 1
The most painful is the preview screenings when you're showing it to audiences. It's the most painful because what you're making and what they're seeing are not exact. It's a process of getting it that the thing I'm making and the thing they're seeing is this one and the same. Because it's a juxtapositional art form. If I cut from you to... It's the Eisenstein theory of cinema. If I cut from you looking at the bowl, they're interpreting that you're hungry. But I didn't, maybe, didn't mean that. These unintentional connections, so what they're watching versus what I intended, we have to get that in sync is a process of this feels like your soul a little bit is getting torn, but it's a beautiful thing to become one.

[01:13:42.540] - Speaker 2
How do you think being a father informed who you are?

[01:13:46.560] - Speaker 1
Oh, it's everything. I think I was a father even before I became a father. It's just in me. I love kids, and kids really, I think, are drawn to me. So we'll be somewhere, and a little kid will come up to me and in a grocery store. They come and I'll hug them. They're our gurus. They're the ones that are teaching us. We're teaching them about this stupid world that we're in, but they're really teaching us much more important things.

[01:14:16.100] - Speaker 2
Have you ever had a mystical experience?

[01:14:23.050] - Speaker 1
I mean, everything we've been talking about, my whole life, the whole thing, man, the whole thing I mean, you stare at posters of people, and then they become your friends and partners when you're older. It's just incredible.

[01:14:42.140] - Speaker 2
How would you say success has changed you?

[01:14:46.540] - Speaker 1
Well, in a bad way, it has increased my anxieties or the bad versions of my ambition. There's good ambition, and then we need growth, but maybe it's tweaking greed or insecurities of winning in some way.

[01:15:08.670] - Speaker 2
Are you competitive?

[01:15:10.150] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But it should be aimed at yourself.

[01:15:14.790] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the marketing part of the film. Do you get involved at all in the poster, in the trailer, in all of the things surrounding the film?

[01:15:25.900] - Speaker 1
I talk to young filmmakers about this question, and I say, in 2024. And it wasn't that way, like when they put out five easy pieces or something back in the day, they took a New York Times ad and a Los Angeles Times ad, and that was it. And then everything else was, It's in playing at your local theater for one year, and you eventually will tell me to go see it. That's how it was, advertising was. But now it's as costly or costlier than the movie, and they have to sell something. And so what ends up happening is that the marketing department has started telling the story before we did. So the story has begun. So the storytelling is started already. So you have to be a part of it, in my opinion, because if you're passive, then they could tell a different story than the one that you're making, and then you have a problem. So I'm very clear, like when I'm making something, okay, this is going to be... They're going to tell this part of the story before they come into the movie theater, and then we're going to withhold this part of the story.

[01:16:28.620] - Speaker 1
And I have to make sure that I enough for them to tell this part of the story because they spend a lot of money to get it in every theater in the world, the global release. Now, when you're doing platform or any film, that's not necessarily the case. You can get closer to the five easy pieces thing, but not exactly.

[01:16:45.670] - Speaker 2
Do you make movies to be seen in the theater?

[01:16:48.860] - Speaker 1
That's it. Only. Yeah.

[01:16:51.640] - Speaker 2
How is the experience different seeing one of your movies in a theater with a group of people versus watching it at home on a streaming service?

[01:17:01.870] - Speaker 1
There's so many differences of that. But the most important one, the primary one, let's put aside the gratuitous things that at home you're watching it while you're getting changed or doing your laundry or putting on your makeup and you're half watching it. Put aside that, which is real and sad, but let's pretend you are watching it in an ideal form. In your couch, you don't talk, you don't talk your entire time, and you're watching it. When you're watching something by yourself, you are bringing only your worldview to the table, only your perspective of the world. You will see only those things that that reinforces, and you'll be blind to the other things. Let's say, for example, you're a 50-year-old dude watching twilight. You're going to go, Wait a minute. Come, come. Now, if you're in a movie theater and it's full of all ages and you have everyone there, and there's a group of teenage girls down in the front of the that are laughing and gasping. The thing, you cannot help but feel what they're feeling. You're connected like a quilt. So you become a larger version of yourself, something where we're all tied together, and I think a better version of ourselves.

[01:18:16.770] - Speaker 1
She's reminding me that that's actually funny, that scene. It wasn't something to make fun of. That was something that was funny. It was intended. Oh, that has wit for... When you're commenting on what it's like to be a 15-year-old girl or 16-year-old girl, and then your gravitas that you're bringing at age 50, she's feeling that in the silence, in the way you're holding that look from the father or whatever it is. You're each teaching each other to see through each other's eyes in this tiny, important way. And that's beautiful. We expand. We get to be beyond our particular worldview. It's such a beautiful art form, the collective experience together of a story.

[01:18:56.810] - Speaker 2
Can you imagine ever making a black and white film?

[01:18:59.740] - Speaker 1
Sure. Sure. Definitely. Minimalism is lovely. And to some extent, I could argue that it's the most powerful way to do it because it really is in the language of incomplete, and you're filling in everything.

[01:19:13.920] - Speaker 2
I love the idea of the language of the incomplete. I think it's a beautiful thing to think about.

[01:19:19.700] - Speaker 1
Because when you try to complete it, you're obviously going to fail. It's much more complicated and beautiful than the way I was going to define, even if it's a fictional a creature or whatever it is. That's why because the shark wasn't working in Jaws, you got to do it in an incomplete way, and thus it became much bigger and scary.

[01:19:39.430] - Speaker 2
More poetic. The beauty of the incomplete is the audience gets to complete it themselves, and the way we each completed is different.

[01:19:48.210] - Speaker 1
It's bespoke for each of us.

[01:19:49.430] - Speaker 2
It's true for each of us. If you could remake the entire movie system, how would it work differently if you were in charge of the whole system?

[01:20:07.490] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's a tough one, man, because as I said, it's so much about giving you such a heavy frame that you already know the meal already before you've eaten it. If you're eating a cheeseburger and you don't really rate the cheeseburger, unless it's really extraordinary, and then you go, But as long as you got a cheeseburger, you're like, That was good. But if I said, Was it really good? Was the bread great? Was the cheese good? You'll be like, Well, it was okay. You'll be like, Well, actually, it wasn't. You don't even think like that. I'm sure you've heard that experiment they did with, they said, There's wine. It's a very expensive bottle of wine. How did you like it? And you drink it and it tastes amazing. And then how's this one? This one's cheap. And they drink it. It's okay. Then they're measuring the brain. Actually, the receptors of taste are actually firing more with the expensive of one because you've been framed that way. In your experience of it, it did taste better. It really did.

[01:21:06.500] - Speaker 2
The placebo.

[01:21:07.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's really happening because you're experiencing in your head. When we're framing so strongly for them that you're basically watching the movie or experiencing it before you've seen the movie, that's a different system than the one I'm trying to do, which is just trust me. Come to the movie theater. When I understand the struggle of it, I I get it, but I wish the system was geared the opposite way, which is if you say, Hey, Rick, where do you want to go eat? I did that. I texted you and I said, Where should I go eat? You gave me your answers of things, and some of them are, It's just great. Go. You didn't tell me it was Italian food? That's what I wish it was, the way you did it with me. You just said, Food's great. That was it. You didn't even tell me what food. No. I love that. I wish we were oriented to that. I don't have to say Chinese food. I don't have to say burger. I don't have to say pizza. You come and I can give you different things in a different capacity. I can give you something sweet to start.

[01:22:10.230] - Speaker 1
So you don't go, Why am I? This is crazy. And that you're ready for the experience and then you're really present. And that's the way it really was before marketing became the primary driver of cinema.

[01:22:25.370] - Speaker 2
Are there any other directors who, when you see their name before the title of movie, you have a real sense of what you're going to see besides you?

[01:22:34.990] - Speaker 1
I mean, sure. There's Quentin for sure, right?

[01:22:37.510] - Speaker 2
We all know- Wes Anderson.

[01:22:38.990] - Speaker 1
Wes. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, before, that was a lot of them, but the color, you're going to hear such a strong accent. It's beautiful. You're coming for the accent.

[01:22:51.760] - Speaker 2
Can you imagine making a movie that was outside of your genre?

[01:22:59.350] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but I do feel like I have enough room in my genre because it's a mashup of genres to begin with. It already began with a mashup of drama and scary movie. We already just started there. It was a mashup to begin with.

[01:23:13.480] - Speaker 2
How important is Scary?

[01:23:17.470] - Speaker 1
For me, I would like more to define myself in the way I do see myself as more of a thriller filmmaker, which is basically a more muscular mystery, that that's where I am. Then everything else is ornementation on that. But if you go to, if I go somewhere and they're like, someone goes, Oh, I'm a big fan, and they're with their wife or whatever, and their wife says, Oh, I don't watch scary movies. And I always go, Is that what I do? And I go, Huh? Because I know this lady would love almost every single one of them. But she has, I'm in a part of the store that's scary Movies, and that's that. So I a little bit fight that a bit because it's one move or in the whole dance, but it's not all of it.

[01:24:04.220] - Speaker 2
We think of Hitchcock movies as thrillers, but we never think of them as metaphysical. So yours tend to have this.

[01:24:13.040] - Speaker 1
They do have that.

[01:24:13.900] - Speaker 2
Otherworldly equality.

[01:24:16.810] - Speaker 1
This conversation we have is an outcropping of the same things that are in the movie. You're right. There's that. I don't even say that when I was saying, What is it that that you do, but it is critical for me to make those. I would love that lady to not say, I don't like scary movies, as opposed to, you make me feel things in a way of existential thoughts because I can feel you struggling with them and you make characters that struggle with that, and I struggle with that. That lady would love that. But it's because she thinks it's in the corner of the store where people chopped up.

[01:25:00.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's not saw.

[01:25:01.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. That's so funny.

[01:25:04.170] - Speaker 2
How do you think you're most misunderstood?

[01:25:09.420] - Speaker 1
I think we touched on it a bit, the whole scary thing, because I think the most salient flavor is the one that they call it. The subtler flavors are unimportant. The drama, the mystery, the philosophical. Those quieter colors get dismissed a bit and then go, Yeah, man, give me some more Tabasco sauce. I love it. Sometimes it makes me not want to do the Tabasco sauce.

[01:25:38.140] - Speaker 2
It's interesting, the idea of turning up the psychological drama and turning down the Tabasco sauce. I'd want to see one of those.

[01:25:45.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but will the audience, because they were framed for the cheeseburger, get pissed?

[01:25:52.940] - Speaker 2
But do you feel an obligation in that way that they have to hit certain notes?

[01:25:58.130] - Speaker 1
Well, now you're getting to another part of it, which is I do feel a responsibility. There's a covenant to take that money. When they see my name, there's a relationship, a pre-existing relationship, a date that we've been on together, and they expect a similar date. That doesn't need to be confining but beautiful. And so how can you do 80% that and then 20% something new or 70 and 30 or something like that without it being a complete like, Hey, I didn't get the cheeseburger.

[01:26:33.650] - Speaker 2
Who are your favorite filmmakers and what is it about each of them that put them on the list?

[01:26:40.450] - Speaker 1
Oh, my gosh. I mean, it's endless, honestly. It really just is endless. But just I'll take a few. But Kurosara, because again, because of his formality, I just understand why he did everything he does. And the not moving the camera and the moving the camera and his brilliance blocking and his trafficking in deep pathos amongst the plot. And his characters are tortured, and I find them profound. His precision of thought What's your favorite Cursal film? Jeez, this again.

[01:27:18.010] - Speaker 2
It's so good.

[01:27:19.840] - Speaker 1
There's so many. I have posters up of Rochamont in my office and high and low in my office. So both of those in my office, so they're obviously in the pantheon, those two. A Kuru was also one that popped into my head. Incredible. Yeah.

[01:27:37.810] - Speaker 2
How did you learn your craft?

[01:27:42.230] - Speaker 1
Imitation, and then the failure of imitation and why that leaves you empty, and what is that? Then in that space, you start to hear yourself.

[01:27:57.310] - Speaker 2
What's the fox catcher story?

[01:27:59.980] - Speaker 1
I think you're referencing The Village, my movie The Village. Is that what it is? Well, no, but you're referencing the property near our house called Foxcatcher. Dupont. Yes. I would pass it every day. This property was Their family's property was in there, all these acres. They had their own hospital and insane asylum. Inside the gates. Yes. There's a famous story of someone getting murdered in there and all this stuff. It was just full of wonder for me as I was passing this rusted fence covered in ivy. Now it's a development. It's gone. There's all these mansions there and all of that stuff. But back in those days, it was we really conjure imagination in me. I think the Village, the movie The Village, came from that fence.

[01:28:50.890] - Speaker 2
Just driving by. Have you worked much with CGI?

[01:28:56.740] - Speaker 1
Not compared to most. If I can do it in camera, we try to do an in-camera. It's just so hard, right, to, again, in that idea of incompleteness, it's so hard to complete something. I found that it's best when you add obscurity to the CGI. If you have a dinosaur or whatever, you should have it raining, and it should be at night, and there should be other things to create the incompleteness again.

[01:29:25.040] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your spiritual life.

[01:29:28.740] - Speaker 1
I would say right now, I'm teetering on a place of wanting to change what it is that I think I am moment to moment, that I'm a group of thoughts that I call myself that most of those, like all of us, like most of us, has been passively chosen. I've had the wonderful ability to learn how to not do that when I'm making, when I'm creating. It's been a respite from this burden of the passive thoughts that have become who I am. By that means, this is what you think when you're stuck in traffic. This is what you think when you find out someone stole money from you. This is what you think when someone beautiful stands in front of you. Those thoughts. You can choose to think new thoughts. You can. You have to be aware because autopilot happens instantaneously. I'm trying now. I've been thinking for the last, I would say, six weeks now, and I feel it changing. The normal version of me may not get everything here that we're doing right now. I would say all these time, I've always been okay being honest with what I'm asked, but to be here and feel this fabric here and see you and take this with me forever is the hope and convey something of reassurance to you of another person on the planet that is grateful and happy.

[01:31:15.540] - Speaker 1
Hopefully, there's something that comes across. I'm probably not succeeding, but I want that to be the case from here when you're going, What is it you want now? I want with all the scars and all the mistakes and everything, I want to go, those were all beautiful lessons to be someone better. And by better, I just mean happier. I'm trying to concentrate on my thoughts. And when you do that, everything seems wondrous.

[01:31:46.410] - Speaker 2
What do you think happened six or so weeks ago that started this? How did you get on that?

[01:31:51.230] - Speaker 1
It's probably you hear the right thing. It was from a podcast, ironically enough. You have to hear the right thing at the right time, and it goes click. Then you go down, not go down, you go up a rabbit hole. Yeah.

[01:32:05.830] - Speaker 2
Do you remember what it was that you heard?

[01:32:07.930] - Speaker 1
I'm sorry. I'm forgetting the name whose podcast was on, but it was this Dr. Joe Dispenza was talking about thoughts. Yeah. And so I had never heard him before. And then it just went click, the idea when he said, Today, we will have 90% the identical thoughts that we had yesterday. And I went, Oh, my God. We're all in the matrix. We're in our own matrix. We are. And I was like, Well, I don't want to have the same thoughts. And then the thought, I do believe that I've always felt like wherever you are, whatever your vibration is, you're going to bring that because I don't think the universe That energy or it was science. The quantum physics of it all says good or bad. I think, so if I'm not feeling great, there's a lot more not feeling great than it come my way. If I feel people will betray me, oh, my gosh, there's so many more people coming to betray me. And so it's like, if we can resonate in a place of balance, that will come back as well.

[01:33:09.400] - Speaker 2
How much time do you spend in nature?

[01:33:12.300] - Speaker 1
Better. We live on a beautiful property. That and the reason that I picked that property because it is one of those old estates that doesn't exist anymore. And thinking of spending the rest of my life there and having not only did we raise our kids there, but soon, hopefully grandkids that a walking with them. And maybe, maybe if I'm lucky, like my dad, see my great grandkids on that property. Amazing. It would be amazing. Just absolutely amazing. It's wondrous, the trees that we planted, and they're all grown. It's just absolutely amazing. I want to spend more and more time. Every year, I spend more time outside.

[01:33:55.400] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your movie watching habits.

[01:33:58.990] - Speaker 1
It's sacred. Nothing's casual at the house, which obviously really is a bummer for my wife and kids. It's just too meaningful, the images that come into my head. I'll force myself to sit with them to just be a part of their lives for a few minutes, but it's literally like getting burned. So when I'm taking it in, it can be anything. It can be a rom-com. It just has to be exquisite. And in that, what it is, it has to be beautiful in and of itself, its version of what it is. When you see my movie collection, that's not snobbery. You have the Bergmans and all that stuff, but you do have everything because when I was the chair of the Berlin Film Festival, I said to the jurors, they said, What are the criteria? How do we do this? And I said, We're not judging genre. So whoever achieved what they set out to do at the highest level, whoever did it the best, that's who wins.
