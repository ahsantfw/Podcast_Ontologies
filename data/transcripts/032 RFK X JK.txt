[00:00:06.700] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. What are the major pollutants that get dumped into water and who dumps it?

[00:00:28.470] - Speaker 2
Well, that depends where you are. I spend time with farmers in the Midwest who can't drink their water from their wells anymore because agricultural chemicals have contaminated the groundwater. They're part of the dispossessed in this country, this entire generation that's being mass-poisoned and then mass-propagandized. That's The drinking water, I would say the biggest contaminant is agriculture run-offs in most part of the country, but it depends where you are. It's really a community like New York City's drinking water comes from three upstate reservoir systems, and two of them are fantastic. And then one of them, the smallest one, the Croden system, has 102 sewer treatment plants discharging into it. And on a dry year, 2% of the water that comes out of your tap has been through a sewer plant. There's no filtration. And that water now contains all kinds of pharmaceuticals. So they're finding these subtherapeutic levels of hormones, of Earth control pills, of all kinds of hormones, and all kinds of hormones and all kinds of antidepressants and psychoactive drugs, Prozac, et cetera, in public water supplies all over the country. The water supply, almost no water supply, has That's the carbon filtration system that you would need to filter that out.

[00:02:04.350] - Speaker 2
In terms of non-drinking water, probably the most serious pollutants are actually nutrients or nitrogen, phosphates, potassium, which cause algae blooms, which then rob the water of its oxygen. They biologically impoverish these aquatic ecosystems. Because during certain times of the year, there'll be zero dissolved oxygen, and the water supply is gone. And then if we're looking at pollutants of concern, probably one of the biggest concerns that we should have is Mercury as coming from coal-burning power plants. It also comes from cement kilns, from some mining activities that is now every freshwater fish in the United States now has dangerous levels of mercury in its flood. We're living like in a science fiction nightmare today, where my children and the children of every other American, are now no longer engaged in the seminal primal activity of American youth, which is to go fishing in their local fishing hole and then come home and safely eat the fish. To me, as a kid, that would have been unimaginable that somebody would be allowed to pollute every fish in our country, but it's become normalized now.

[00:03:19.650] - Speaker 3
Is this a global problem or is this a US problem?

[00:03:21.770] - Speaker 2
No, it's global. I mean, the worst offender is China.

[00:03:26.160] - Speaker 1
Just so you know, the local, I should say, the global fish market has changed in your lifetime and mine. Now there's aquaculture where they actually have to now farm the fish because we've polluted the water so badly that we have to wall it off. I mean, that's our legacy.

[00:03:44.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Farm-fed fish, the stuff they're feeding them is heavily contaminated with...

[00:03:50.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you clean the water up and then you ruin it with bad food.

[00:03:53.510] - Speaker 2
I would rather eat a wild caught salmon than a farm-fed salmon. In terms of their toxic loes, it's better to eat a wild fish. But still the wild fish have really dangerous levels of mercury in them and other contaminants as well. It's depressing the world that we're giving to our kids.

[00:04:14.370] - Speaker 3
I just read something about a program where millions of genetically modified mosquitoes are being released in different places of the world.

[00:04:20.360] - Speaker 2
That's insane. I don't even know how to talk about it. I would say it's insane.

[00:04:25.910] - Speaker 1
But it goes exactly to what you just said about-How could that go wrong? Yeah, exactly.

[00:04:30.020] - Speaker 2
No, how can it go right? It's Bill Gates funding all those bizarre experiments. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but they did it in South Florida, and for the first time in decades, they had malaria outbreaks in South Florida. I didn't know that.

[00:04:47.330] - Speaker 3
I didn't know that.

[00:04:48.260] - Speaker 2
I don't know if they're connected or they're coincidental.

[00:04:50.470] - Speaker 3
We can't know, but it's interesting correlation. Yeah.

[00:04:53.800] - Speaker 1
Anytime you mess with a decentralized network, you create a centralized problem.

[00:04:59.290] - Speaker 3
How is Is there something like releasing millions of mosquitoes legal to do?

[00:05:05.010] - Speaker 2
It should be illegal. I mean, it should be, but you can get a permit. If you do the environmental impact statement, you do all of the studies that you're supposed to do, then there's a bureaucrat who can say, Yeah, I'd do this, but it just doesn't make any sense. Nobody with any knowledge of ecology would let that happen. I understand Some of the experiments are more benign and maybe conceptually, okay, that might be okay. For example, you release male mosquitoes that are sterile and don't know they're sterile. The male mosquitoes don't bite people. It's only the females. They need a blood meal in order to create their eggs. If you release tens of millions of male mosquitoes, they are going to breed with the females and the eggs will be infertil. So that was a way to dampen production. That is the theory. Of course, that can go wrong in a million ways. The really bad things are the ones that are just bad conceptually, which is you create a vaccine and you give it to the mosquito, and the mosquitoes then go out and vaccinate the population. So If you get bit by a mosquito, you're getting a protein antigen from a virus.

[00:06:36.490] - Speaker 3
How do you control the dosage?

[00:06:38.200] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't know. What happens if you get 100 mosquito bites? I think they're not really interested in controlling their dosage. They're interested in controlling vaccine hesitancy, and that's the complete solution to that because you're getting bit by a mosquito and you can't say no.

[00:06:56.570] - Speaker 3
There was another plan to to deal with global warming by blocking out the sun. Have you heard that one?

[00:07:04.320] - Speaker 2
I'm against all geo-engineering projects, including all the carbon capture projects. They're all. I can't say they're all flim-flam flams because I don't know them all, but all the ones that I see and the ones that we're spending tens of billions of dollars on are wasteful flim-flams. We should spend that money, would be much better spent helping farmers It's transition to regenerative agriculture.

[00:07:33.240] - Speaker 3
Most of the problems we've talked about come back to a profit motive. Someone has a profit incentive, and that's what makes them do bad things. I've heard people talk about it as that's just the nature of capitalism. What is your feeling about that?

[00:07:48.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the problem is not capitalism. Let me put it this way. It's not free market capitalism. It's corporate crony capitalism. I Actually, I've always said that the best thing for the environment would be true free market capitalism. Because a true free market would promote efficiency. Efficiency means the elimination of waste and pollution is waste. In a true free In a true free market, we would be forced to properly value our natural resources, and it's the undervaluation of those resources that caused us to use them wastefully. In a true free market, you can't make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and without enriching your community. But what polluters do is they make themselves rich by making everybody else poor.

[00:08:38.400] - Speaker 3
How would that system work?

[00:08:39.690] - Speaker 2
How could you make that system work? It would work because you force every actor in the marketplace to internalize all their costs. When General Electric Company wants to produce a capacitor or a transformer, it's cheaper for it to come its PCBs into the Hudson the river, the excess PCBs, right? It's cheaper than properly collecting them and reusing them. It's illegal for them to do it, but they're able to use the political cloud to escape the licensing strictures, and therefore to escape the discipline of the free market. In a true free market, you bring all... You internalize all your costs. So every cost that it takes to get your product to market, you have to pay. But what polluters do is they figure out ways to externalize their costs, not to dump their stuff. And that includes... The cost includes cleaning up after yourself, which was a lesson we were all supposed to learn in kindergarten. All pollution is a diversity, where polluters figure out a way to externalize their cause and get the public to shoulder the burden of bringing their product to market. And by doing that, they can lower their price artificially and send the wrong signal else in the market.

[00:10:01.590] - Speaker 2
It distorts the whole marketplace. None of us gets the advantages of the efficiency and the prosperity and the democracy that free market capitalism otherwise promises our country. You show me a polluter, I'll show you a subsidy. I'll show you a fat cat using political the cloud to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay its production costs. That's what all pollution is. We have laws that make it illegal to do that, but the agencies are there at this point to abet the polluter in escaping those laws.

[00:10:33.290] - Speaker 3
The problem is corruption.

[00:10:34.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the problem is corruption rather than capitalism. I love capitalism. I think it liberates the human spirit, and it It's the corruption of capitalism that caused all the problems.

[00:10:50.150] - Speaker 3
What changes have you made personally in your life that had the biggest impact on you?

[00:10:54.970] - Speaker 2
To me, well, getting sober had the biggest impact on me.

[00:10:57.850] - Speaker 3
How long was that?

[00:10:59.170] - Speaker 2
In 1983, so 40 years ago. Wow.

[00:11:03.880] - Speaker 3
Amazing.

[00:11:05.640] - Speaker 2
That caused me to do a complete, let's say, spiritual realignment and recovery is part of my day-to-day life. I go to a meeting every day, and I've integrated that, the whole meditation and trying to maintain that spiritual connection, which is, I would say, the primary governing feature my life, how do you stay in conscious contact with God? How do you work with one foot in the spiritual world and one in the visible world? That's our challenge. The challenge, how do you stay in that posture of subduing self-will and surrendering self-will. Somebody said to me yesterday that we're not humans having a spiritual experience. We're spirits a human experience. That, to me, is a good way of looking at it because it means everything is a test of your capacity to maintain that posture of surrender and stay in that spiritual realm, living that life, integrity, and all the things that requires.

[00:12:24.060] - Speaker 3
What is something that you believed when you were younger that you don't believe anymore?

[00:12:28.490] - Speaker 2
There's institutions that I've lost faith in that I was very idealistic about, I would say, naive about when I was younger. Then I think I'm a lot less likely now to break, particularly conflicts that you see around the built into binary formulations.

[00:12:47.470] - Speaker 3
Good guy, bad guy. It's more complicated.

[00:12:50.330] - Speaker 2
To always understand that most human beings are good people and that they have a different set of assumptions, but they're all we want the same thing. I mean, even Republicans and Democrats these days, I would say that I grew up with a binary idea and that those categories are now breaking down so radically right now. It's very interesting.

[00:13:20.850] - Speaker 3
How is the experience of running for office different than you imagined it would be?

[00:13:24.830] - Speaker 2
It's much funner. Really? Yeah. Why do you think? The biggest The thing for me is that my wife is enjoying it, and she was really frightened of it. There's just really good energy on the trail. We're getting huge crowds. We have 250,000 volunteers years, which is more than anybody else. I like it. I enjoy doing it. I've been on a lot of campaigns in my life, and they were always difficult, and this is much easier.

[00:13:58.820] - Speaker 3
Have you been surprised by some of the people who are supporting you and by some of the people who are not supporting you?

[00:14:05.570] - Speaker 2
I'm not going to say I'm surprised because I've been living with this since 2005, losing friendships, I lost a lot I've had business relationships, I lost political relationships that I developed over my whole lifetime because of my position on these public health issues. So I'm not surprised by it. Some people have surprised me. There's three particular friends of mine who disappointed me, let's say. I mean, I tend to just accept everything as how it's supposed to be, so I don't. I don't complain about anything. But they were relationships that were very important to me and that people literally walked away from it, said, I'm walking away from this relationship. But otherwise, I have four of my family members who who have spoken out publicly against me. That, I suppose, was surprising. But I also understand where they're coming from. And I understand everybody is filled with fear and confusion about this issue. So I let that go and just say, I hope the best for everybody, and I love people who don't agree with me.

[00:15:30.560] - Speaker 3
Tell me about natural resources that get privatized. How does that happen?

[00:15:35.440] - Speaker 2
One of the essential doctrines in democracy was for, I think, 2,800 years, the Code of Justinian. It was one of the first efforts it said constitutional governance. The Code of Justinian was a constitution in ancient Rome that stated something that everybody innately understood, this concept that those things that cannot be easily reduced to private property ownership, but by their nature, are the assets of community, can never be privatized. They included air, water, wildlife, fisheries, public lands, the wandering animals. There were some forests that were something equivalent to national forests in ancient Rome. Those were for the public. And also the aquifers of course, which they also recognize in ancient Rome. And what they could have just said is that everybody owns those assets. Everybody gets to use them. Nobody gets to use them in a way that will diminish or ensure their use and impact by others. You can take your share, but you can't take all of it. In ancient Rome, no matter whether you're rich or poor, humble or noble, white or black, which there was Africans who are citizens of Roma and Europeans. If you had that gift of citizenship, then you had an absolute right to cross a beach, throw in a net, take out your share of the fish, The Emperor himself couldn't stop you.

[00:17:18.220] - Speaker 2
That was a central right. But what happens whenever democracy begins to decline, you see an elite entity entities, powerful entities that come in and begin privatizing what is called the Commons or the public trust assets, which are these assets. When Rome collapsed in 375 AD, I think the burning of the library of Alexander, then we had 800 years of darkness. You had feudal kings and local lords and warrior knights who began privatizing the public trust. For example, in England, King John said that the deer, the game animals, and the rabbits, that once belonged to all the people, and now were the possession of the barons and lords who own that property. That's what got him in trouble with Robin hood, because the deer and the rabbits were the social safety net at that time. They didn't have social security or unemployment. But if your crop didn't come in, you could go feed your family by killing a deer. Now that became illegal. He also privatized transport on the Thames and the other rivers of England. He erected navigational tolls and gave the rights to collect holes to powerful allies. And he also gave the fisheries.

[00:18:51.560] - Speaker 2
So the fish in the Thames and the other, you now had to pay somebody a license to harvest those. And these were all social safety nets that belong to the public. And those reforms caused the public to rise up, and they confronted King John at the Battle of Running Mead, and they forced him to sign the Magna Carta, which is called, the full name of it is the Magna Carta and the Charter of the forest. It's the Bethlehem of all of our Bill of Rights in this country. But it also provides for free and total public access to rivers, to waters, and to public trust assets. Those rights descend into the people of this country when we had the revolution in our country. In fact, up until 1847, it was the law in every jurisdiction in the United States that if you owned a factory and smoke from your factory got into my house as little as one day a year, I had an absolute right to close down your factory because you were traspassing on my property and on the public Property. Those laws, in order to make way for the Industrial Revolution, those laws were gradually, were quickly eroded at that point by government officials, by judges, and by others, and it became much easier to trample on.

[00:20:18.250] - Speaker 2
That public trust doctrine was eroded and corroded. But after Earthing, and then we got to a point where the pendulum swung so far the other way. By 1969, which was a key year, that year, the Cuyahoga River burned with flames that were so high.

[00:20:40.950] - Speaker 3
Explain how a river burns.

[00:20:42.090] - Speaker 2
It's hard to understand. It has chemicals and gas on the surface.

[00:20:44.450] - Speaker 1
Things in it that shouldn't be in it, my friend.

[00:20:45.890] - Speaker 2
It was a Clean Air Act in 1600 in England. That was a capital offense. They made it a crime to burn coal in London stuff. People are executed for it. It's always been a crime to pollute water. But those laws were eroded. And then the Cuyoahoga River burns with flames are eight stories high. They can't put it out. There's a coating of chemicals, hydrocarbons all over the water. That same Year, like Erie was declared dead, zero dissolved oxygen, all the fish life disappeared.

[00:21:20.070] - Speaker 3
This is '69, isn't it?

[00:21:21.280] - Speaker 2
'69. The Santa Barbara oil spill happens that year. It closed all the beaches and caused billions of dollars, the economy of Southern California. The Eastern Adam Peregrin folk and the most spectacular predatory bird in America went extinct, was declared extinct that year. And And all of these insults drove 20 million Americans out onto the street in 1970, that's the largest public demonstration in American history. It scared the The political classes to death, both Republican and Democrat. Over the next 10 years, they passed 11 years, 28 environmental laws, the Clean Air, Clean Water Act, and Danger Species Act, The Circular Rikra, Safe Drinking Water Act, the Mining Act, all of these acts that were designed to reestablish those old public trust rights that had been eroded since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. None of them were actually new laws. They were actually just codification of laws that had been since Roman times. It was a restatement. Each one of those laws, we knew when we wrote them that the industries would be able to come in and capture the agencies. We created EPA then, et cetera. Nixon was President. We knew that the industry was going to come capture the agencies and disable the enforcement mechanism Each one of those laws contains a citizen supervision that says if the government fails to enforce this law, any citizen can step into the shoes of the United States attorney and prosecute polluters and for fines, now it's $33,000 a day and get all your attorney's fees back.

[00:23:19.570] - Speaker 2
And that was my bread and butter for the first 30 years of my... I was suing people under that. I brought over 500 lawsuits under those laws, those statutes.

[00:23:29.270] - Speaker 3
How Has it changed since then?

[00:23:31.600] - Speaker 2
Well, I've changed because now I'm doing more plaintiffs' laws. You can never really change behavior with those statuts because the fines were so little. These companies are making billions of dollars by cheating, by polluting. The courts would only give us a million dollars, would be a huge judgment. For me, I moved into doing plaintiffs work in early 2000. I started suing these companies on behalf of people who were injured and getting big settlement. My first case that I actually argued myself was against a DuPont smelter, Zinc smelter, and Spelter, West Virginia. They had poison 10,000 families, and I got one of the biggest judgments from a jury. I think I got $643 million. The judges reduced those, so you don't end up getting all that money. But it was huge. It was huge against a big company, DuPont. It was a very, very big judgment at that time. I was like, Oh, wow, I'm in a different world now, and this actually can change corporate behavior because if I want a suit under the Clean Water Act, I don't even know if the CEO of DuPont would know that I brought that suit because It's such a drop in the bucket.

[00:25:01.390] - Speaker 2
It's a drop in the bucket. It's not even a rounding error. But you get 643 million or $2. 2 billion judgment, and the lawyer on that case as the CEO on speed dial, and the entire board is sitting in a boardroom somewhere waiting for that to come back. They hear that judgment, and somebody says, We got to change. It To me, it was a much more potent weapon, and I started doing a lot more of those plaintiffs' suits. The groups that are doing them, the plaintiff trial lawyer are a group that I was very compatible with because they're all alpha personalities who are committed to poor and powerless people. Their whole lives are about that, and they're super smart. And they're army, and they know how to win wars against these big shots. They're not just fighting for crumbs. It's existential to some of these companies. You read Maya, you read the Fauci book.

[00:26:22.730] - Speaker 1
The Fauci book was spectacular. My life has been taken apart by the pre-Fauci story. Why? Because Plus, I happened to do training in a place where nefarious things were done that set the conditions of existence for what you wrote in the Fauci book. Now, you know about Operation Paper Club, you know about MK Ultra, but you know that it was done on the floors It was a two-lane neurosurgery and neurology. That's across the street from where I did my residency at LSU. They're separate medical schools. But LSU and two-lane neurosurgery, when I went through, we were combined Dine program. I had heard all these stories about some crazy stuff that went on in the neurosurgery department in the '50s and '60s. Of course, I asked questions. I'm a guy from New York, so I'm interested in finding this stuff out. Long story short, I started to begin to hear the stories about a lab that was on magazine street that was tied to the two-lane neurosurgery, two-lane neurology work that was being done. Early in my residency, this will show you how old I am, we used to do basal tip aneurysm surgery. Back then, we didn't have endovascular stuff, so we had to split people's chest open to stop their heart, to clip the aneurysm in their brain.

[00:27:46.120] - Speaker 1
The gentleman who actually was the cardiovascular surgeon who did that was John Oschner. That's the son of Alton Oschner. J. O. Was a Southern... He was a pretty quirky guy, but he was pretty chatty. One of the questions that I had after my first two years at Charity Hospital, what started all this is Oliver Stone filmed JFK. My intern year. I was in the emergency room when they filmed that movie. This is the reason why all this stuff percolated up. I go to Ashtar.

[00:28:23.850] - Speaker 2
One of the villains in that movie was Ferry, who had worked in He had a lab. He had a lab in his own house.

[00:28:33.240] - Speaker 1
Well, Ferry is the most interesting one that ties to your Fauci book. That's the reason I asked you, did your dad ever tell you anything about the death of Ferry? Because one of the things you know about your uncle's death that I always found amazing is that the only place that anybody ever came to trial was in New Orleans because of the Clay Shaw link.

[00:28:57.850] - Speaker 2
Because of Jim Garrison. Right.

[00:28:59.590] - Speaker 1
But But Jim Garrison went after Shaw and not Osner. He knew about Osner. I don't know if you know that. That's part of the reason why I really wanted to discuss this with you, because when Ferry was killed, your dad actually called-You know who Ferry was?

[00:29:19.660] - Speaker 3
Just from the movie.

[00:29:20.990] - Speaker 2
He was a pilot who had trained in the Air National Guard in Louisiana with Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was very young. I think he started training as a pilot when he was 16 years old.

[00:29:33.550] - Speaker 1
On the North shore of Louisiana.

[00:29:35.540] - Speaker 2
And then Ferry became a pilot for the Eastern Airlines. Yeah, but he was a pilot for the CIA doing gun running to Cuba. In Jim Douglas's book, The Unspeakable, he was the pilot who was in Dallas on November 22nd, when my uncle was killed, and was allegedly transporting some of the people who were involved, including some of the people who were involved in my uncle's killing. I did not know that. Yeah. He was also involved with Dr. Ashtal. He had a satellite lab at his own house, and when he was killed or died- That's the funny part.

[00:30:22.420] - Speaker 1
Your dad calls nick Chetta.

[00:30:23.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah, to ask. Yeah, I remember that. My father called the coroner to try to figure out whether it was an accidental death or a natural death or whether it was suicide. A lot of this stuff I'm reaching back for years. He was an interesting guy. He was a very strange-looking man because when he-Alepecia area.

[00:30:46.930] - Speaker 1
He had alepecia.

[00:30:47.570] - Speaker 2
He painted a black thick eyebrows on himself, and he had a very weird, bad, bad toupee. He was part of this of the gay Mafia in New Orleans, which was also part of a Cuban underground that was linked to the Mafia. There were three mob families: Traficante, who was from Tallahassee, Giancana, who was from Chicago, and Carlos Marcello, who was the New Orleans Dallas boss. And he was a Libyan or Algerian in. Correct. My father actually had him deported repeatedly. Once, he had him deported barefoot to the jungle in Guatemala. He was in a jury trial that my father was trying to... The day that my uncle was killed, he was on trial. All those bosses, my father was prosecuting, they had all been involved with the casinos in Havana. When Bill Harvey, who was the head of the Miami station, recruited, they wanted to get somebody to kill Castro. They went to the Mafia. They went through a mobster called Johnny Rizzelli, who who then became the liaison to the three big families. They then all became involved in training with the Cubans, first for the Bay of Pigs, and then later on for...

[00:32:28.360] - Speaker 2
These were the people who involved in President Kennedy's death.

[00:32:31.940] - Speaker 1
Just so you know, Ferry was one of the pilots that was involved in the Bay of Pigs. He was actually shot down. That's the reason why he was anti-Kennedy, because he didn't get the air support The other big part of this story is, how does a guy who's a defrocked priest, fired from Eastern Airlines, wind up working with the best cancer researcher in the world than Mary Stuart? Who was the person that put this together? Well, Jim Garrison had the pieces. The key piece was Clay Shaw was one of the neocons that worked with the CIA who had a direct link. This is the really interesting part of this. When Ferry was killed, his dad calls nick Chetta.

[00:33:19.350] - Speaker 2
Ferry called up and said, You just killed me. Correct. He called up. I think Garrison released his name. He did. He called up Garrison and he said, You just killed me. I'm a dead man. And then the next day, he was dead of natural causes.

[00:33:33.680] - Speaker 3
So wild.

[00:33:34.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, the best book on this, I don't know if you've read it, but it's a book called The Unspeakable by Jim Douglas.

[00:33:41.950] - Speaker 1
I think the two that I brought you today, I think you're in the light.

[00:33:44.980] - Speaker 2
Those are very good. But Douglas is in a different realm. I've read both those books. Is that right? Yeah. And Douglas is in a utterly different realm. Every word is documented. And what he's done The Warren Commission had very, very little data available. Since then, there's been probably a million pages of documents released, and many of the people who are involved in my uncle's death have made confessions, probably 20 of them. None of that was available in '64 during the Warren Commission, and none of it was available in '79 during the House Elect Assassinations Committee investigation, which was much more thorough than the Warren Commission. The House Select Assassinations Committee concluded that it was a conspiracy and that Bob Blakey, who was the Chief Counsel of that Commission, believed that it was a more mob than CIA, but later retracted that, has since retracted that, and now says that he is convinced that there was CIA involvement. But all the other people on this- So 20 people admitted that they were part of it? Yeah. I mean, People like E. Howard Hunt, who was one of the who admitted being on the initial planning stages.

[00:35:10.320] - Speaker 2
He didn't admit involvement in the end. He said, I was there with Bill Harvey and I wasn't... He said he didn't want to get involved because of Bill Harvey, but he said that that plan had evolved into my uncle's assassination. David Morales, who is the chief hitman for the CIA, he did the Operation Phoenix program after my uncle's death. He killed 25,000 people, I believe, in Vietnam. He was later Then he later died under mysterious circumstances.

[00:35:52.130] - Speaker 1
He died- You got to find that's a recurrent theme.

[00:35:54.400] - Speaker 3
It's an unbelievable fact that we're still living in this numb, propagandized environment.

[00:36:01.910] - Speaker 1
It's because it's effective.

[00:36:03.820] - Speaker 2
Also, it was illegal for the CIA to propagandize American people. That was in its charter. It's an act called the Smith Mund Act. It made it illegal. Then they admitted it when it came out in the church. Church Commission, right. They admitted it, and a lot of articles that were very alarmed and critical of it. The CIA They, at that point, promised that they would stop doing that. They remained today, admittedly, the largest funder of journalism worldwide. They pump $10 billion in through USAID to fund newspapers, newspaper journalists, television, et cetera. They own television stations. They own newspapers in all over the developing world and in Europe, and they control them. They're the biggest funder of journalism in the world under USAID. But then in 2016, Obama issued an executive order that appears to overrule the Smith Mund Act and allowed the CIA to once again, propagandize American people. So today, you're seeing all these, and we've done articles that show the elevation of people who are clearly part of the national security state to run major magazines and newspapers, including The Daily Beast, Salon, Slate, Rolling Stone. The guy who now... Rolling Stone was a counterculture magazine.

[00:37:50.870] - Speaker 2
It's now run by a guy called Noah Schlackman. Yon Wendell was pushed out. Noah Schlackman now runs it, and he has deep credentials and background in a national security state. Then you see the reporting and place like National Geographic, Scientific American. A lot of the press that has foreign orientation is run. But you'll see that they were all COVID-alarmists. They were all very pro-vaccine, dismissive of any questioning. They're all pro-war, pro-Ukraine, but any war, they're pros. You can see these propaganda threads that dominate those news organs. We've done a series of articles showing the links between those magazines and the national security apparatus.

[00:38:54.740] - Speaker 1
The propaganda is a huge problem, both in centralized medicine, but also in what you've been doing as an environmental lawyer, but now running for President. I'm going to ask you a question a lot of Bitcoiners want me to ask you. It's pretty clear that you know that war is expensive. What do you think the connection between November 22nd, 1963, and 1971, and Nixon removing the gold standard?

[00:39:25.150] - Speaker 2
My uncle was worried about fiat currency, and fiat currency was invented to fund war. That was its whole purpose. My uncle was worried about it. Just before he died, he tried to reattach our currency to our greenbacks to a base currency. He issued gold certificates, silver certificates. When I was a kid, you could see them, and it was the thrill that you could actually redeem is billed for gold or silver. I think they only lasted a year or something after he died. But then in '71, X and D couples, our paper currency from the gold standard, and That was the beginning, I think. In many ways, it's the beginning of the end. Also, he did it to fund the Vietnam War. Correct.

[00:40:23.560] - Speaker 1
That's why most of the Bitcoiners want to know from you. Since you're now running for President, we have to make decisions. We love that you came out for Bitcoin. People want to know how you learned about Bitcoin. Was it endogenously because of what happened through your family?

[00:40:41.740] - Speaker 2
I have a teenage, 20, 30-year-old So I heard about Bitcoin. But I became interested in it during COVID because I saw what happened in Canada during the trucker strike, where you had truckers from all over Canada. It's very, very diverse. The truckers in Canada are very diverse. There's a lot of Blacks, Asian. It was not... They later deliberately tried to portray it as a right wing revolt, but it wasn't. Truckers were being ordered to comply with all kinds of mandates, including vaccines. And they protested, and they started a parade of trucks from Alberta and BC all the way across the country, and they ended up in Ottawa, in the capital. It was a very peaceful demonstration. They just wanted to meet with Trudeau. And if you look at the videos of the demonstration, it was like Woodstock. They were doing garbage pickups, they were doing cookouts and feeding the poor. It was really this very magnanimous, idealistic movement. And there were efforts to portray it as right wing. And in fact, on two occasions, people went in with Confederate flags, wearing Baclava and military boots, and the truckers chased them out. And yet that was the picture of the Confederate flags that ended up in the newspaper.

[00:42:15.110] - Speaker 2
So So Trudeau declines to meet with them and says they're dangerous at their right wing. And he then does something that I had warned about a few months before I had gone to Milan, and I had read about what was happening with Central Bank Digital Currencies in China, where they had now programmable currencies, which means that if you fall below a certain score on your social credit score, you get punished. So if you didn't have a mask on over your nose during a mandatory mask day, you'd be seen on facial recognition systems, which are everywhere in China. They deduct from your social credit scores, or if you get too close to your girlfriend during a social distancing day, they penalize you. The way they penalize you is that your credit card won't work anymore, except within grocery stores within a certain radius of your It won't let you get on airplanes, it won't let you get on subways or anything. It won't let you buy gasoline for your car, won't let you get on subways or anything else.

[00:43:22.970] - Speaker 3
This exists now, you're saying?

[00:43:24.370] - Speaker 2
It's in China. It's in China. But about a month before Canada, I was in Milan, and I was And they were doing vaccine passports, and they were imposing them. And I said, The second that you allow them to do that is the vaccine passport has all your medical records, but it has other things like it could have your financial records, et cetera. I said, The second that you do that, every right that you have suddenly becomes a privilege that is contingent upon your compliance with a government mandate. And I said, Here's how they're going to enforce it. They're going to give you a social credit score. It sounds paranoid, but I said, That's what they're doing China, so don't let them do it here. Then a month later, in Canada, Trudeau then has all these truckers. None of them have been charged, but they use facial recognition system, and they use surveillance systems to get the license plates on their cars, on their trucks. They know who they are, and they freeze all their bank accounts. It's illegal. It's illegal, isn't it? Yeah. Because these guys have never- Not in Canada.

[00:44:27.710] - Speaker 1
They changed the law because of this happening. Trudeau actually invoked something to allow this to go on. The craziest part is the rest of the people in the legislature allowed it to go on. These guys use Bitcoin to survive this event. That's the point- Not only that, but they collected on PayPal.

[00:44:49.200] - Speaker 2
They collected millions of dollars from a fund from people all over the world. I sent 20 bucks.

[00:44:55.710] - Speaker 1
It's like a go fund me.

[00:44:56.960] - Speaker 2
And PayPal froze it and confiscated it.

[00:45:00.260] - Speaker 3
And obfuscated. Has that ever happened before?

[00:45:01.940] - Speaker 2
No. At that point, I was like, Oh- Understand what centralization, why it's a problem? I immediately saw with a lot of clarity, a transactional freedom is as important as freedom of oppression, because if the government can starve you to death, freedom of speech becomes irrelevant. If they can take your mortgage, if they can put you and your children on the street, if they can put... I had one of these truckers tell me that he couldn't pay his alimony, and the police were coming after him. So because Trudeau had frozen his bank account, he was now in jeopardy of losing his freedom altogether. And at that point, that's when I said, Okay, Bitcoin is a way. Because they were also, if you remember, during COVID, they started to say, Oh, paper currency is spread germ. And the ATMs started disappearing hearing. In a lot of countries, they took away the ATMs. I could see they're trying to shift us to all digital currencies and credit cards.

[00:46:09.980] - Speaker 1
Precondition what you really want. That's the goal. The reason why I'm glad he's talking about this is because in the Bitcoin community, people say, Well, we think Bobby Kennedy just has learned about Bitcoin from David Bailey. I said, I don't think that that's the case. I want to ask him directly not only how this ties to his family, what happened in '63, '71. But the stuff that-Who's David Bailey? David Bailey is a big Bitcoiner. Well, I'm glad that you're saying that, too, because that makes me even more happy, because it sounds like you came to this endogenously and realized that this is in a bridge to freedom. The question I have for you is, do you think that some of the recent current events that have just shown up because of scientists that showed there's a problem with the vaccine, with SV40 in it, with DNA plasmids, when that stuff wasn't supposed to happen? When you consider some of the legalese that was in the emergency authorization realization. I'm concerned that the things that happened in that lab with David Ferry, the exact same things that they did before we knew about how molecular biology worked.

[00:47:27.300] - Speaker 1
They used a Linnack to create small little pieces of DNA, an SV40, to concentrate something. It's beyond me how now we know, because of Kevin McKiernan and because of Philip Buckholz, two guys who probably you would have fought against in the last 10 or 15 years, now I've shown beyond a shadow of doubt that the same thing that Mary Stuart and Sarah Stuart wrote in the treaties that was found the day David Ferry died, that's the smoking gun that Garrison had.

[00:48:01.560] - Speaker 2
I don't know. That book is very compelling, but I don't know. Do you know the story of SV40? No. Sv40 was in the early poliovaccines, they were growing the poliovirus on a substrat of amasticated monkey kidneys.

[00:48:24.750] - Speaker 1
African green monkeys.

[00:48:25.900] - Speaker 2
Yeah, they were using African green monkeys. Also, there's other forms of the vaccine. Stanley Kupinski was using Bonobo chimpanzees, which there's a whole book about that. That's where the HIV virus made the leap into human beings. But anyway, what they didn't know at that time, because you couldn't see viruses. You can't find them. They're too small. There was no microscopes at that time.

[00:48:56.520] - Speaker 1
Also, remember, DNA was discovered in '53. This is going on in '50, '51, '52. So the state of molecular biology at that time was what I would call rudimentary. Right.

[00:49:08.290] - Speaker 2
So what they didn't realize, these monkeys had hundreds and hundreds of viruses that nobody knew what would happen if they jumped into human beings. There was a very famous scientist who was the most award-winning scientist at that time in NIH. His name was Bernese Bernice Eddie. I think she actually knew Mary Stewart.

[00:49:34.780] - Speaker 1
No, not only did she know her. You're making me very happy, Bobby, because guess what? The fact that you know Bernice, because I'm going to tell you, the guy Kevin McKiernan I just told you about, I tweeted at him yesterday. I said, When I talk to Bobby tomorrow, I'm going to make you as famous as Bernice Eddie because her career was destroyed for telling the truth. She's the one, and he'll know this story better. I don't mean to interrupt you, I get excited when you get right there. Marcus Hilleman, who was a leading researcher for Merck, gets all the credit- He invented the MMR vaccine. He gets all the credit, though, for this story that Bobby is laying out.

[00:50:15.610] - Speaker 2
Just to tell you briefly what it is, she discovered that there's all these viruses in it.

[00:50:23.010] - Speaker 1
1955. Right.

[00:50:24.040] - Speaker 2
One of the virus, she called them Simeon viruses, so SV. That's what it stands for. The 40th one she discovered was a virus that was extraordinarily oncogenic, and it was carcinogenic.

[00:50:40.880] - Speaker 1
It didn't cause cancer in the African green monkeys, but today, As of 2023, anytime SV40 is in another vector, it causes cancer. Yeah.

[00:50:51.870] - Speaker 2
In fact, they use it in laboratories that are studying tumors. They use it to induce tumor growth. You give it to a guinea pig and it will sprout tumors like a mushroom field. It's the most carcinogenic stuff that they know of. At least when I was looking at it, it was the most carcinogenic. It's absolutely still the truth.

[00:51:14.850] - Speaker 3
Why was this research happening in the '50s? What were they trying to do?

[00:51:18.340] - Speaker 2
No, they were making polioviruses on the substrat. The way that you grow a vaccine- Why, though? To get to make a vaccine. When you mass use a vaccine, you need to grow the culture, and you have to grow it either on human tissue, which is hard to get, and the legal problems, and ethical moral problems. Also, there are disease problems because if the human has a disease, it could get in. The vaccine is not pure. A lot of that monkey material is getting into the vaccine, and the viruses were getting into the vaccine. And Bernice Eddie, right before they distributed the vaccine. There was 98 million doses about to be distributed. She goes to her boss's at NIH said, You can't do it because it's filled with this carcinogen that's going to give everybody cancer.

[00:52:12.700] - Speaker 1
She injected, just so you know, she injected the monkeys with the Qatar vaccine, and they got polio.

[00:52:19.750] - Speaker 2
But here's where the story- That is another part of that story.

[00:52:24.220] - Speaker 1
Let me tell you the part that I want you to hear. So guess who is a big investor in Qatar Pharmaceuticals? Alton Osher. What did he do? He got the entire medical staff in 1951 in the Ampitheater, brought his two grandchildren in, and injected his granddaughter and grandson. Oh, yeah, and they died. And the grand son died of polio five days later. Then guess what? The granddaughter got polio, so he survived. Who tells me this story is John Osher, the guy that I told you before.

[00:52:55.760] - Speaker 3
It's an unbelievable story.

[00:52:56.970] - Speaker 2
Bernese Addy reports this to her causes at any age. And they- Ignore her. They tell her to shut her mouth. Wow. Because there was so much publicity at that time that they had this vaccine that was going to eliminate polio. It was like a freight train or an engine that they could not stop. At this point, they said, No, we can't put the brakes on this thing. She then kept her mouth shut. But then about six months later, she was at a- New York Academy of Science meeting. Right. She went to a conference of scientists, and she was so frustrated at that conference, which was an insider's group. She told And NIH went beserk. They moved her to the basement. They took away her laboratory. They took away her telephone, and they told her that she was not allowed to talk to anybody without permission from the NIH bosses. She really- She was scrubbed from scientific history.

[00:54:06.590] - Speaker 1
But so was the people that worked with Bernese.

[00:54:11.170] - Speaker 2
And by the way, our generation, which is... I'm 69. How old are you? Sixty. Yeah. My generation was that baby boom generation. We all got that vaccine this year. I think the soft tissue cancer, which the cancers that it causes, are 10 times what they were in the previous generation for my generation, all these breast cancers, colon cancers, et cetera. And in many of those cancers, in the tumors, they find us V40.

[00:54:41.950] - Speaker 1
Wow. So, Rick, think about this. Who was the first head of the National Cancer Institute? Alton Osher. Who was one of his best friends? Richard Nixon. Who declared the war on Cancer? 1971. Richard Nixon and Alton Osher in the back seat of a Lincoln Continental. I told you I had the picture of it, right? So You asked Bobby a question earlier, how and why? Alton Osher knew that he caused a huge problem. So what was the solution? To go find the two best scientists in the world that could somehow figure out how to inactivate SV40. What was the idea? To go get an off-covert ops through the four congressmen I told you about Louisiana, Hale Boggs being one of them, and they got a Hill-Burton grant for Oschner to get a Linnack. The Linnack was put in the basement of the US Public- The Linnack is a-linear accelerator.

[00:55:41.780] - Speaker 2
Right, which is one of the most complex and expensive It's a piece of machine.

[00:55:45.640] - Speaker 1
Even today it is. But just so you know, Bobby- It was put in a-a US Public Health Hospital across the street from Children's Hospital on Henry Clay Boulevard.

[00:55:54.110] - Speaker 3
It makes no sense.

[00:55:55.370] - Speaker 1
Well, it makes a lot of sense when you understand the story that I want you to understand and how I came to know this stuff and why I came out so hard and heavy against COVID before the vaccines in 2020. When I told all my members, If you take this, you are going to have a problem down the road. Because I felt, and I've been vindicated now, that the same things that happened in that underground lab on magazine street and at the US Public Health Hospital would show up in Qatar 2. 0, which is what we're living through right now. And guess what? Kevin McKiernan was the first guy who did what Bernice Eddie did. He said, Look, just so you know, he's the guy that worked on the Human Genome Project. He's a molecular biologist, very good guy. He now works in the cannabis industry doing molecular biology for them. He happened just to take some expired vials, decided to check it, and he found the DNA plasmids, which shouldn't be in there, according to all the- Or the SV40? And regular DNA plasmids, and he reported it. So who got on his case?

[00:57:09.660] - Speaker 1
This guy named Philip Buckholtz, who is a huge geneticist from the University of South Carolina. So they got into a Twitter war, and Buckholz said, I'm just going to cut to the chase and prove this asshole wrong. So he does the same things, takes the same vials, and finds exactly the same result. A The reason I'm concerned now, because I made the-What does Buchholz do?

[00:57:33.680] - Speaker 2
Does he come clean?

[00:57:34.870] - Speaker 1
Oh, he's an academician who's totally part of the vaccine lobby. But guess what? Now he's confirmed the modern day Bernese said he's finding. So now where we are, and I know you've been busy the last couple of weeks, this is the latest current events going on in this world.

[00:57:54.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I saw references to it, but I haven't... That they've now found.

[00:57:59.340] - Speaker 1
They've found It. The reason why this is interesting- These contaminants.

[00:58:02.890] - Speaker 2
Why don't you explain what they are?

[00:58:04.450] - Speaker 1
What the DNA plasmid is. I want to go back to really what Sarah Stewart, Mary Stewart, and the Linnack meant for this. Why did Ostrner get in this game? He was trying to solve a problem that he caused. So he thought by radiating these viruses is a good idea. Sarah Stewart was the smart, smart, smart one. She went to medical school at the University of Chicago with Sarah Stewart, and she was the first one that ever came up with the idea that viruses caused cancer. Everybody in the NIH at that time thought she was batshit crazy, so they put her to the side until the stuff with polio showed up. Then she gets reassigned from the NIH to the US Public Health Hospital, where Mary Stuart is there. What is Sarah Stuart? Because Sarah Stuart wrote the recipe of how the science is done. Jim Garrison found it in David Ferry's apartment when he was dead. Sarah is the Einstein who's the theoretician to figure this out. Mary Stuart was the experimenter. She is the one that was trained in nuclear physics at the University of Chicago. She knew how to use a Linnack. So what did Osner do?

[00:59:21.410] - Speaker 1
With the help of the people in the government, remember, these are the people. Russell Long, who used to be UEP Long's son, is a prominent Senator, Eleanor, Hale bogs, there's all four. They control the entire military budget.

[00:59:35.330] - Speaker 2
Didn't one of the guys get fried in that linear accelerator?

[00:59:41.490] - Speaker 1
That's the story that I want to get to, Bobby, because guess what? Who got fried? It was Mary Stuart. Yeah, that's right. And Mary Stuart gets fried. Why? Because what was the goal?

[00:59:51.740] - Speaker 3
Explain getting fried.

[00:59:52.760] - Speaker 1
Well, we're going to get there, but there's parts of this that you need to hear.

[00:59:56.070] - Speaker 2
I remember reading about it, but it's not a good thing to walk into. No.

[01:00:01.280] - Speaker 1
Well, there was a guy. There was a guy that actually built linear accelerators. His name was Nygaard, and he happened to walk in front of one, and he completely disintegrated. He had no body left. But here's where the story gets interesting. What did Ossner do? He gets the people to give him a Hillburton grant. Hell bogs is one of those guys. They buy this machine, put it in the US Public Health Hospital, reassign Sarah Stewart, get Mary Stewart from Osner to go over there, then begin to irradiate the SV40 virus to try to kill it. What did they find experimentally? That they actually strengthened it, and it became a bioweapon. That's unbelievable. No, it's not unbelievable, because guess what? We know how it works. Why? Because let's fast forward now to today's scientists. Why did I warn people this was going to come? This guy Schlemmer figured out this is ancient to guys like Buchholz and and McKiernan, that 7% of DNA is naturally transmitted from the virus into humans. That's the base rate. When you add an X-ray, like the electromagnetic spectrum, You do the mix, you stimulate DNA repair. So you concentrate the effect.

[01:01:20.200] - Speaker 1
That's effectively what Mary Stuart found. Why doesn't modern-day McKiernan know this? Bobby probably is already putting this together because this was a covert operation that was never published in the literature. So he has nothing to go back and say, Why did this happen? I'm telling you why it happened. Because at the time in New Orleans, when Ashtar saw that he couldn't solve the SV40 problem, he actually saw another way to take care of his Cuban problem. If you make this virus and put it in tobacco or get somebody to inject, guess what? You can induce He answered, literally, overnight, even in humans. And guess what? Ferry, Judith Ferry-Baker, Lee Harvey-Ouswald, and Mary Stuart found that it worked. Why did Clay Shaw get put on trial by Garrison? Why was he the guy? Because the day before Martin Luther King's speech, I Have A Dream, Clay Shaw drove his black catalog to Clinton, Louisiana, with David Ferry and Lee Harvey Oswald, where they transferred from Angola Prison to a mental hospital in Clinton, Louisiana. Why did they pick Clinton? Because it's a sleepy little town, mostly black. Nobody would be there. But what magically happened that day, to let you know that the orthodoxy behind his uncle and his father's ultimate demise was coming, Lee Harvey Oswell decided to register to vote in the middle of a black town the day of I Have A Dream breach.

[01:03:00.820] - Speaker 1
The reason for that is because that's the day they were going to inject a bioweapon into the prisoner. When did all Hellbreaker loose? It worked. They brought Judith Veri Baker up to test the prisoner who got the cancer literally and was dead within two weeks. She went nuclear on Alton Ostrum because she was promised, as part of this lab, that she would be able to go into Tulane Medical School, get advanced standing because of all the work that she was doing with Sarah Stewart and Mary Stewart. She takes off Alton Osher says, You're never going to medical school. You're done. Just so you know the timeline here, this is the end of August of '63. The timeline between the people in the book that you talked about before, this was a race. Do we get Kennedy or do we get Castro? Then they knew that they had this weapon. Here was their problem. Do you remember when Lee Harvey Oswald defected to Russia and then went to Mexico? Everybody was like, This seems like the weirdest story. They needed him to defect to Russia so that he could get in to Cuba to deliver the bioweapon.

[01:04:07.750] - Speaker 1
Turns out there was a big flying at ointment that Castro was on top of that. So what happens eventually? The whole lab dissipates, goes away. Six months later, after his uncle was killed, Mary Stuart is going back to continue her research, and magically, the kill switch, there's a huge problem. She grabs it with her right-hand, pulls it down. Her right arm is completely disintegrated. Her thoracic cavity is exposed, underlying organs exposed. This, of course, makes big news in New Orleans. It's in the Times-picking, and the NOPD says that it was a mattress fire that caused this problem.

[01:04:49.920] - Speaker 2
Well, they took her body and put it in.

[01:04:51.750] - Speaker 1
They moved the body from the US Public Health Hospital to there. Here's the thing, nick Chetta- To her apartment.

[01:04:59.720] - Speaker 2
And And then they had a mattress.

[01:05:01.590] - Speaker 1
Right. And they lit it on fire.

[01:05:03.280] - Speaker 2
They lit on fire, but it only half burned. It just was...

[01:05:09.800] - Speaker 1
There was no way that the forensics matched the injury.

[01:05:12.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Anybody knew that. Actually, I think in that The book that you gave me before, I think it was Mary's Monkey, the author of that book describes graphically, and very interesting, that he goes to a lot of crematoriums, and he interviews the people in the crematoriums about what does it take to actually disintegrate a human body, and it has to get up to hundreds of- 2000 C, because what's always left is the bones. But remember, all time he looks at how hot- The coffee photos shows he has no right arm.

[01:05:47.600] - Speaker 1
The bones aren't even there.

[01:05:49.100] - Speaker 2
Right. Yeah, that's right, because the crematorium said, and you can't get rid of the bones.

[01:05:55.000] - Speaker 1
They have to grind it up. That's actually what's in your ashes. People probably listening to this and probably go, Great. I don't want to know this now.

[01:06:01.620] - Speaker 2
Then he looks at the calculator. Then he talks to people about what temperature a mattress burns at. The mattress was just singed. It wasn't even properly burned.

[01:06:15.090] - Speaker 1
Long story short, though, this murder goes down six months after his uncle's killed. But do you know why? Because she was the only link. What happens in the autopsy, nick Chetter, the same guy we talked about, Ferry, does the autopsy on her and finds that there was a surgical wound placed between her sixth and across the space, neither one of you are doctors, but you happen to be sitting next to one, I'm going to tell you that's exactly a kill shot to get into someone's heart. Why was That's not the case? Because when she got this electricity, she wasn't grounded. I went down to this hospital when I was a resident, and there was huge grounding things on either side. That current went straight through her. She was still alive when this injury happened. So they transport her. The reason they had to get rid of her is because she was the hard link evidence back to Ossher. That was the thing that I was very concerned about. Now, I didn't tell you this earlier. How did I put all this together? You know who my emergency room nurse was in my first month of residency?

[01:07:24.640] - Speaker 1
Virginia Garrison. She worked with me in Charity Hospital.

[01:07:28.500] - Speaker 2
What is her relationship to Jim?

[01:07:30.770] - Speaker 1
She's Jim's daughter. She told me, she goes, I know that later in your neurosurgery residency, you're going to go to Austin. She goes, I want to tell you, be very careful when you go over there. I thought this was shocking because this is a woman who was just like her dad. She was a bulldog. I'll never forget what she said to me. She goes, Just be careful, especially with the sons of Alton. Because at that time, Alton Austin died in '81. He dead about 9 or 10 years. Everybody in New Orleans to this day still thinks glowing things about him. But when I got into neurosurgery and I started to realize, going down to the basement, the Linnack moved from Mary Stuart injury. They called the Linnack guy up to reconfigure the platinum hood, it shows up in the basement of the place I do my residency.

[01:08:21.500] - Speaker 2
Where is it now?

[01:08:23.220] - Speaker 1
Well, I can't tell you where it is now, but it was in the basement of my residency when I graduated in '99. I I can tell you that I used it with the neurosurgeons there to do brain tumor surgery, Acoustic neuromas, and things like that. The reason I want to bring this up to you is because I had the opportunity to talk to J. O. Before he died. He told me straight up that his dad worked for the FBI, and he worked for the CIA. The reason that nobody knew that Tulane University was on par with Harvard, Hopkins, and the Mayo Clinic is because this stuff, the stuff that you wrote about in Fauci's book about Fort Dietrich. I want you to know the original lab was on magazine street, and it was in the US Public Health Hospital. It was then transferred to the Yurx lab that I worked at as a resident And then in the Yorks lab, I happened to work with an anesthesiologist whose dad is really the first person that ran the Delta Primate Center in Covington. Hopefully, your question that fits maybe, this would be probably chapter zero of your Fauci book.

[01:09:35.380] - Speaker 1
Where did all the stuff that Osner and Ferry and Mary Stuart go? It's my belief that it went to the Delta Primate Center in Cummington, Louisiana. And that happened in '64. Where was it eventually transferred? To Fort Dietrich. And that's when Bobby Kennedy's book picks it up. And the reason why I think this is important, Bobby, especially with you running for President now, my belief is if we forget history, we're doomed to repeat it, and I'm seeing it unfold. This story that started with your family back in the '50s and '60s is now manifesting right now. This is how I feel, and I probably shouldn't get political about this, but I'm going to. The day your uncle was killed, the heart of the American populace was removed. In '68, when Martin Luther King and your dad were killed, that's when the head and the soul of the country was morbidly injured. I think what you're doing right now, the way you've come to One, this is the heart transplant that America needs right now. It's a travesty, considering what we've talked about today, what your family has been through, and what you've done. I mean, let's face it, you put the target on your back.

[01:10:58.180] - Speaker 2
I will say this because it's of interest what you said. This morning, I had a guy come over my fence. That's why I was late getting here. A guy who had previously sent me a week ago an email through another person that gave it to me, threatening to put a bullet in my head. This morning, my security guard saw him come over the fence and were able to arrest him. But that's why I was late coming here. One of the issues, I'm worried about my family. Of course. My wife was doing a Twitter space at the time and watched him come over and then get arrested. But also it's disturbing to every... It ought to be disturbing to every American because it's part of this politicization of law enforcement agencies, which we've which is one of the first things my dad did when he got to the Justice Department was to call all the attorneys into a conference and say there's going to be no political prosecutions here, that we treat everybody the same. And he ended up prosecuting people who he knew well, including his brother-in-law on an antitrust issue. President Biden has a bus, my father, behind him on the oval office.

[01:12:36.960] - Speaker 2
But this is something my father felt very strongly about, about not politicizing the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, the IRS, et cetera. And it's disturbing that that's happening today. But it is so relevant to what's happening, which is really the decline of the Republic. And we know it's going to happen at some point. There's empire that's lasted this long. Actually, democracy is such a tiny sliver of the human experience. There's never really been a democratic government. Democratic government is rare in the human experience. We know it's unstable and it's fragile, and we know that it can't last forever. But I don't think any of us saw it declining so precipitously. My uncle came office with this with a real antipathy toward war. He immediately encountered the military-industry complex, and he said that he didn't want African children to and Latin-American children and Asian children, when they heard about the United States of America, to think of a man with a gun. He wanted them to think of a Peace Corps volunteer, of the Kennedy Milk program, which gave nutrition to tens of millions of malnourished kids around the world and the Alliance for Progress and USAID, which he created to put America on the side of the poor and run the military juntas, the oligarchies, who were hoarding American dollars at that point, and instead put it into actually building middle classes in this country and creating democracy.

[01:14:23.790] - Speaker 2
Then four months in, the Bay of Pigs invasion, he was lied to by Dulles, by Richard Bissell, by Charles about the three top officers of the CIA. When the men were dying on the beach, which was the lowest point in his presidency, he publicly took the blame for the invasion of that episode, but privately, he said to his aides, I want to take the CIA, chatter it into a thousand pieces, and scatter it to the winds.

[01:14:53.690] - Speaker 1
Bobby, I don't think a lot of people know how all these pieces all fit together. I cannot believe that the President of this country doesn't have the common sense to protect you, irrespective of what the rules and everything else say. Just for what your family has been through, we owe it to you as taxpayers And for him to make that decision, to me, is unforgivable, absolutely unforgivable. For anybody to question you why you're not going to run as a Democrat and you're going to run as an independent, that alone stands as a perfect reason why you need to do it. The key thing is people need to know that freedom is under attack. It's under attack in many different ways. The architects that Eisenhower talked about are now taking pitchforks, chainsaws, and nuclear weapons to the pillars of this country, what's in our Constitution. All of us, collectively, We have to come together and say, We're sick and tired of this shit. We need to take the country back. We need to do what's right. We may not always agree on every single issue, but the one issue that we do need to agree about, this country is about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

[01:16:19.420] - Speaker 1
It's in the founding documents. But guess what? John Adams and Thomas Jefferson never thought that the angle of attack to the US Constitution would Anthony Fauci. It took 200 years to get there until we get the Bayes Dole Act, then back it up with the '86 vaccine. People forget.

[01:16:41.500] - Speaker 2
The Bayes Dole Act is the act that allowed researchers at NIH to collect royalties on any medical product that they work on. Actually, NIH- So it incentivizes that.

[01:16:58.020] - Speaker 3
Correct.

[01:16:58.200] - Speaker 2
It incentivizes that, correct? It incentivizes exactly. It's a perverse incentive that encourages a regular. The regulator is supposed to find problems with the product. Yes. You've got now, I'll give you an example. The Moderna vaccine is owned by NIH, half of it. Half the royalties go to NIH, and then there's six individuals that were handpicked by Anthony Fauci who work for NIH who have margin rights for the patent. So they can get royalties of $150,000 a year for as long as that product is on the market as mRNA vaccines, which will be indefinitely on the market. So they're paying for their houses, their kids' education, their boats with that. And they now have very little incentive to find problems with that product. They Their incentive is to make sure that there is maximum uptake of that project because that maximizes their income. The mercantile ambitions of these individuals, the institutions The regulation itself, as you can see, will ultimately naturally subsume the regulatory function of the agency, which is to protect public health above anything else. It's not a good system. And that all started the Biden Act, which I think is 1984.

[01:18:34.250] - Speaker 1
1980. And then the '86 Act came in. But the point that I want to add to the Sunday he just built for you, this is the cherry, just realized in the last four months that Anthony Fauci and Collins got royalties over $350 million.

[01:18:53.970] - Speaker 2
Just realized that- Well, the two of them did not get those royalties. People who work...

[01:18:59.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah, But they get to dictate where the money goes. That's right.

[01:19:05.620] - Speaker 3
Tell me your understanding of the medical-industrial complex.

[01:19:09.800] - Speaker 2
I don't know whether you'd call it a cartel, but it's what I would describe as a corrupt merger of state and corporate power. Oh, it's all of these dynamics and mechanisms of what we call agency capture. I wish the regulated industries... The regulated industries, the regulator becomes a sock puppet for the industry it's supposed to regulate. There's a well-documented phenomena that happens everywhere and to different extents and agencies all over the world in every state. But it's on steroids in the United States because you not only have a pharmaceutical industry that's making that is now the biggest industry in the world, but you also have the regulatory agencies that are financially tied to the pharmaceutical industry. For example, 40% or 45% of FDA's budget comes from pharma, which is crazy. It's like if I... E EPA is a captured agency. It's captured by oil and coal and pesticides, not by pharmaceutical. It'd be hard for me to imagine how much worse EPA would be if it got 50% of its revenues from coal companies. Which it doesn't. It was dependent on the coal companies making money. When I sued Monsanto, we came across an email emails that showed that the head of the Pesticide Division at Monsanto for a decade was secretly working for...

[01:21:08.870] - Speaker 2
I mean, the head of the Pesticide Division at EPA was secretly working for Monsanto, and he was taking instructions from them. In one point, they tell him to kill a study that's being done by another agency, and he said, That's not even my agency. I'm going to kill it for you, but you got to give me a gold medal. And the first two cases, they wouldn't let us show that to the jury. The third judge did, and that's why we got 2. 2 billion, and that is what brought Monsanto to the negotiating table. That goes on throughout the industry. But what's happening with the public health agencies where 45 % of CDC's budget goes to purchasing vaccines and then promoting their uptake. So you don't get promoted at CDC. I find problems with vaccines. You get promoted by increasing update. And that's how your salary, your evaluations, your promotions are linked to that. And then NIH, which is the FDA, CDC, and NIH. Nih, as I explained earlier, the people in NIH are actually allowed to collect royalties on the vaccines they work on. Nih is now the biggest incubator of pharmaceutical products. It used to do straight science, but what it does now is it it produces new drugs for the pharmaceutical industry and then profits on them.

[01:22:33.870] - Speaker 2
Their regulatory function has become corrupted. Then you have these other very, very troubling ingredients, which is the involvement of the military and the intelligence apparatus in vaccine production, and with other drugs, too. But vaccines are a component of every bioweapon. We launched a bioweapon's arm's raised after the anthrax attacks in 2001. Biowepons had been illegalized prior to that. But the Patriot Act has a provision in it. And I'll tell you what Can I tell you a little bit about the history? Please. Okay. You talked about Operation Paper Club. Operation Paper Club was the first CIA project. So it began literally in 1947. The The month that the CIA was created, and the first mission of the CIA was Operation Paper Club, which was a project to take the Nazi scientists who had worked on missile production, on bio weapon production, chemical weapon production, and make sure they weren't hanged at Nuremberg, because a lot of them had to engage in those endeavors in creating those, they had to use slave labor. And the I. G. Farben, which created the Zycon B gas that was used to gas the Jews at Auschwitz and the other death Amps, was the biggest pharmaceutical company.

[01:24:18.200] - Speaker 2
It was a major player in the Third Reich. There were entire trials at Nuremberg that are called the IG Farman Trials, where their entire executive suite was jailed because I think they had 60,000 slaves, and they worked to death 30,000 of those. They were also doing a lot of human experimentation and all of this stuff. But they were developing gasses, and they were developing bio weapons for the Third Reich, which during the World War II, they didn't use. Japan had a much more extensive program under a scientist called Shiro Ishi, who was like the men galley of Japan. They had an extensive bio weapon program. They killed, they used bio weapons during their war with China, which was happening simultaneously to World War II. They killed a half million Chinese using biowepons. They're the only ones really to deploy it at scale. The CIA's job was to go get those scientists, make sure they weren't executed, give them new names, give them the new opportunities, and then bring them over. Recruit them, basically.

[01:25:34.080] - Speaker 3
What? Recruit them.

[01:25:35.460] - Speaker 2
Recruit them to Fort Dietrich or to some other bio labs that we had in the United States so that we could put them to work developing biowe weapons. Here. Our bio weapons, we began pouring money in. It was run by George Merck, the head of Merck. Roosevelt recruited him to run it, and it was being run. It It was run between 1947 and 1969. You know Stanley Gottlieb? Absolutely. He was one of the really terrible human beings who was running MKUltra programs in Operation Artichoke. Mk, MK Naomi, MK Dietrich, MKUltra. The MK Prefix means mind control. So they were studying, they were studying. They were using- LSD? Yeah, well, they did everything. They did psychotropic drugs. They did hypnosis. They did sensory deprivation. They did all kinds of developing, all kinds of poisons, all kinds of torture devices and propaganda. They were studying at hundreds of universities where they were pumping money to social scientists at universities to study how do you control human behavior on an individual basis including how do you create Manchurian candidates, involuntary assassins, and then how do you do mass control? What are the propaganda techniques that work? If a foreign entity wants to impose control on Indigenous cultures.

[01:27:20.280] - Speaker 2
They were studying all these things for years. Those used a lot of chemicals which were tied to Fort Dietrich, which was the big lab that was created around that time. But they were also dosing. They were doing open air. They did over 100 open air trials where they would try out chemicals. They would dose San Francisco, or they would dose some other American city. They did St. Louis. Yeah, the New York City subway systems. That's true. They dosed National Airport, the air conditioning system. They were probably 50 cities in the United States.

[01:28:06.500] - Speaker 3
From the beginning, they weren't doing this to control other people. They were developing these to control- They were testing it on America.

[01:28:14.230] - Speaker 2
One, to test the vulnerability of America to a foreign biowequence attack. That's what they said they were doing. And by the way, it was all being supervised by Nazi scientists. It was really bizarre.

[01:28:28.020] - Speaker 1
It's so crazy. I mean, It's too much. It's unbelievable.

[01:28:32.030] - Speaker 2
In 1969, they had reached nuclear equivalence. They could kill the entire US population, they said, for 29 cents per death, which was better than you could do with a nuclear bomb, with a nuclear bombs. Of that ear, Nixon does the greatest thing that he did, which is he goes to Fort Dietrich and he said, We're shutting it all down.

[01:28:54.080] - Speaker 1
The only thing I think he did in his presidency, that was good.

[01:28:56.750] - Speaker 2
They realized that, well, he passed the Clean Air Act, Clean in Iraq. He created EPA. He did a lot of it kicking and screaming, but he did some good stuff. But what they realized is that they were creating poor man's nuclear bombs, that if they could keep a monopoly on new that they were in good shape because there's only a few people who could afford the program. If you develop a bioweapon, the scientists who develop it gets his credentials from publishing. So they were publishing what they were doing. They weren't widely read, but they were accessible to anybody who wanted them. And they basically gave them blueprints for creating these things in a garage. Wow. And they realized we're creating things that are going to be used against us and that can be developed on a busman's budget with nuclear equivalents. Yes. So they realized this is a bad thing. And Nixon and Kissinger decided to shut it down, and they unilaterally shut down all biowe weapons developments. Right at the time, they were closing Fort Dittrich. They were destroying all of their stocks. The CIA, Stanley Gottlieb, Sydney Gottlieb, went in, who's this guy who was this really insane scientist who was...

[01:30:21.450] - Speaker 2
One of his principal obsessions was head transplants, which he was doing a lot of on primates. He was trying- I told Rick, I actually have pictures from the Eric's lab.

[01:30:33.960] - Speaker 1
I actually showed it to him yesterday of the things that I used to see that we would take the skulls off, put the wires in, and do all kinds of different things. People don't realize that this stuff was going on in American universities everywhere. Tulane was one of the CIA's hotspots, which is why nobody to this day knows that they were on par with Harvard, Hopkins, and Mayo.

[01:31:01.710] - Speaker 2
In '69, he says all over, Gottlieb goes in there into the Fort Dietrich lab and takes the worst cultures that they had and smuggles them out and stores them in warehouses in New York. And so the CIA maintains this ability to continue to develop these cultures. In '73, thanks to Nixon, basically, 100 countries signed a biowe weapons charter making it illegal to research biowe weapons, et cetera. That shut it down. The CIA was secretly still doing it with Patel. You know Patel, the engineering firm, and they developed an anthrax bombs. They did it all top secret and illegally. But generally, it was shut down in this country. And then in a 9/11, we get attacked. And a week A week later, there's an anthrax attack. The anthrax is then used as a pre-tence. It's blamed on Saddam Hussein. It's used as a pre-tence to go to war with Iraq and to pass the Patriot Act.

[01:32:16.090] - Speaker 1
45 days.

[01:32:17.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Who got a hit with the anthrax? The two senators who were leading the fight against the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act was taken off the shelf on 9/11 and rammed through Congress. Nobody read it. The only congressman to actually read it was Dennis Kucinich, who was until recently running my campaign.

[01:32:36.890] - Speaker 1
Also, give credit to Barbara Lee. She's the one that voted against it and took a lot of heat.

[01:32:41.630] - Speaker 2
Kucinich voted against it, too. But the Patriot Act, then, the two senators who were sent anthrax were the two guys who were leading the fight against the Patriot Act, Tom Dashiell and Lehi. It shuts down Congress. The act passes in record time. Nobody has read it, but one of the provisions of the Patriot Act says that the Bio weapons charter still stands, and the Geneva Convention, which made a death penalty for developing bio weapons, still stands. However, no federal officer can be prosecuted for violations of those acts.

[01:33:23.010] - Speaker 1
How do you like that? Indemnification.

[01:33:24.880] - Speaker 2
Basically, they got rid of the Patriot Act. Now, what happened, the The back story is the FBI investigates the origins of anthrax, which we're already at war with Saddam for hitting us with anthrax. And after a year, the FBI determines this was Ames anthrax, a highly sophisticated, weaponized Ames anthrax. That could only have come from Fort Dietrich. How do you like that? It was somebody associated with the Fort Dietrich, which either has to be the army or the CIA.

[01:34:00.030] - Speaker 3
It's an inside job.

[01:34:01.380] - Speaker 2
Right. It's not to me. Yeah. So now they've reopened the arms race, the weapons arms race, because now Americans... But the Pentagon is worried about launching an arms race because it is a death penalty. And what if the Patriot Act turns out not to be legitimate? Usually, you can't override a treaty with statutorially.

[01:34:28.340] - Speaker 1
That means treason They can be killed.

[01:34:31.450] - Speaker 2
You can be hang. It's a capital offense.

[01:34:33.680] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[01:34:34.610] - Speaker 2
The Pentagon didn't want to openly start a biowe weapons program, so they began funneling money, about $2 billion a year to NIH, specifically to NIAID. They made Anthony Fauci, the lead developer, biosecurity developer, which means biowe weapons developer.

[01:34:54.050] - Speaker 1
Starting to see where this is all headed.

[01:34:56.010] - Speaker 2
He then gets a 68% raise from the Pentagon. And that's why he was the highest paid official in American history. He was getting $450,000 a year. The President gets $400,000. I think there's 2. 3 million federal employees. He got paid more than any of them. The reason was because the Pentagon had more than doubled his salary to give him responsibility for biowequence development. Now, immediately, he opens all these BSL 4 labs in Boston in, Galveston, all over the country at North Carolina, and he pays for them out of his money. But then in 2014, three of his bugs escape, high-profile escapes. They find leaks. They found a smallpox that somebody had left in an unprotected in a lab, in a broken box. And 300 scientists, top scientists in the country like Richard Ebert, send a letter to Obama saying, You have to shut down Anthony Fauci because he's going to cause a global pandemic. And Obama declares a moratorium, shuts down 18 projects of Fauci's. And Fauci responds to that is to move his operations to Wuhan. And that's how we end up in Wuhan. And and share the technology, cutting-edge technology with Xi Jinping Li and Ben Hu and all these scientists over there, Linfa Thang, the scientists over there who were ultimately responsible for developing the virus that caused COVID-19, almost 100 % certainly.

[01:36:54.890] - Speaker 3
Tell me about the Monsanto trial.

[01:36:57.920] - Speaker 2
Monsanto is a company... Well, Monsanto was a company that I was fighting since I was young. I mean, I met Rachel Carson at my house when I was a boy. She had written the book. Up until then, the pesticides and the pesticide scientists were the heroes. They had helped win the war against Hitler. Most deaths at that time were from infectious diseases that were spread by sex. Bdt had stopped malaria in its tracks, et cetera, in the Japanese wars. So they had won the war against Hitler. Now, they were going to win the war against the bugs, and we were going to finally have abundant food. The pest would be eliminated, et cetera. Everybody considered them the hero until 1961. Rachel Carson published this book that shows Americans, and she was a beautiful, beautiful writer. Her writing is like poetry. She was a marine biologist who was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, never saw the ocean until she was 22 years old. But she had this gift for conveying complex scientific concepts to the public in lay language and beautiful full poetic lay language. Her book became a world-record best seller. Silence Spring. Silence Spring. And she basically showed the public that although on the outside it looked like pets were being killed, we were all getting killed, and our pets were getting killed, and the birds were going to disappear.

[01:38:34.300] - Speaker 2
And these pets were actually critical part of the food web for America's songbird population. And that's why the title, Silent Spring, is that the bird songs are going to be extinguished. She came under attack by Monsanto, which was the manufacturer of TDT, which did the blueprint for the tobacco industry and everything else. How do you discredit? How do you destroy this scientist? They did everything publicly. Every time they referred to her, they would call her Espenser, which was the modern or the a temporary pejorative that suggested lesbianism. And so they went after her. She was dying of cancer, and she never rose to defend herself. My uncle appointed a commission to study the and the commission came back and completely vindicated hers. They went through everything. She had three references for every factual assertion of the book because she knew she was going to be attacked. She was a very careful scientist. My uncle vindicated her, and DDT ended up getting banned in '73. She inspired Earth Day in '70, and then '73 DDT is banned. Monsanto needs a new blockbuster flag ship product. At that time, somebody had invented glyphosate as a tank to scalant to get the corrosion and the calcification and the rust from the inside of the storage tanks.

[01:40:21.570] - Speaker 2
Something happened. I mean, this is a simplification of a long story, but somebody throws this stuff out in the yard, and they see all the grass is dead. They say, Oh, this could be a good herbicide. And Monsanto needed a new product, so it gets this herbicide. For the first 20 years, it's supplied by men from farmworkers' backpack spray bags. They walk through the cornfields. When they see the weed, they spray, give it a little jolt, and it dies. They don't have to bend over and pull it up. So it saves time. In '93, somebody sprays it on on, this is, again, a simplification of the story. Somebody sprays it on a weed that doesn't die, and they realize that weed has genetic immunity. They remove the gene from that weed, they identify it, and they put it in a corn seed. Now they've got corn called Roundup Ready Corn, which is immune to glyphosate. Now they can fire all the farm workers. They fly an airplane, one guy in an airplane over, saturate the entire landscape with Roundup, and everything green dies except the Roundup Ready Corn. It becomes very, very cheap for the first couple of years before the causes start living in.

[01:41:48.000] - Speaker 3
Then- Would you still call it corn or is it a new thing, this Roundup Ready Corn?

[01:41:52.100] - Speaker 2
You can dispute the angels on the head of the bin, but it is a GMO. It's a GMO. It's a GMO. It's a GMO corn.

[01:41:59.500] - Speaker 1
It's an A million that lives on the planet.

[01:42:02.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It quickly captures 85% of the corn market. In this country, 99%. There's all kinds of other problems that go along with it. They own it, and they won't give you seeds for the next year, so you have to buy it from them every year, and there's all these losses. It's a nightmare for farmers, but they end up becoming, getting on that gerble wheel and not being able to get off. Then in 2006, they discovered that glyphosate… By now, they have Roundup Ready corn, Roundup Ready Soy, I think, barley, a bunch of other. So now everything's roundup ready, but not wheat. Wheat is where you eat most of it. It's in your bread, your pasta, your cereal, all this stuff. They roundup ready. So They don't round up ready wheat, but what they find is that if you spray Roundup on the wheat right before harvest, it dries it out. If there's a rainstorm, a spring rain or autumn rain, you won't get mold on it, which mold is a huge drain on farm income. Especially weed farmers. They tell all the farmers, Start spraying it as a desiccant, and they do it. Now, what that means is that Roundup, that almost all, probably 90% of the roundup that's ever been sold has been sold between 2006 and now, because that was the biggest use.

[01:43:40.260] - Speaker 2
But now they're spreading it directly on food because it's right before harvest. This stuff is ready to go to the mill. Before, they were spreading it early in the season on weeds until they couldn't catch up with the corn. And then you don't care about the weeds anymore, right? Most of it was getting washed off during the year. Now, they're spraying it right on food. All of a sudden that year, you see this burst in gluten allergies and celiac disease.

[01:44:12.640] - Speaker 3
When you say it washes off the food, where does it go?

[01:44:16.270] - Speaker 2
Well, it goes into the soil and it destroys the soil biome, which is not good for anything.

[01:44:24.640] - Speaker 1
No. It's not good for anything that's decentralized.

[01:44:26.530] - Speaker 3
In the short term, it destroys what it's destroying. But in the long term, if you wash it off, it's destroying whatever.

[01:44:32.790] - Speaker 1
Destroy photosynthesis. That's what it does. Which is the basis of the entire food web. But it eventually goes in our groundwater and eventually into our waterways.

[01:44:40.280] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it doesn't have Let me put it this way, an enduring half-life. It's not like Atrazine or PFOA that once they're in your water, that you're- Those are the Forever chemicals?

[01:44:56.360] - Speaker 3
Yeah. Can you explain what Forever chemicals are?

[01:44:59.650] - Speaker 2
The Forever chemicals are chemicals that... I mean, PFOA is the most notorious one, and I've litigated on that, too. They made a film about my lawsuit called Dark Waters with Mark Ruffalo on that suit. But your body cannot process them. The molecules just bio-accumulate, and they cause all kinds of problems, including a lot of them are endocrine disruptors, but they're carcinogenic. The atrazine is the worst endocrine disruptor. It literally... There's this very famous experiment where this guy, Dr. Tyler, I forget what his last name, but you can look at Google, and he took 27 male frogs and put them in aquariums with water that was contaminated with atrazine at levels that were below the EPA impermissible rate for drinking water.

[01:46:02.250] - Speaker 3
This is water that could be in the drinking water supply.

[01:46:05.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that EPA, there would be no trigger if up until that, the public water supply has no duty to tell you that it's in there because it's not at a danger level. Okay.

[01:46:17.470] - Speaker 3
What happened to the frogs?

[01:46:18.630] - Speaker 2
Of the 27 male frogs, 20 of them became sterile. Seven of the males turned female and were able to produce fertile eggs frogs. It sounds incredible, but all you have to do is just Google the 27 male frogs. The first name of the scientist is Tyler. I forget. But anyway, it's a- They're well-known study. It's a pretty well-known study.

[01:46:47.170] - Speaker 1
It's a science. We've known about it for a long time, and it's a huge problem.

[01:46:52.600] - Speaker 3
Is that one of the things that you fought against?

[01:46:55.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah, atrazine.

[01:46:58.020] - Speaker 3
Who makes atrazine What's it used for?

[01:47:00.670] - Speaker 1
It's a pharmaceutical company.

[01:47:01.920] - Speaker 3
But do you know what it was used for?

[01:47:03.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's a pesticide. Pesticide. Anyway, I'm with Monsanto, and you asked, how do you break up the medical industrial complex? How do you get decentralized medicine? Correct. If I'm present, I can do that, and I know exactly how it works.

[01:47:23.350] - Speaker 1
Tell me. I'm very interested.

[01:47:25.120] - Speaker 2
First of all, I'm going to go to NIH, to Bethesda, my first week in I'm going to say them, the NIH is a $42 billion budget. It's giving that money to 56,000 scientists who are mainly universities in the US. They're getting this, and a lot of them are doing drug development. The rest of them are mainly studying infectious disease in which there's a lot of money, and they do gain a function. But infectious disease is not the big problem in this country, chronic disease. We've gone from a chronic disease rate of 6% when my uncle was President, 11. 8% 1986 to 54% in 2006. Then NIH stopped publishing that data. We don't know those data.

[01:48:14.560] - Speaker 1
We don't know what it is. We know it's a lot higher than 54%.

[01:48:18.000] - Speaker 2
It's probably 60%. I mean, one out of every seven kids now has autoimmune disease.

[01:48:23.380] - Speaker 1
Just think about this. This is what I said to you yesterday about centralized medicine is if you look at it just on a financial basis, the return on equity. Bobby will tell you, we spend more money in this country, and we get the lowest return on equity for health.

[01:48:37.140] - Speaker 2
It's a huge problem. The budget for health is 4. 3 trillion. The military, including National Security is 1. 3 trillion. So it's 4. 3 trillion. 3. 7 trillion goes to chronic disease, which was practically nothing. It's 22 times higher than was being spent in 1960 in relationship to GDP. We had during COVID, this shows you the impact of that. We had during COVID, the highest death rate, the body count in the world. We had 16% of the COVID deaths. We only have 4. 2% of the global population. I don't know why people are getting medals and million dollar awards.

[01:49:25.970] - Speaker 1
Or a Nobel Prize. Yeah.

[01:49:27.510] - Speaker 2
It makes no sense. Right. Because we They mishandled it.

[01:49:30.460] - Speaker 1
We're rewarding shitheads.

[01:49:32.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And part of that is because of mismanagement, catastrophic mismanagement and data chaos and all this stuff that went along with it. But also we have the highest chronic disease burden in the world. And CDC said the average person who died from COVID had 3. 8 chronic disease. They had obesity, diabetes, asthma, and something else. Then some of them had eight or nine. So we're the sickest population. And That makes us more of these people were not dying of COVID. They were dying. We're dying of COVID. Covid pushed them off the cliff. So I'm going to go over there and I'm going to say, Look, we're going to give infectious disease a break, and we're going to find out what's causing the chronic disease epidemic. Now, Autism rates have gone from 1 in 10,000 in my generation. So men today, right now, of my generation, 1 in 10,000 have a full-blown autism, which means nonverbal, non-toilet-trained Headbanging, stemming, hand flapping, toe walking, the stereotypic carat features of autism. One in 10,000. In my kid's generation, it's one in 34 children.

[01:50:46.450] - Speaker 1
That breaks every law of neo-Darwinism, Darwinism. Everything is completely backwards.

[01:50:54.240] - Speaker 2
Congress said to EPA, Tell us what year it started. They didn't ask CDC. They That's EPA. Epa is a captive agency, but it's captured by oil, coal, and pesticide, not by pharma because it doesn't regulate pharma. It came back with a real science, and it said it's a red line, 1989. 1989 also was the year that all of these other crimes, many of the other ones, food allergies suddenly appeared, peanut allergies.

[01:51:20.300] - Speaker 3
What happened in '89?

[01:51:21.820] - Speaker 2
Okay, let me tell you what happened in '89. Neurological disease, ADD, ADHD. Speech language Tick, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, suddenly exploded, juvenile diabetes I never saw as a kid suddenly exploded, lupus, Crohn's, all these weird diseases that we never heard of, suddenly they're everywhere. Then the allergic diseases like peanut allergies, food allergies, eczema. You never heard of eczema as a kid, right? Now, every classroom has kids with eczema, and all of these, asthma exploded. My brother had asthma. He was told by a doctor, he was told, there'll never be a cure for asthma because it's so rare that nobody will ever study it. Well, now it's one out of every eight Black kids in our city. And this '89 was the banner year when all this stuff starts happening. We know it's an environmental toxin because genes don't cause epidemics. Genes, they can provide the vulnerability.

[01:52:26.620] - Speaker 1
Say that again. Because you know what? That's what decentralized medicine has been pounding the table about for 20 years.

[01:52:34.770] - Speaker 3
It's not genetic.

[01:52:36.580] - Speaker 1
It's not genetic.

[01:52:37.300] - Speaker 2
They can provide the vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin.

[01:52:40.220] - Speaker 1
Remember what I said to Huberman? I said that the NIH spends their money. It's focusing on RNA and DNA when the real problem is the mitochondrial DNA, which is the environmental smoking gum. Bobby just said it loud and clear.

[01:52:53.300] - Speaker 2
There's a toxicologist, a very famous toxicologist called Phil Landry, and he's outside in New York, and I've used him on a lot of cases. He's shy of me because he knows vaccines is a death trap for anybody of his prominence. He won't go there, but he knows something happened in '89. So he's done a bunch of papers that says, Okay, what could it be? There's a limited universe of things that... And you have to find a toxin. It became ubiquitous that year. So every A demographic from Cubans and Kibiskein to Inuit and Alaska are affected. And then there's some other features that are interesting, which is it should be a toxin that affects boys at a 4: 1 a ratio of neurological disorders, a 4: 1 ratio to girls, right? Because that's one of the features of this, that boys are deeply impacted by all these neurological injuries. And so he's come up with, I think, about 13 suspects and I can't tell you what all of them are, but PFOA is one. Follow the timeline, which are flame retardant that was put in all of our furniture, childblood, pajamas around that area. Glyphosate, okay, Which, again, around the early '90s, '93 is when they developed a round of ready Corn.

[01:54:22.820] - Speaker 2
Atrazine, neonicotoid pesticides, same timeline, cell phone, WiFi, radiation. There you are, ENF. Right.

[01:54:30.270] - Speaker 1
That's the one that Uncle Jack highly favors from this list that I've been teaching about. But there's a lot. I think it's actually multifactorial.

[01:54:38.360] - Speaker 2
It's cumulative. Our kids are… They all operate on similar biological pathways, which is the connectivity between neurons that dies when your immune system is stressed and you have mitochondrial weaknesses. That's the linkage. Your immune system begins demanding energy, and your body gives that a precedence of your brain. And your brain, particularly for a kid, is the biggest demander of energy.

[01:55:07.640] - Speaker 1
It gets 20% of the cardiac output. In children, the cardiac output is even greater than it is in adults, which is the reason why they go through exorbitant growth. Because remember, humans are the silly-talking primates that aren't born with their brain fully developed until they're 25 years old.

[01:55:25.230] - Speaker 2
And then the vaccine schedule changed in '89. We During this period, we went from the three vaccines I got as a kid and you got to the 72 that our kids got. And 1989 was the big change here because '86 was when they passed the vaccine act and immunize the companies from liability. So suddenly, these companies made a gold rush because here's a product that, number one, the federal government pays for almost all the development costs. Number two, the The biggest cost to every medicine is downstream liabilities. Now, that's just been eliminated. Number three, there's no advertising and marketing costs because the government is forcing 76 million kids to take it. Number four, there's no safety testing. So vaccines are immune from pre-licensing safety testing, the only medical product, because it's essentially a military product.

[01:56:21.900] - Speaker 1
That's every single vaccine, Rick, just so you understand.

[01:56:24.410] - Speaker 2
There's not one of the 72 vaccines that was ever tested, pre-licensed. In placebo control trials.

[01:56:32.340] - Speaker 1
Including the one that we all just were forced to deal with.

[01:56:34.370] - Speaker 2
That was the best-tested one in history. So you ask, how am I going to fix this? I'm going to tell them, first of all, we're going to do the real science. I'm going to call in the journals and say to the Justice Department and say, we're going to file a racketeering against you for retracting these funny retractions.

[01:56:56.020] - Speaker 1
Just so you know, you know who made Rico stature, right? His dad. He's the That's the one that brought it in.

[01:57:01.880] - Speaker 2
But also, I'm going to say we're going to study chronic disease from now on, and we're going to find out what's causing it.

[01:57:08.730] - Speaker 1
So he's going to fund Doug Wallace's research. What is he saying? He's going to stop with the RNA-DNA, and let's We are looking at other places.

[01:57:16.550] - Speaker 2
Now you'll say, well, even if you find out for sure that a certain product is causal, these companies are so powerful and their lobby at Farm is the biggest lobbying companies in the world. And Let's say you find out the high fructose corn syrup is causing the obesity epidemic. Why is it when my uncle is present, 6% of American kids are obese, today, 42% are obese and 75% are overweight? How does that happen? The kids just suddenly get lazy. They're being poisoned. But you also understand high fructose corn syrup is a huge industry in this country. There's millions of farmers that are tied into it. There's an entire corn lobby. There's one of the most powerful lobbies on Capitol Hill. How do you fix that? Here's how you fix it. You do enough studies that the trial lawyers are going to be able to get into court, and they all start suing them, and the government doesn't have to do anything. It's just like we did with glyphosate. When we sued on glyphosate, which everybody said we couldn't do. We had enough studies to get past the Daubert hearing, which is the threshold. Then we sued them, and we made it too expensive, and they removed it for home gardening.

[01:58:29.710] - Speaker 3
But glyphosate is still being used for other things.

[01:58:32.570] - Speaker 2
Agriculture. We couldn't sue for agriculture because agricultural workers are exposed to so many pesticides. No way to figure it out. That it was impossible. Home gardeners, a lot of the Home gardeners, we were representing 40,000. They all said the same thing. I bought the glyphosate because it said safe as aspirin. It said it is safe. And it said, you don't even have to wear a moon suit. You can go out. The guy on the cover, we show to the jury, of the container is in Bermuda shirts and shorts, spraying glyphosate. They were telling them, this is so safe. You don't have to take any precautions. Then we show they knew that it was causing non-hogelism foment, all these people. They've removed it from there, but we couldn't sue for food because the agricultural workers have so many co-variables.

[01:59:28.470] - Speaker 3
It's still in the food?

[01:59:29.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's still on the food.

[01:59:32.550] - Speaker 3
Could it even be an organic food or no?

[01:59:35.250] - Speaker 2
What we found is that if you eat organic food, that all the glyphosate is gone in 75 days from your body.

[01:59:42.990] - Speaker 3
Considering that you're in probably the most well thought of democratic family in the history of the country, is it odd to be cast out by your party?

[01:59:54.310] - Speaker 2
Well, I feel like I fought as hard as I could to stay within a democratic party, but it became clear that I was not going to be allowed to compete or to run. The DNC has in its charter that it's supposed to be neutral. But what happened And what happened was, Rick, you remember in 2016, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was secretly helping Hillary against Bernie? Yes. And putting not only her finger, but her leg and a lot of other stuff on this scale to make sure that Bernie couldn't win. A group of Bernie supporters sued the DNZ after that election to say, Hey, it says in your charter you're not allowed to do that. This is like showing up at a football game and the referees are wearing your opponent's jerseys, right? And you're not allowed to do that. But the federal judge litigated stated that case. The federal judge said, Yeah, they did it. They fixed it, but they can do it. It's legal. They're a private club. They can make up their own rules. They can change them when they want, and they don't have to obey them. They can run it any way they want.

[02:01:14.220] - Speaker 2
It's a private up. So this time is really the first time where they've said, Oh, there is no boundaries to what we can get away with now. And so they came right out and they publicly versus Biden, and then they merged their campaigns. Biden and the DNC were indistinguishable. They were operating out of the same office. Dnc was fundraising, and they can break all the fundraising rules. They're not bound by the rules. I was of $6,600 maximum. They can get 700,000 from an individual and basically give it right to Biden's campaign. I was fighting this beamet, and then they were changing the rules. They changed the New Hampshire rules so that any vote I got in New Hampshire would count for President Biden, not for me. And the whole politicization and the weaponization that we've seen of the law enforcement agencies with them not giving me secret service protection We were seeing that on every level. The censorship that was being done of me in cooperation with the FBI and the CIA, this is all documented in Judge Doty's, 155-page federal decision that's now in the Supreme Court. And so it really became impossible for me to run in the Democratic Party.

[02:02:42.000] - Speaker 2
And then the media also, which is a line The media outlets like CNN, MSNBC, and New York Times that are completely aligned with the D&C. And there's a whole lot of Democrats who that's all they read, and that's all they see. And if you're living in that, If I was living in that information bubble, I would consider myself a very disreputable, crazy person because they never allowed an unfiltered interview with me on any of those outlets. And it was all just mischaracters of what I said or I supposedly said, and a stream of defamation. And I'm not complaining. I'm just answering your question. Is this... At some point, it became impossible for me to compete on those landscapes. And so it was an obvious choice that I had to make. And once I'm sure of a choice, I do it without regret.
