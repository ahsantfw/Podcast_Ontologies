[00:00:06.360] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. The interesting thing about the conversation is, I've written in every medium possible. I've typed. I've written longhand. But I met a woman, just once I met her, who was a court reporter. And I asked her if I sent her a dictation, if she would transcribe it into a screenplay, which I showed her what the form looked like. I never saw her again, but I basically dictated the script of the conversation and would send my dictation to her, and then she would transcribe it into a screenplay and That's how the screenplay came. That first draft was amazingly all just talked into a microphone.

[00:01:09.050] - Speaker 2
It's interesting, the form and content idea that it's so much about listening and so much about words And it's not about writing. It's about listening and speaking, really.

[00:01:20.110] - Speaker 1
Well, in truth, I didn't write it. I dictated it. I knew that dictation was a skill that everyone can talk, but I knew it was something you could learn how to do so that it came out what you were hoping. On the disk of the conversation, there is the actual screenplay, but that screenplay was dictated. The first screenplay, in other words, it wasn't made, corrected by the film. It was actually the film was really like that.

[00:01:55.380] - Speaker 2
How much effort went into that overheard conversation, which really plays throughout the movie. It gets revealed to us bit by bit over the movie. We hear most of it in the beginning, but then as the film goes on, we hear a few more phrases. It's a very simple conversation. Yes. Yet it says a lot.

[00:02:18.420] - Speaker 1
Well, it was my intention that the key phrase in it, which is he'd kill us if we had the chance, that it really be the same, but But in the end, we finally cheated, and we used the take where the inflection is slightly different. In other words, it's the difference between he'd kill us if we had the chance to... He'd kill us if he had the chance to... He'd kill us if he had the chance to... He'd kill us if he had the chance. Anyway, there was a slight inflection, but I really need to credit my editor and sound mixer and colleague, Walter Murch, who was really a Very important in the project because, of course, he is a sound genius. Number one, Walter Murch, I'm sure you may have heard of him. That was the first film he ever actually was the editor on. There was a second editor named Richard Chew, who was very good. But Walter was really almost like, worked as a co-director with me on the editing of the film, and his talent went through carefully every little beat of that movie, and then ultimately he did the final sound mix.

[00:03:34.350] - Speaker 1
A funny story I'll tell you, which you'll get a kick out of, is that when I was... Walter was a young USA student when I first met him, and I was trying to get him to work on the sound of our movies, and the unions wouldn't let him because he wasn't a union member. Finally, after going back and forth with the head of the union, they agreed he could work on it, but not if he had the word editor connected to his credit. So Walter said, Well, call me sound designer. And that's where the phrase sound designer came from, just a union squabble. And now you can't go see an opera or a play or a movie without there being a sound designer credit. So Walter invented that.

[00:04:16.620] - Speaker 2
How important is sound in a movie?

[00:04:19.410] - Speaker 1
Well, George Lucas, my young colleague, used to say, Sound and an image is fifty-fifty, but sound is much cheaper. So we We didn't have a lot of money in those days, so we always emphasize sound because we knew it had a big role to play in what the film was going to be like. But it was, sound is cheaper to get than pictures. We were up in San Francisco without resources. That's why the really contemporary movie Sound throughout the world came out of us, really, because we were in San Francisco where there was another company, wonderful company called Dolby Sound. They were based in San Francisco, and they were always super kind to us. We, of course, disclosed everything we were doing to them. Through Dolby, ultimately influenced movies throughout the world with five-point stereophonic sound and all of the what they call atmos. That's all because really, we were there with them as their colleagues, and we didn't have much money.

[00:05:30.260] - Speaker 2
It's really before that, there was just one big speaker behind the screen. Is that correct?

[00:05:34.170] - Speaker 1
Well, yeah. I mean, originally, there was just one big speaker. Then ultimately, much later, when home hi-fi became stereo, and then very often, there were two speakers. But the idea of five speakers, three in the front and two in the back, was way later and came from Dolby and from Zowertrobe, our company.

[00:05:56.400] - Speaker 2
Do you think of the conversation as a genre film?

[00:06:00.800] - Speaker 1
I'm uncomfortable with the idea of movies as genres. I mean, it's like, what genre is the Taj Mahal? What genre is Notre Dame? This thing to put everything in ratings and score them and give them like sports, have one win over another. Art is not like that, in my opinion. I remember when the New York Times started to give the movie review stars, and I was so offended. I said, this isn't sports. It's not like the dependent where the Yankees are in the lead and number two is number three. Art is not something that you can rate that way. I mean, you can like it or not like it, or you could think you have favorites and stuff. But to turn that into a rating system is offensive to me.

[00:07:00.990] - Speaker 2
Tell me about casting Jean Hackman.

[00:07:03.510] - Speaker 1
Originally, when I had written the script, I wrote the script before I made The Godfather. I was a theater student in the '50s, so that to a theater student, the Trinity was Marlon Brando, Tennessee Williams, and Eliah Kizan. They were the gods to me of cinema. Of course, I admired all three my whole life and still do. But But Brando was obviously an exceptional actor, and I dreamed of one day working with him, and I wrote the conversation with Brando in mind. Ultimately, when I managed, I never met him, of course, but I did get word back with him turning it down. And so then the conversation just went into repose for a while and the whole adventure that came up when they offered me the Godfather. And Why they offered me that? You have to realize that at the time there hadn't been a successful gangster movie for a while. Paramount got that novel, The Godfather, before it was published. They had bought it very inexpensively. They thought, well, maybe if they made it into a movie, they ought to make it with an Italian director. I mean, they offered it to important people.

[00:08:29.130] - Speaker 1
Everyone turned it down. So they decided that they should offer to an Italian-American, someone who was a screenwriter and someone who was young and cheap that they could tell what to do. And I happened to fit the bill on those two things. I was beginning to be a successful screenwriter. I had written a number of scripts professionally. And I was Italian-American, although my family were all musicians. I don't think I met ever a person who was a gangster as a kid. And I was young and married with two kids, so I could be pushed around because I... Except I didn't want to do the film. I felt... I don't know. Have you ever read the original novel, Rick?

[00:09:19.100] - Speaker 2
I never have.

[00:09:19.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's really the story that makes up the movie is like a sliver of a much longer book that's pretty salacious. And it It was written by the author who was a wonderful man and a talented writer. This particular book was written as a potboiler because he wanted to have some money so he could leave his kids some money. So We wrote this potboil and Paramount bought it. The first thing I said when I finally accepted it is that they wanted to shoot it in St. Louis and they wanted to shoot it In the period that was when we were shooting it, which was around 1973. You can figure that the reason they do that is so all the cars can just be the regular cars and all the hairstyles can be the regular hairstyles and all the clothes can be 1973 clothes. That's what they wanted to do. I said, well, I mean, the picture has to be shot in New York because that's where it's set. It has to be shot right after the war, 1945, because Michael has just come back from World War II. And so I was trying to be more faithful to what I thought was the essence.

[00:10:39.490] - Speaker 1
And they had planned to make the film in St. Louis, as I said, and they budgeted for like two, two and a half million dollars at that time to make it as cheap as possible. And my decision of saying, well, it had to be New York and it had to be period, the budget went from two and a half million dollars to six million. I was out. I mean, they wanted to fire me. Then when I came up with my casting, they basically had made a hit picture called Love Story with Ryan O'Neill and Ali McGraw, who later then married the head of the studio, Bob Evans. It sounds crazy to have Ryan O'Neill, who's a blonde guy, play a Sicilian. But in truth, there are blonde Sicilians with blue eyes because they came from France. There are Sicilians who look like Robert Redford, actually. So it's not inaccurate. But to think of a Sicilian as an Italian, I had met for another movie, a young actor named Al Pacino, who was dark and intense. And you know how when you read a book and you imagine someone in it, then it's fixed in your mind.

[00:11:54.900] - Speaker 1
I read it and imagined Al Pacino in it who was unknown. I had only met once because I was writing another thing that I didn't get to do. And he came to visit me and I met him. So I suggested Al Pacino for the part, and I eventually suggested for the Godfather part, Marlon Brando. And they hated those ideas. First of all, they thought, Al Pacino was a short, little runty guy. And Brando had just made actually quite a beautiful movie with Pantecorvo called Kouimata or Burn, but it was a huge flop financially, box off. But it was a very good movie. So they hated the Brando idea. They said, you're not even allowed to talk about that because also he was considered troublesome and someone that made things difficult. And Pacino, they kept referring to how short he was, I guess, because Bob Evans was a tall, good-looking guy. And so now, between my ideas for casting and the fact that now under me, the film was going to cost twice as much. I was really, I was positive I was going to get fired. I mean, it just seemed to me. And as I said, I had two kids and my wife was pregnant and I wasn't outgoing at Discatechs.

[00:13:15.800] - Speaker 1
I had a family that I had to take care of. So it turned out that I had also a year before written the script for Patty for 20th Century Fox. And it was on unusual script. It was very unusual, and I thought my producer liked it, but they hired Bert Lancaster to play Patty. I think they were flirting with the idea of William Wyler. I know they were flirting with the idea of the great American director and when I say great, I mean great, William Wyler, to direct it. Lancaster didn't like the script. He felt that... I started the movie with Patty and all of his rank and glory talking to the audience just as if he was in a theater with this unusual beginning. Lancaster, I guess maybe Weiler felt, Well, he worked his way up to that. That was not a good way to start. Anyway, I got fired and went off to San Francisco. So later on, we were renting an editing machine to Fox, and they said it doesn't work. Send a technician down there. I went down myself. I had no technician. But I saw it was George C. Scott doing Patty.

[00:14:30.860] - Speaker 1
What had happened, I didn't even know, was that Lancaster left and Wyler wasn't going to be involved. And they hired George C. Scott. He didn't like the Burt Lancaster script. So the head of the Story Department of Fox was a very nice man named David Brown. He said, we got this weird script that a young guy did. And it's interesting. So Scott liked it. And so that's how I discovered that my version of of Patty's script was done. So then we were coming up to the Academy Awards soon, right when I was going to get fired from the Godfather. And I was seeing the Oscars with my buddy, Marty Scorsese, who was part of the younger group that we were all friends. And I win the Oscar for Patty. And Marty said to me, he says, well, they're not going to fire you now for at least three or four months because it would be embarrassing. And it was true. So basically, Basically, I was going from section to section, always thinking I would get fired and then something would happen, I wouldn't get fired. But then I would get another distance. And that was really almost like the whole movie.

[00:15:44.430] - Speaker 1
Should I tell you how Brando got the part?

[00:15:46.190] - Speaker 2
Please, yes.

[00:15:47.290] - Speaker 1
Well, I was in a meeting with all of the heads of the company, including the President of Paramount, who was from a big filmmaking family. And we were sitting around the table and I said, let's get either Marlon Brando... We need a great actor for this part, so let's get either Marlon Brando or Lawrence Olivier. I realized Olivier is English, but he looks like a Mafia head. If you know the one named Vido Genovese, and he's good enough actor that he could do it, but he was too ill at the time, and he turned us down. I said, Then there's Marlon Brando. He's really only 47, but he's one of the great actors of the Arnold. And as I'm speaking, the head of the studio, the President, says, Francis, as President of Paramount Pictures, I'm telling you that Marlon Brando will never be in this picture, and you're no longer permitted to talk about it. And then I pretended I had a fit, and I just fell on the floor, and they all looked at me and I said, You're telling me I can't even talk about it? How can I direct the movie? I'm not even allowed to talk about it.

[00:17:00.140] - Speaker 1
And they said, okay, three conditions. Number one, Marlon Brando will shoot a screen test. Number two, he'll do the movie for nothing, free. Number three, he'll put up a million dollar bond to guarantee that he's not going to cause any trouble on the picture. And I said, okay, because I figured, at least now I could talk about it. You know what I mean? Of course, that was absurd. He's not going to put up a million dollars. Well, how do I do the screen test? So I contact Brando's representative and I said, I would imagine that Marlin might like to fool around with some just experiment a little and see if he can find a way to do the character. If he would, I would come over and work with him or suggest things. That's all I said. So I was told that, yes, you could come to his early in the morning. I did a little research, and I found out that Brando always wore earplugs because he didn't like loud, jarring noises. I got a friend of mine, a Ninja cameraman. I said, Let's all let... We're going to communicate just with hands. We're not going to talk or shout.

[00:18:18.960] - Speaker 1
It's going to be very quiet. I'm going to be quiet. We get there early in the morning. I remember there was a beautiful baby in the kitchen with a nanny, and we're all set up. And the door opens and out walks this man, beautiful man in a Chinese robe or Japanese robe with long blonde hair as Marlon Brando. When we look at him and he was so smart. He knew exactly what was going on. So the first thing he did is he walked over and got some shoe polish out of the thing and started to make his blonde hair black. And then he made it into a bun. And suddenly he started to have black hair. And then he put on, I bought a couple of shirts and I bought props. I bought Provoloni cheese. I bought the Italian cigaret. I figured he, I wouldn't really direct him. I would just put things near him and he could take them or not. And he went, I remember he went for a long time with his collar and he says, those guys, a collar is always just talking to himself. And then he says, he talked like, he looked like a bulldog and he takes some Kleenex and he stuffed it in his mouth.

[00:19:31.810] - Speaker 1
And then he says, he got shot in a threat. So he got to... Now, his phone rings. I mean, his real phone rings. He picks up the phone and he goes, I have no idea who was on the other line. But he started to turn into this character that he was inventing. And I'm shooting with a handy cam and my guys are shooting. It's amazing this transformation that he did. And he did it. I didn't do anything. I just put, when he took the Provoloni and he used the props, the cigari, did a thing. Now I know I got something great, but I knew these Guys, they're all so scared when you get into the intermediate management. The guy who owned and bought Paramount picture was a guy named Charlie Blue Horn. He was about a 56-year-old Viennese guy. He created the first conglomerate. He had a company called Gulf and Western. He would buy and sell auto parts, and he just made a fortune. And he bought Paramount. And he was accessible. You could talk to them. We all called them Charlie. So I decided I'm going to take my thing and fly on my own dime to New York and show the test to Charlie Blue Dorn, which I did.

[00:20:54.360] - Speaker 1
He was there in the Gulf and Western building, which is now a TrumpHours on Columbus Circle. I went into the Secretary and he said, Oh, is Mr. Blue Dorn? She said, Yes. Charlie comes, Francis, why are you doing here? I said, I want to show you something. He said, Hi, I'll come. One second. Down the hallway, he had a conference room. I set up for a Better Max or a videotape thing. When he came out, I turned it on, and he comes and looks, and there's Brando coming out in the Japanese robe with the thing, and he says, No, no, that's crazy. That's incredible. That's incredible. What do you have? It's amazing. Once I did that, he was in. Of course, they didn't talk about the million dollar guarantee. They did get him for scale, which he never was happy about. And that's how Brando got the part.

[00:21:57.190] - Speaker 2
Would you say he was washed up in Hollywood at that time?

[00:22:01.130] - Speaker 1
Well, at the time, he was washed up. He had made some flops, and he had been chastised for bad behavior, mutiny on the bounty and some pictures. I don't think he was... People are washed up, and then they're not washed up anymore. But at the moment of The Godfather, he was washed up.

[00:22:21.440] - Speaker 2
Had he not made The Godfather, had you not had the idea to get him and convince people for it to happen, I don't know that we would think of Marlon Brando in the same way. Not that he's not Marlon Brando, maybe the greatest actor of all time, but I don't know if that was his second act or his third act.

[00:22:39.880] - Speaker 1
Well, I personally, having experience with the guy now, I'm sure that something would have come along that he would have created something so spectacular that he would have, which he did with The Godfather, but he was a genius, not just as an actor, but what he used to talk about and how he used to think. It was very unusual. I mean, I met some incredible people. I'm now, what am I? I'm going to be 86 in a few months. I met Claude Renoir, and I met Marcel Duchamp, and I met all these incredible people. But Marlon Brando would be high up, and Kurosawa. Marlon Brando would be high up on my genius list.

[00:23:29.540] - Speaker 2
What was your relationship with Puzo like?

[00:23:32.180] - Speaker 1
Wonderful. He was like the uncle, your Italian uncle, and I adore it. That's why you notice with the godfather, it always says Mario Puzo's godfather. I'm the one who insisted that because I believe that who writes the original material should get the… This idea of a film by so and so is ridiculous. If it's an original screenplay, okay, a film by. But if someone else wrote the play or the novel… That's why all my films, it says, Bram Stoker's Dracula or John Grisham's The Rainmaker, Mario Puzo. He was a wonderful man. He was a character. He loved to gamble, and he was a terrible gambler. I had this nutty idea, let's go to a gambling casino in Reno and book ourselves into a suite in Reno because in a gambling casino, you can have breakfast at 4: 00 in the morning. You can have anything you want anytime. We He used to write through the night, and then he would like to go down and have a break and play roulette. He'd lose $1,000 in a half an hour, and then he would tell the people, Well, we're losing thousands down here, but we're making millions upstairs.

[00:24:49.660] - Speaker 1
We would go back up. But you could not love him, Mario Puzo. He was so sweet. He was great because I would write the drafts And he would, in long hair, put things. And I would have a line where Clemenza says, you got to make some spaghetti for your group. He says, first you brown some sausage. And Mario's note was, gangsters don't brown, they fry. But he was always making it better in his own way. He did write a book that is a really top, beautiful novel. Even Joseph Heller, who wrote Catch 22, was a friend his grief. But this Godfather was a potboiler. His other book, and the name will come to me, is a beautiful first-rate novel. He was a good writer.

[00:25:42.010] - Speaker 2
Do you think of yourself primarily as a writer or a director?

[00:25:46.030] - Speaker 1
My heart wishes I wanted to be a writer. I don't have the talent. I believe all of us human beings, I believe we're a genius species, and we all get talents. It's not always the talent we want, however. I didn't get the talent I want as a writer, but I got other things. I got a good imagination and I got a lot of energy, so I'm willing to rewrite the script 100 times if each time makes it 1% better. I have a weird talent for forecasting the future. We like a Cassandra. But there are directors who just see it, and that's a gift I have.

[00:26:31.340] - Speaker 2
Is the forecasting the future only as it relates to filmmaking or other things as well?

[00:26:36.930] - Speaker 1
It's come out more in filmmaking. Like I made the conversation 10 years before Watergate, or I made my film about basically women's liberation 12 years before the women's movement, which came out of the political. And even Megalopolis, which is America as Rome, America just basically He elected someone, Sola or somebody. My films do have a prophecy element in them. I don't know where it comes from.

[00:27:12.990] - Speaker 2
It's unintentional, but it has come to be the case.

[00:27:16.000] - Speaker 1
Several times already. But I was a theater student as a kid. I was like... Did you ever see the movie called Rushmore that Wes Anderson made? Of course. Yeah, I was like that kid in Rushmore. In fact, that's my nephew, Jason Trussman. Fantastic. Wonderful boy, wonderful kid.

[00:27:36.880] - Speaker 2
How different is the word on the page in the script to the movie? How different are those two things?

[00:27:43.880] - Speaker 1
Well, if you a script, which I'm sure you have, you see how it's broken down. It's basically like a short story. The script is broken down with a lot of exterior, anterior, and describing what is be going on. That whole format is really not done for creative reasons. That's done so that's easily budgeted. They want to know how many days and nights, how many nights. The whole format is that. The movie is basically what you see and what you hear. And that's how they broke up the script so that when you read a screenplay, ignore all that exterior, interior, medium shot That's all for the guy to budget it. Just think of it in terms of like it's telling you what you're going to hear and what you're going to see. One of the interesting things, Rick, is that because a cinema got invented, cinema got invented first before, I mean, the moving picture before television. And that was an accident because what was going on in that period when the motion picture was invented, there was also television was being worked on. And it could have been one could have happened first. It just so happened that the motion picture camera, which was silent and black and white at first, happened first.

[00:29:12.900] - Speaker 1
And because it happened first, these brilliant originators of movies worked in a way that had never existed before, which was telling stories with pictures. Of course, pictures had told stories. The great artist, W. Marnell, said, Sound had to come, but it came too soon. And what he meant was that they were really inventing a new way to do drama through just images without sound. Once sound came, it just stopped the whole thing, and they went back making hokey plays, old-fashioned plays. So this wonderful accident that silent movies were invented for... If television had been invented first, who knows? I mean, television later, when it was invented, benefited from copying what movies were like. But movies wouldn't have been like that if they had sound. So it was a great gift. And then, of course, sound came about around 1929. And intimately, I don't know if you know this, but my grandfather, Augustino Coppola, who was a great tool and die maker machinist, was hired by a company in Fort Lee to make the Vitaphone. And I have a picture of him. I'll get her for you. So my family, the Coppola family, being in that he made the machine that did the jazz singer with Al Jolson.

[00:30:41.510] - Speaker 1
And my other grandfather, my mother's side, owned a movie theater and was importing silent movies for Italian immigrants. Our family is five generations in the movie business. My granddaughter, Gia, made a movie called The Last Showgirl, She is the fifth generation of our family in the movie business. It's incredible. It's amazing.

[00:31:07.780] - Speaker 2
What's the relationship between painting and film?

[00:31:12.810] - Speaker 1
Did you see Megalopolis? I did. Okay. You know, Megalopolis takes the position that all artists control time and that a painter is freezing a moment of time, or as Gertas says, architecture's frozen music, It's where it dances time and space. So we control time. Artists control time. And so a painting is a movie, but frozen in one moment of time.

[00:31:40.500] - Speaker 2
It's a beautiful idea. The artist freezing a moment in time. It's a powerful way to live with that understanding. The reason I wanted to talk about the conversation first was I originally saw it in film school 40 years ago, and I watched it again this week, having not seen it in 40 years. And I feel like I remembered every single image from 40 years ago. That's not typical for me. Usually, you'll remember the story, but I didn't really remember the story, but I remembered the images. Interesting. Yeah, again, can't explain it, but it was an interesting experience. I've seen this. I remember this. I remember how he was sitting when he was playing the saxophone. I remember the speaker sitting next to him. I remember what the apartment it look like when he tore it apart. It's interesting how certain images stick in our mind in almost a dream-like way. Again, I didn't remember the meanings of these images, just the power of the frame.

[00:32:47.630] - Speaker 1
Let me ask you a question. Did you ever see a movie I made? It was a flop called Rumbelfish.

[00:32:54.660] - Speaker 2
I've never seen Rumbelfish, but I know a little bit about it. It's black and white, yes.

[00:32:58.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and I might I mentioned making it was I wanted to make an art film for kids, and I did. My deal always was that if the movie covers whatever the finance was, then I own it. And Rugglefish didn't cover it, so I don't own it. I was sad about it because I love it. It has Mickey Rork is in it. But interestingly, when it played in Latin America, somehow, for some reason, I can't explained, it just stuck. And there was a theater in Chilly somewhere that just showed it for a year. And a whole generation of South American novelists and filmmakers all were weaned on Rumbelfish, which I didn't even know what it was. In fact, one of them came back to Tulsa where it was shot and made a film called Searching for Rusty James, which was the character there. It turns out that my greatest dream had come true. To me, the The greatest award you get is not a big check. It's not a stupid statue of this or that. It's when a young person comes who made a film, says, I became a filmmaker because I saw your film. Because I made a film, I told you, I made because I saw Antonioni's film or because I saw Stanley Kupbert's film or because I saw Orson Welles' film.

[00:34:23.520] - Speaker 1
That's why I did it. There's a movie. Have you heard of a film just came out called Quiet on the Western Front with a director named Edward Berger? He made the film of Salvation about the popes. But this is a heavyweight filmmaker. He comes, he says he wants to meet me. I said, Gee, I love it. I know your film, All Quiet in the Western Front, is wonderful. That's the remark book. He said, well, I didn't know anything about movies, but when I saw Apocalypse Now, I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker. That, to me, is joy. That's all I... Because that's what it's about. It's about we're on the shoulders of the people who came before and we were passing it into the future that way. That's what the apprenticeship system is. The fact that you could have made somebody so important want to make films, that's a gift.

[00:35:27.540] - Speaker 2
What motivated you to go to film school?

[00:35:30.420] - Speaker 1
I was a theater major, as I told you, and I was really successful. I was not successful in anything, but in my college career, I became the big bench in the film department. I had all the keys and I had a lot of clout, but I had no money and no girlfriend. I was hanging around on the campus waiting for rehearsal that night. There was a little building we called the Little Theater, and it had a poster on it. It said, Today, four o'clock, Serge Eisenstein film 10 Days That Shook the World, October. I had nothing to do. I went in there, about four or five people in there, and there was It was a silent film, but there was no music. In other words, they didn't play a piano score or something. It was just silent. I saw October, 10 Days That Shook the World, which is a long film. I came out and I said, Wow, I'm not going to be a director and go to Yale drama school. I'm going to be a filmmaker like that. I decided to go instead of... I was going to go to Yale, to the famous Yale drama school.

[00:36:40.080] - Speaker 1
Instead, I went to UCLA because in those days, if you could show residency, college was free.

[00:36:47.760] - Speaker 2
Was film a small industry at that time?

[00:36:49.540] - Speaker 1
No, there was Hollywood, but no one had ever gone from film school to make Hollywood films. There were only a few film school. There was USC, and they were considered more tactical, so they made documentaries and tactical films. There was UCLA, and then there was NYU and CCNY. There were about five film schools in the country. And UCLA was the ARDI one. And so I went to UCLA and it was occupied during World War II. At UCLA, there were bungalows near Sunset Boulevard that were built by the army and had some purpose that wasn't part of the school. Then it got absorbed by the school. And that was the movie department. The students were pretty much 100% men, except for maybe just a few. I remember I was amazed when I went because one of the new students was a Swedish woman named Ingrid Thuleen, who had been a star in Bergman films, and she went to UCLA to become a director. This got Burgman's there, and there were two or three other girls. I was there in this new crop. I was the only one who had come from theater. In fairness, I noticed that movie directors who don't come from theater or who were not ex-actors tend to not know a lot about acting, which is interesting because obviously the two most important things of movies the essential, the oxygen and hydrogen is writing and acting.

[00:38:33.990] - Speaker 1
I mean, you can have... If you have good writing and acting, you can have terrible photography, terrible music score, terrible sound effects, terrible everything. The movie can still be good. But if you don't have good acting or writing, you can have the greatest score, you can have the greatest photography, and it's not that the movie can't possibly be good. So I knew that from my theater background. And there were a lot of older guys who were more senior in the UCL Film School, and there was limited equipment, like an editing machine, for example. They would take the editing machine and lock it in their editing room. So they always had it. And the new Then you had to scrounge to get an editing machine. Whereas theater, my experience with theater was a group experience. You all worked together, and then you went and had pizza together, and you had a crush on some girl that you didn't tell her you had a crush on. In It was the opposite in movies. Everyone was a loner. Everyone was alone with their editing machine. In fact, my company, American Zoetrope, was basically introducing a more theater culture to film.

[00:39:43.880] - Speaker 1
In our company, all the film, we all were together and we would go eat together and we would help each other on each other's films, which is what my generation of filmmakers are still like. You never hear someone in my generation, my colleagues say a bad thing about another director in that. There's a colleagueship that's really nice.

[00:40:07.920] - Speaker 2
Who were the other young directors in your group?

[00:40:12.320] - Speaker 1
Well, there was a brilliant director named Carroll Ballard. He made later the film The Black Stalion and Flyaway Home. There was a very crazy, but in his own way, brilliant character named Dennis Jacob. There was a The only one who made it a teeny bit in the movie, other than Carol Ballard, who over time is greatly appreciated, there was a guy named Noel Black, who was a very nice gentleman, and he had a little bit of a career. Other than that, my generation, there's me, in a way.

[00:40:54.200] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of Zoetrope. What did you envision?

[00:40:57.790] - Speaker 1
I'm about five years older than these colleagues. So George Lucas is about five years younger than me, except for Carroll Ballard. He's four years older than me. But pretty much everyone, even Marty, is about probably five years younger. They're all about four or five years in John Millius. And what happened was I won what was called the UCLA, the Goldman Award, and that was like the Nobel Prize to UCLA writers, mostly novelists. I was the first screenplay ever to win Goldman Award was $2,000, and I was living on a dollar a day. So it was a lot of money. And it was also immediately, since it was a screenplay that won, every agent in town wanted to represent me to be a screenwriter. And I got a job as a screenwriter working for a company, the famous man named Ray Stark. And I had been an assistant also to Roger Corman when I was poor. I learned a lot about filmmaking from Roger Corman. At any rate, one thing had led to another, and I was now directing a Hollywood picture. I was 25. I had two kids, and I was directing a movie called Finnegan's Rainbow at Warner Brothers, starring Fred Astaire as an older man, but he was a wonderful person.

[00:42:22.830] - Speaker 1
And a young woman named Pachula Clark. And then an English-Oh, she's great. Yeah. Great singer. She was a wonderful singer and a sweet lady. And then a crazy English guy named Tommy Steel. But it was a really cheap movie. It was like less than $2 million. I wanted to shoot it in a real Kentucky where there really were people in the tobacco business, but I had to shoot it on the old sets of Camelot and all phony sets. I hated it. Anyway, one day I'm shooting, and in those days, the whole crew were grown up adults wearing suits the ties, even the crew were like that. I look on my left and there's this skinny kid watching. At one point, I went over to him and I said, What are you looking at? He said, Not much. I said, Well, okay, what are you doing? He said, Well, I want a scholarship to observe what's going on at Water Brothers, and this is what's going on, but I'm really going to go to the animation department and Hannah or were there or something. So I said, well, tell you what, because I liked having a young person.

[00:43:35.470] - Speaker 1
I was there with all these older men. I tell you what, why don't you come here every day and you can come and watch here? All you have to do is one thing. He says, what? I said, you have to just come up with a great idea every day. And he did. And that was George Lucas.

[00:43:53.850] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:43:54.850] - Speaker 1
He was so bright, and I knew it. So finally, I said, I mean, you know, George, I have another movie that I want to make going across the country in a small little van with the editor and everything and shoot whatever happens, incorporate it into the script. And it's called The Rain People. If you come with me and we'll do it together, then the next film I'll do will be one you want to make. So he said, great. So I made this film called The Rain People, even before the edit of Finnegan's Rainbow was done. I mean, I had left when I wanted, but I wanted to get out of there. And we had two little vans and another van with the editing machine, and we were in a position. We had a script. It was about a woman who leaves her husband. She loves him, but she doesn't want to be a wife and goes on the road. The idea is that we could make it, but if something's happening, if there's an emergency, we could go 300 miles out of way and incorporate it into it. It was another It was a slightly different filmmaking.

[00:45:02.510] - Speaker 1
When I went to college, there was a football player that we all loved, whose name was Killer Kelly. And Killer Kelly had been so banged up that he had a metal plate in his head and he was like a child. And the college just hired him to rake leaves. And I always used to see him. And my heart went out to this big man who was like a kid. And eventually, I heard that they He saved killer Kelly like a thousand dollars and basically said goodbye. So I met this young guy, I like an actor named Jimmy Khan, and I told him the story. And my idea was that there's a guy, he's hitchhiking, and that this housewife picks him up. Maybe she wants to have an affair, I don't know. But she becomes saddled with this person dependent on her. And that was what the story... But my idea was that we could go anywhere we wanted to. There was a mine disaster in Virginia. We went there and incorporated that, or there was a parade in Memphis, and he wandered through the break. So it was a style of filmmaking. So George and I did that, but Essentially, we had a whole film company.

[00:46:17.580] - Speaker 1
We had all the equipment, we had all the people, and we ended up doing the final scenes in Kansas, I think. I forget the town. But the town fathers of Kansas If you guys stay here, we'll get you a studio. But we realized we were a mobile film company. One thing led to another. And George was from Modesto. So to him, San Francisco was the big city. And I wanted to get out of LA because I wanted that control that was on the movie business to go away. So we decided to take the whole unit and just... I had a house, a summer house. I sold them and we made a a studio of sorts with a sound and everything in San Francisco, and that was Americans. And then George wanted to call it the Transamerican Spracketworks. And I had visited, when I bought the equipment, a Danish company called Lanternafilm. I wanted to call it American Lantern or Magic Lantern. And eventually we went back and forth and we called that American Zotrup. The idea was it was this group of filmmakers. It wasn't just me making the film. It was George was going to make one, John Milius was going to make one, a man named John Cordy.

[00:47:43.910] - Speaker 1
Did you ever hear of John Cordy? K-o-r-t-y. He was an important filmmaker in San Francisco. That's how it happened.

[00:47:53.790] - Speaker 2
When you were 25 years old and directing your film, were there many other 25-year-old directors who came from film school at that time? Was that a real thing?

[00:48:05.530] - Speaker 1
There was one who was someone I admired immensely, who was young, who had directed the Sonny and Shera movie, and he was from Chicago. He didn't really come from a film school, but he really impressed me. We were always up for the same thing, but we were good friends. His name was Billy Friedken. He had made a film that I thought was the highest thing you could do. He made a film, The People versus Paul Crump. Did you ever hear that movie?

[00:48:36.860] - Speaker 2
I'm not.

[00:48:37.480] - Speaker 1
It was a black guy was going to be executed for murder in Chicago and was not guilty. I mean, this is the gist of it. And Billy made a film about it called The People versus Paul Crump. It was so effective that he got pardoned or he didn't get killed. And I said, if you can make a film that saved somebody's life, my hats off to you. That was Billy Friedkin, who later made The Exorcist and the Sauceror and the French Connection.

[00:49:14.410] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Did you become friends at that time?

[00:49:16.430] - Speaker 1
Very good friend. But he was much hipper than I was. I was married with three kids, and he was more adventurous. He was an incredible character. He married Jean Moreau for a while.

[00:49:30.860] - Speaker 2
Wow. Typically at that time, the directors would have been people who had done other jobs on the set and worked their way up and were maybe 50 or 60 years old, I imagine.

[00:49:41.430] - Speaker 1
Yes, but there were some directors who were more interesting than that. There was another company, I forget, which was basically the offspring of studio executives. They had a lot of ins. But how Phil Ashby was a director who had been an editor who was very advanced, and he made some wonderful films. That's when a lot of the Corman people I knew co... Like Nicholson was always in the Corman pictures, but he became very important. And Dennis Hopper, who later was in my apocalypse. Dennis Hopper was a handful. He was amazing. He was in Rumbelfish.

[00:50:25.820] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Roger Corman and that whole world, the Corman world.

[00:50:29.840] - Speaker 1
The The Common World was before all this happened. I was very poor film student, and I was living in a tiny little place. I had gone to military school for a while. In fact, the same military school that Donald Trump went to, New York Military Academy. I ran away. I went AWAL and didn't want to stay there. My father never forgave me for that because he had borrowed the money on one of those deals where to pay, and he still had to pay even though I wasn't there. He said, I'm going to have nothing to do with your college. I had about a dollar 25 a day to live on besides this little hovel I lived in. That meant I had 25 cents for breakfast, 50 cents for lunch, and then I would eat Kraft macaroni and cheese dinners every night because that was it. I was extremely poor. But there were some fabulous faculty members. One was a woman, my directing teacher, who was a famous woman, really, named Dorothy Arsner. Have you ever heard of her? She was the only woman director in Hollywood in the '30s and '40s. She directed Crawford and She was a great director.

[00:51:47.270] - Speaker 1
She was a woman. She was my director here. I mean, everyone at UCLA so respected her. To this day, I will not refer to her as anything but Ms. Arsner because she was so fabulous. I noticed on the bulletin board, I was looking for some way to make some money. That night, I was a bus boy at Kalbault's restaurant. The things said, call this number were an assistant of Roger Corman. Some knowledge of Russian will be helpful. I saw October, 10 Days Shook the World. That was my knowledge of Russia. I said, I called up and they said, We'll call you back and let you know if you get an appointment. Well, I hadn't paid my phone bill, so I didn't know. I was just in horror that I would get this call, but the phone wouldn't go through. Ultimately, I did get the call and I went And it was a very bright woman, so she hired me. The job was to take this Russian movie he had bought. The Russian movie was very idealistic. In other words, it showed the cosmonaut sees the golden cosmonaut of hope for the future. Roger said, what I was told through this woman, who was my boss, to take out all of the golden hope stuff and cut in monsters that they see.

[00:53:14.120] - Speaker 1
And he said, they wanted He wanted a monster that looked like a great female organ, and ultimately the male organ gets swallowed by it. My job was to do this. I was in every day. I couldn't speak Russian. I was Writing a new to loop it into English. But I would get there very early and slump myself over the movieola. When she and Roger came in, they would see like I had been there all night, which I hadn't. So ultimately, I did this ridiculous job, and it was released as Battle Beyond the Sun or something. Ultimately, she gave me her thumbs up, and Roger offered me to be his assistant. And he offered me, I think, $75 a week. When I complained, he said, When he had an assistant job, he got $40 a week. At any rate, I became his assistant, and that meant basically I had to wash his car. He had a lawn with sod. I had to move the sod. But finally, he was going to make a movie with Vincent Price. Of course, I knew who Vincent Price was. And what he did is the company making the movie, he had them hire me.

[00:54:31.690] - Speaker 1
I was on this payroll of this this AIP studio, but I would work as the dialog director. In other words, I would run the lines with Vincent Price and these other actors who were in it. But I was a theater student, so he said, well, you can stage it if you want. He would shoot seven pages a day. I mean, he just would go through it. I was there ahead of him with Vincent Price, reading the lines and then setting up, and then they would shoot it, which was incredible. But at 12: 30, they all broke for lunch. I had to then go back and be his assistant. In other words, what he had done is he had them pay me, but he then got me being his in for free. At one point, he said to me, Do you know anyone who knows how to do sound? And I said, of course, I know how to do sound because he was going to make a picture in Europe, and he wanted to take someone there to be the sound guy. Also, if someone went on one of those trips for Roger, if the person bought a car, in those days, we used to buy cars, you buy a Volkswagen in Germany, it was cheaper.

[00:55:43.800] - Speaker 1
If you bought a car and you agreed to take the people around on the film in the car, he'd give you $300. Well, that's when I won the golden car. I had $2,000. I bought an Alfa Romeo sports car and picked it up and in Europe. But of course, Roger didn't like it because I could only take one person. I was hoping I'd get a girl. But instead, I took one of the Israeli guys, this guy named Yosky Gross, his name. He was a great big guy from Israel, and he was the cousin of another Israeli guy named Monacham Golen. This Joseph Gross was wonderful. He said, I know you're unhappy to have me in the car, but we'll have fun. I'll tell you a few jokes. You'll love it. And he was right. And we were driving. So I drove all around with Yosky and Gross. Bottom line is that everyone knew that Roger, after the company made a film, would use all the stuff paid for and make another film for himself. But he was called back to make a film called The Raven with Peter Lorrie and Vincent Price. So we all knew that there was this whole unit that he would probably could sell him on making a picture.

[00:57:03.550] - Speaker 1
In those days, Psycho had just come out. So I just wrote one page. I wrote the key scene of a Psycho movie. Everyone wanted to get the job, but basically, Roger chose mine and sent me, said, okay, can you do this? I'll give you $20,000 to make this. I mean, not give me the budget, $20,000 to make the film. And I'll send this lady with you is because I'm going to put the money in two names for cosigners, and I suggest you make it in Ireland because they all speak English. I take my Alfa Romeo and I go to Ireland, and I go to where there's this little studio in a place called County Wicklow, and I meet an English guy there, and he says, What are you doing? I said, I'm making a movie for Roger Corman. He says, Well, what's it about? I said, Well, here's the one page. I haven't written the script yet. He said, Tell you what, I'll want to buy the English rights. And he said, What do you want for them? And I said, $20,000. So now I had $40,000. So when I told Roger about it, he said, well, send me the $20,000 back.

[00:58:17.430] - Speaker 1
And he wanted to own the picture for free. Instead, what I did is I told the lady he had said, We got to deposit this check in the bank account, cosign it. And I put the whole $40,000 a bank under only my name. And I made the movie for $40,000. So Roger was plenty pissed off. But then when he saw it, he more or less liked it. And that was a film that he called Dementia 13, which was technically the first real film I ever made. And you know who loves that film? Who's the great writer who writes scary stuff? Stephen King. That was one of his favorite movies, Dementia 13.

[00:58:59.920] - Speaker 2
Do you remember when you first saw Psycho? Did it feel like a different movie when you saw it?

[00:59:05.850] - Speaker 1
Oh, I thought it was scared the hell out of me. I mean, it really were. I mean, Hitchcock never had great acting in his films, but Psycho, worked like dingbusters. Then Vertigo. I mean, Vertigo, I thought was incredible when I was a kid. But the best acting in a Hitchcock film is Stranger's on a Train or The Wrong Man.

[00:59:29.510] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Vincent Price.

[00:59:34.270] - Speaker 1
He was a wonderful man. He was really just like what you imagine, a great thespian. I had seen him in a favorite film of mine and my big brother, who was an important figure in my life. Did you ever see a movie with Vincent Price called The Baron of Arizona?

[00:59:55.170] - Speaker 2
I've not.

[00:59:55.690] - Speaker 1
Oh, it's Samuel Fuller. It's great. But I loved Vincent Price from The Baron of Arizona. So I was in awe of him. He was a wonderful man. He had been in a film that he was great in called Shampagne for Caesar. I remember that I saw when I was a kid. I always remembered this character that Vincent Price played. My brother used to take me in the movie, so I loved people like Vincent Price and all the Coda films made in England, Four Feathers and the Red Shoes Bruce and Black Narcissus. Unb believable. Yeah, fantastic. Michael Powell films.

[01:00:35.500] - Speaker 2
You described Making the Rain People. How different was that than what other people were doing in terms of making movies at that time?

[01:00:45.470] - Speaker 1
It was quite different. We were a mobile unit and we were incorporating and I was rewriting and we were editing as we were going the story as it came along. And Originally, I had a part for an actor named Rip Torn. You remember Rip Torn?

[01:01:06.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, fantastic.

[01:01:07.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah, he was great. He was in my film with Geraldine Page on your big, my first movie that I made. I had made a deal with Rip Torn to be this motorcycle cop in the movie that she has a fling with, it doesn't quite work out. And Riptorne was telling me that he was a character and he wanted me to buy him a motorcycle and then he would do it. So then I would buy, I bought him the motorcycle, but it was stolen. So he said, well, you've got to replace it. So I bought a used motorcycle and he got all upset about it. In the end, in the last minute, he bails on me. I have no one and I have the part. So Jimmy Khan tells me about a guy he worked with in an Altman film named Robert Duval. And the last minute I'm able to Bobby DuVal to be the motorcycle cop in the Rainbow. By the way, George Lucas also shot a 16-millimeter documentary about the homemaking of the Rain people called Filmmaker, which you can get.

[01:02:13.890] - Speaker 2
Would you recommend to anyone who wanted to be a director to study theater first, learn about acting?

[01:02:21.860] - Speaker 1
Without a doubt. Not only that, I tried to get every film school I ever visit to have first year directing students not make short films, but do one-act plays. Because if they do one-act plays, they get to see the result in front of an audience right away. If they make a short film, they get bogged down in postproduction and end up not seeing the short film for eight months, and they don't benefit from seeing how an audience react. Also, in theater, you learn about acting, and in film school, you don't learn about acting. In fact, traditionally, every school, every university that has a theater department and a cinema department, they don't get along. They don't work together. Even in Poland or in some other country, there's a natural disassociation, and it's cultural. It's that the cinema people think the theater people are phoneies. It's, Oh, darling. It's a funny thing. I really worked hard at UCLA recently to bring the cinema and film people together with some degree of success.

[01:03:32.220] - Speaker 2
It's a great idea. I imagine even learning about cinema probably would make the theater better as well.

[01:03:38.940] - Speaker 1
No question. Cinema is the child of theater, and it goes back to the Greeks and perhaps before the Greeks. There's so much to learn that we hand down. But it's funny. Also, you think that the cinema students would welcome having some actors for their films. And I know so few cases of where a good actress from the UCLA Film School worked with a filmmaker, but they got married. That was Caleb Deschanel, a wonderful cinematographer from USA, and his wife, Mary Joe, was in the theater Department.

[01:04:20.810] - Speaker 2
When you moved Zoetrope to San Francisco after the Rain people, tell me about setting up shop and tell me what happened next with Zoetrope. What was the vision it and what happened?

[01:04:31.010] - Speaker 1
We didn't quite get what we really wanted. I had wanted... My idea was to buy, with a mortgage, of course, a big white elephant mansion. Reason is that all those bedrooms and things are perfect. I saw a place in Denmark like that that was right on the water. And it was this wonderful film company called Lanternafilm. It was all kids working together, boys and girls, editing and stuff. And a big mansion is perfect. All the facilities in there. And then sometimes they even had something related to an entertaining room that you could shoot in. So we were looking for old broken down mansions that we couldn't find anywhere. They wouldn't sell it to us. We had a lot of problem being vetted. And so finally, there was a south of, you know San Francisco at all? A little bit. In those days, south of Market Street, there was the south of Market Street area, which was a little seedier. And there were some warehouses. And there was a record company that was there on Walsum Street, and they were looking for someone to share the lease. And I made a deal where we would have a place for our truck to come in and all our equipment.

[01:05:54.230] - Speaker 1
Then we had a big area where we built the screening room and a mixing studio. We could It was this whole area, and we had offices, and George liked it, but he really had bought the idea of being in the country and having it more in there. He was never 100% comfortable in this more. And I viewed it as a temporary thing that if we were more successful, that someday we would be able to buy some place. So it was like that for about a year and a half. And And basically, we just went broke. Like I was offered the godfather. I bought for myself a little house with my wife and then two children, my pregnant wife and two children. And George wasn't comfortable He wanted to be somewhere. And so we got a place in Mill Valley, and George liked that. And so we had a Mill Valley annex. When he made American Graffity, of course, that made money. So finally, George had money. And then ultimately, he bought a property in a place, ironically called Lucas Valley. But he got a kick out of it. It was Lucas Valley before he bought it.

[01:07:12.180] - Speaker 1
And he built his Skywalker Ranch there And then he started becoming really successful, more commercially than me by far.

[01:07:21.160] - Speaker 2
What was your involvement in American graffiti?

[01:07:24.210] - Speaker 1
Well, I was important. He couldn't get it off the ground without me. And I really liked the script. In fact, I had made The Godfather by then, and I had enough money. American Graffity was going to cost $700,000. And I went to the bank and I asked if I had enough my Godfather credits, could I have $700,000? And it was my wife who said to me, you know, Francis, someday, you could certainly finance a film, but it should be your own film. And that and the bank said, I'll I'll give you the $700,000, but I want you to wait for a few days because we had a client who financed his own movie and lost it all. So basically, we got Universal to put up the money and And they required that I be involved in it. And I was helpful on Graffedia. I helped with the casting because George didn't really know all those actors. And that was done by my associate, Fred Ruce, and it was wonderfully cast. And he was shooting without a cinematographer at all. They were just shooting. And I went to his friend who liked him and got Casco Wexler to come on American Groovy.

[01:08:45.460] - Speaker 1
So I was there as the big brother.

[01:08:48.840] - Speaker 2
Were the songs written into the script?

[01:08:51.190] - Speaker 1
That was his idea. It was the first time that the score of a movie, yes, he had picked all those songs. And I remember we got all of those songs for $140,000. Today, you can't get one song for $140,000. He did many unusual things. Number one, he had the first score that was all basically rock and roll, and he He's the first person at the end of the movie, when the movie ends, there's like four lines about the main characters, that so and so went and did this, so and so went to the Vietnamese War. That was George's all his innovation. No one had ever done it before. When we showed the film, previewed to Universal, Universal sent up some executives and they saw the preview, and when it was over, they said, Well, we're very disappointed. We really think it needs a lot of And I said to them, I said, Are you kidding? I said, They loved it. I said, You had to get on your knees and thank this young man for saving your job. Because if you don't want it, I'll buy the film for you right now. Because I did have the ability to do it, even though my wife is, I wish I had.

[01:10:04.980] - Speaker 1
I don't. I don't. Because my philosophy is you win a few, you lose a few. It all comes out the same.

[01:10:11.160] - Speaker 2
That movie really impacted that music as well. The whole revival of '50s music really began with that movie. To this day, you can hear a radio station that plays music from the '50s. That was not the case before that Well, there was a great line in it that he had that George wrote, which is, Rock and roll went downhill ever since Buddy Holly died. Tell me about John Millius.

[01:10:40.610] - Speaker 1
He was extraordinary. The USC guys all had special. Walter Murch was Sound. Keel De Chanel was photography. George was everything. And John Millius was their writer. And he was this flamboyant guy who just It just tumbled out of him. You know what happened to him? You don't know what happened to him? Uh-uh. Tragically, about eight years ago, he was on a blood thinner. His girlfriend said, Oh, that blood thinner stuff is nonsense. I think you should just drink certain milk product. She interfered and she stopped him from taking it. He had a stroke, and now he can't speak anymore. And then he has, fortunately, he has a, I mean, he is heartbreak. He has to write on a slate, but he's got a young lady who really takes care of him and loves him. I mean, his head works, I know, but he just can't... It's a stroke.

[01:11:47.520] - Speaker 2
Did he write the original script for Apocalypse Now?

[01:11:50.690] - Speaker 1
Totally. It's mostly his script. What I did is I had a copy of Heart of Darkness with me, and he'd Between the script, I would use my underlying copy of Heart of Darkness to do it. In fact, like the Dennis Hopper character in the movie, he wasn't in the script at all. But when I saw how wired Dennis Hopper was I invented... There was a character in Hard Darkness called the Russian who's like the sayer of Kurtz, the Prophet or whatever. I invented that character with Dennis Hopper right during the movie, and that You remember the Dennis Hopper part in Apocalypse? Yeah, of course. That didn't exist. That was out of the book. But even the music that people think of my family as a classical musician, it was my idea to play Wagner through the attack. That was John Milias' idea.

[01:12:48.410] - Speaker 2
There's a story that you shot for several weeks and then took a break and went back to San Francisco and then rethought the film during that break. Is that what happened?

[01:13:00.000] - Speaker 1
Not exactly. What happened is when we were casting, some of the people I liked weren't available. My best bet was Harvey Keitel, who's a great actor. But Harvey Keitel is in a school of acting that is very active. De Niro does it, too. But in other words, it's not a reflective guy looking, it's a guy being active. When we actually started shooting, I felt was wrong. I haven't done this many times. And that's the worst thing you could do is to change an actor that you start. But I really felt it was wrong. And now weeks had gone by. I mean, it was my neck. The debt was all mine. In those days, interest was 21 %. So I was scared, and I felt I had to make that decision. And nothing against Harvey Keitel. He's a wonderful actor, but he felt it It was that type of in your face that he's good at that this wasn't going to be that. Marty Sheen had tried out for it, but he wasn't available. But by the time this happened, I went back and met people, and Martin Sheen was available, and I made the decision.

[01:14:20.580] - Speaker 1
Then when I did have Martin Sheen, who had a nice face and was someone that could be someone just watching, then I felt I needed something early in the picture to show what a complex human being he was. I invented that scene where he looks at himself in the mirror and smashes, and he's totally, obviously, a weird guy. So that throughout the movie, when you see him looking at the jungle and stuff, you know that this is a person that's not just a regular, simple person.

[01:14:56.870] - Speaker 2
How often do things happen or come up during the process of making something where you realize there's an opportunity to do something that wasn't planned that's actually better than what was planned?

[01:15:10.330] - Speaker 1
Well, obviously, there are many, many film directors film artists, I would call. Therefore, there are many different methods. I mean, Hitchcock's method was one that was very controlled. He was a brilliant artist. He could make storyboards, as it were. He could design the film and then do it just like he designed it. With every filmmaker, there's the potential of another way to do things according to him. My style is like, to me, For me, making a film is like ask you a question, and the answer is the film. In other words, I don't know the answer. Sometimes, as in, obviously, I knew how to make a gangster picture because I made a few of them. But when I made Apocalypse Now, I had no idea how to make it. If you don't know how to make a movie and you admit it and listen to the movie, the movie will tell you how to make it. It will do it for you. That's what I have found in many of my projects to be. And in a way, I deliberately create situations that cause accidents, sometimes big accidents. I don't mean the accidents that endanger life, because I never would do that.

[01:16:31.580] - Speaker 1
But in other words, I create accidents or do things and then make use of what happens so that the film has in it this excitement of it. I'll give you For example, like in The Godfather, Marlin is at the beginning of the movie, the first scene. At one point I saw a cat. It was not a movie cat. It was not an idea. It was just a studio cat. It was a cat. On the third or fourth take, I just picked it up and put it in his hand. He didn't say, What do you want me to do with this? I didn't say, I just put the cat in his hand. That's the take in the movie. I like the actors to know that whatever happens might be something we want. It's just my style. I don't care. Marlin once said something I thought was so interesting. He said to me about acting, he said, You can't care or they'll see it on your face. In a way, as a director, I don't care if I lose all the money I have. I didn't do this to make money. I did this to do something more beautiful than making money.

[01:17:45.760] - Speaker 1
And of course, I have to feed my kids and all that like everybody else, but that's not my high priority. I'll take chances in movies, and sometimes those chances give beautiful results. Sometimes they don't.

[01:18:01.200] - Speaker 2
You know enough to know it's out of your control, and you'll set the stage for something wonderful to happen.

[01:18:09.690] - Speaker 1
But it is under your control because you're not protecting yourself. You're doing it without a net. The stakes are high in something. I mean, not with human life. I have never killed any animal or creature in my life for any reason. I'm trying to get to the where I'll brush away mosquitoes. That's the hardest one. But like in the horse's head or the caribou being killed in, I had nothing to do with that. I just said, well, if it's going to happen, can I photograph it?

[01:18:48.050] - Speaker 2
Tell me about directing Brando.

[01:18:51.210] - Speaker 1
Well, Brando is very easy to direct because the first thing he does is he sits down and he puts his hand like that. He's asking basically where the frame is, and then he'll proceed to act with what's ever in that space. And he'll just do it. You can say things to him, like make it more angry, make it less angry, make it funny. He doesn't like to have acting talk. He just make it louder, make it softer. Basically, I always worked with Brando through props, as though I know that whatever I put in front of him, he's going to use. But he doesn't pan In other words, if... Here I am now, let's say a herd of Buffalo would run behind me, and that happened, he'd say, Oh, look at the Buffalo. He wouldn't say, Well, I better get out of here. He uses anything and everything when they're shooting.

[01:19:50.070] - Speaker 2
I never heard that idea before that he would want to know where the frame was and that he was aware of the framing and wanted to make everything work within the frame I would think of him, the method, as being more free and emotional, and he would go where he goes, and the camera would have to follow him because he would be free.

[01:20:12.990] - Speaker 1
But he knew what he was doing. For example, in Apocalypse Now, the problem was, I mean, I'm saying wonderful things about Brando, but the truth is he was like a big kid in terms of if you said, look, I don't want you to eat that ice cream, he would eat the ice cream. So when he came for Apocalypse Now, he knew that he was supposed to... He was got a Green Beret colonel, that he couldn't be a fat Green Beret colonel, but he came way overweight. But then he knew that. And I won't account the many steps of this, but basically, what that meant is that that's what made us shoot him in the dark with just a beam of light. But he had just that beam of light. But boy, did he use it? He poked his head in it. He poked his head out of it. In other words, whatever he was going to use, he used it creatively.

[01:21:10.280] - Speaker 2
That's a great example of problem solving, because you wanted the military guy to be in shape when he showed up, and he wasn't. So you shoot him in the dark, and it's iconic because of the fact that you were working around found something that you wouldn't have chosen.

[01:21:32.530] - Speaker 1
Right. In other words, when I first realized that he was so big, I said, Why don't we go the other way to him? I said, Why doesn't he be? He got big, and we show him with a mango in one hand and a native girl in the other. He said, No, no, no. In other words, he was shy about being overweight. My original thing is if it's raining and you can't shoot, figure out how to do the scene in the rain. If he's fat and he's a Green Beret guy, say he's a Green Beret guy who got fat and see him eating all the time and he's given into his senses. You could have done it that way. But people who are overweight, be it Marlon Brando or Orson Welles, no one who's fat likes to be fat, and they're shy and embarrassed by it. And Brando is no exception.

[01:22:26.050] - Speaker 2
How recent was the Vietnam War to Apocalypse Now, the film It was going on, I think.

[01:22:32.970] - Speaker 1
Really? Oh, yeah. I mean, it was right. It was near the end, but it was still going on. Wow. You know, the US, the guy who was Minister, the defense, Secretary of Defense was What the hell was his name? He had been it twice. But they totally said, no help, no helicopters, nothing American. We want nothing to do with apocalypse. So I found the helicopters and stuff in the Philippines. Rooms Rumsford. Secretary Rumsford. He was not a good guy.

[01:23:06.900] - Speaker 2
No. Would you describe yourself as confident or insecure?

[01:23:10.500] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm insecure. I mean, I I don't know of any artist who's totally confident. You know that you're walking on a ledge that you can fall off at any time.

[01:23:24.940] - Speaker 2
Would you say you're hard on yourself?

[01:23:28.430] - Speaker 1
All I know is this. Right now, there isn't a human being, guys who did terrible things to me that I haven't forgiven in my totally because I say, Well, they had their reasons. I wasn't on their mind. But the person that's hardest to forgive as yourself.

[01:23:48.620] - Speaker 2
Do you think of yourself as a perfectionist?

[01:23:54.290] - Speaker 1
I don't think of myself as a perfectionist, but I think I am a perfectionist. I have a counter right over there. I'm looking at it and there's nothing on it but a coffee machine and the thing. Someone's always putting a thing of basil over there because there's not a lot of room here. I like it the way it is. I don't even want this beautiful thing of basil over there. I want it the way I want it.

[01:24:20.320] - Speaker 2
How different is the finished movie of Patty than your script?

[01:24:25.720] - Speaker 1
It's very similar to my script. In fact, I would love someday with someone to take the movie because I shared the credit with someone else, which I don't mind. It's just like that script.

[01:24:40.370] - Speaker 2
I want you to walk me through making a movie. What happens when you make a movie? How much is intentional? Who brings what? How does it change?

[01:24:48.420] - Speaker 1
Okay, well, the first thing is you're getting pregnant with the movie. Like I am right now, and I'm taking an American writer that I just am a great admirer of. I just think she's the greatest is Edith Wharton. I mean, there are many American writers I admire, but many of them are women, but Edith Wharton. She wrote a not so great book, one of the ones that is less than her master. I mean, she means House of Earth and Age of Innocence and Ethan Fromm and all these. But she has a screwy little book called The Glimaces of the Moon. There's something about it fascinates me. But years ago, I directed, when I was just doing The Godfather, everyone was offering me chances to direct an opera, direct a play. I was getting all these possible things, and I figured, well, I'll do it. I'll learn something. I directed a play called Private Lives by Noel Cowery. Wonderful play. I came to love it because I directed it, but it's really a beautiful play. I did it in a very crazy way. In other words, do you know Private Lives at all? Noel Cowerd play?

[01:26:07.800] - Speaker 1
Mm-mm. Well, it's very funny, and it's about two honeymooning couples looking over the French River. It's always done with them leaning on the ballast, looking at the sea, with the audience being where the sea is because there's all this really funny, no-old, coward lines. What I wanted is I wanted to do it around the other way where you're looking at it the other way, so you're seeing them against the gorgeous view. Movied your record. I did it that way. Then there's a lot of music coming in, record players and stuff. Instead of them doing that I had a pianist on the apron of the stage doing it live. I did this play this way, and it was very successful. It was very well received. I loved it, and I loved Noel Cower. Somehow I decided I'm going to do this Edith Wharton adaptation of this movie I'm going to make as if I'm doing Noel Coward. There's no connection. The only connection between Noel Coward and Edith Wharton is me. So now I'm making it. I wrote a script and the ending of the the Edith Wharton novel is very weak. That's why it's not one of our biggest ones, but it is weak.

[01:27:29.220] - Speaker 1
But I came up with a way that's not weak. And so I'm just now here's exactly what I'm doing. I have a script which has filled with Noel Coward songs and a style that is not unlike the private lives that I... It's as though Noel Coward adapted a Edith Wharton book and is now making it in this movie in England, which is why I'm here, because I'm now actually in reproduction of that movie. So now I'm deciding what style I'm going to make. So I don't have any money because I invested all the money I borrowed to make Megalopolis is basically it's gone. I mean, I think it will come back over 15, 20 years, but I don't have it now, so I don't have any money. So I don't I have to do it very cheap, which I'm doing. And I'm starting to have people come over. I'm in this house where you see, which I borrowed from some person who I knew in Tulsa. I'm just working with nothing, but I'm starting to actually make the movie already, and then I can see how it could work, and then I feel it does work.

[01:28:43.630] - Speaker 1
It's beautiful. And these Noel Coward songs, which are 70 years old, are so beautiful when even people don't realize what he did. I mean, those guys like Cole Porter and Noel Coward and Roger and Heart, and Jerome Kern. I mean, this music is endlessly wonderful. So I'm seeing something that has no reason to exist, except I love it.

[01:29:12.410] - Speaker 2
Yeah. What was it about the book that fascinates motivated you?

[01:29:15.640] - Speaker 1
The premise is so absurd and wonderful. The premise, if I may tell you, is that in previous... Marriage was always about business and affairs of state, and I mean, this idea you meet someone, you fall in love, and you get married, that's very unusual. It wasn't like that. In the '30s and in the '20s, the marriageable group was so specific. Just in other words, you couldn't be part of it because you couldn't get past the butler in certain crowds. In other words, you had to have a certain education. There was a way that it had to be a certain group. In this story, In Glimses of the Moon, it's about this American group of these marriageable people. Because America had divorce, and many European countries didn't, what the Americans would do, they would go see people in England and in Bayreitz and France and equally wealthy people and stuff. They'd be married, but they'd have affairs. Then if they had an affair with someone who was wealthy than their husband or their wife, they would get a divorce and then they would marry upwards. And so it was this part. Well, there are two people in this crowd who are penniless.

[01:30:42.570] - Speaker 1
They lost all their money, their family lost all their money in the stock crash. Or they have all the elegance, they have all the intelligence, they have everything, but they don't have any money. But they're allowed to be in the crowd because they'll help out in a way, and they're accepted. They had this crazy idea that she had the idea that why don't they just get married? He said, well, what we live on? He said, we'll get all these wedding gifts from our friends and they'll let us go stay at all their houses in Venice and places and stuff. And then after, when the money runs out, then we'll help each other make a better match, which is what we're doing now. So basically, they do it. And the movie is, of course, about the inevitable fact that now the money is running out, but they love each other. But they've made this arrangement, and it's heartbreaking to them. But of course, I won't tell you, but it's very beautiful, I think, what happens in the story.

[01:31:50.390] - Speaker 2
Are all of your movies autobiographical?

[01:31:54.300] - Speaker 1
I think so. I'm starting to think worse. There's two of viewing life, you're doing it, I'm sure. When you're young, you view it from left to right. You're a young person looking out at what the future is going to be for yourself. But then there's a point as you get older where you switch and you're looking right to left and you're looking at that young person who you know is becoming you. There's philosophers that Heinziger writes about this. I'm at the point where I'm now looking at life from the point of view of where I am now, 85, and thinking about this kid who was so insecure and his mother probably didn't love him and all this stuff from this point of view. And then it occurs to me something even more strange, which is, what if I really am a solipsist? What if I'm all that exists? We all learn about that, Cardinal Barkley and solipsism and stuff. What if all the people like my wife, who I I love so much. What if she was just a chip of my consciousness? And so I tell you why, Rick, I feel that. Because when I made the godfather, I had no power.

[01:33:11.360] - Speaker 1
I was young. I was like Michael Corleone. When I made Apocalypse Now, I was in hock for $21 million. The interest was 21 %. I had to be like Kurtz. And then I made a film called Gardens of Stone about a man who creates this young soldier, and then he's killed, and I lost my son. I said, wait a second, what's going on here? Do I have to live every movie I make? Now, I make a film about a man who loses his son, and in the first week, I lose my son. I didn't. I wasn't even... So I think this is something weird is going on. Maybe I am a solipsis movie director, and I'm just making all of this stuff. So I put into Google, I think I'm a solipsis, what should I read? And the answer came up, read Andy Kaufman's novel, Ant Kind. Do you ever hear of Ant Kind? You know who Charlie, Charlie, Charlie Kaufman.

[01:34:18.330] - Speaker 2
Charlie Kaufman, yes.

[01:34:19.110] - Speaker 1
He wrote a novel called 700 page novel called Ant Kind. It's incredible. It's hilarious. So now I'm convinced that My life, the only way I can explain my life is that it's something Charlie Kaufman wrote. It's the only sense I can make out of it because a mind like that. Because otherwise, how did all this, how can I be living Am I really a filmmaker making my life?

[01:34:50.030] - Speaker 2
Yeah, nothing makes sense, really.

[01:34:52.190] - Speaker 1
It really does. And there's a good reason why it doesn't make sense, because our brain is so hardwired for our survival that we don't really even see the world as it is. That's why there isn't the creator. There's the creator and the destroyer. This idea of duality we have because it's helpful to our survival, but it isn't what the world really is, I don't think.

[01:35:21.130] - Speaker 2
Can you imagine by the limitation of not having money for this next film that you're making, that that could actually be a positive thing?

[01:35:29.540] - Speaker 1
Sure. Yeah, because I'm now making decisions. I did stuff in the last few days in this crazy house, not even my house, I bought it, that was so beautiful. Every time they said, Well, let's bring this because you don't have that. I said, No, we don't have any money. Well, let's do this. I know we can't. We don't have money. But we did everything we did without any money, and it was beautiful. Yeah. So I wouldn't have had it if I had money.

[01:35:56.030] - Speaker 2
How does new technology change filmmaking?

[01:36:00.410] - Speaker 1
Well, that's an interesting point because I always make a point with my young apprentices that I want them to learn how it was when it was filmed before it was digital. Just the same reason I teach people who are going to always drive automatic transmission, what it is to drive a stick, just so they understand it. The reason you need to understand how filmmaking was when it was filmed is because so many of the techniques traditions evolved for good reasons, which are no longer necessary. It's very hard for them to understand cinema making if they're born in a digital age. I have apprentices now. They're the filmmakers of the future. I have one from India, one from China. I mean, they're fantastic. You saw Megalopolis. You remember how the guy, what's his name? Caesar has all these apprentices? Those were my apprentices. They're really filmmakers, all of them. They were the only ones that could... I told everything that could criticize and have ideas, and they're brilliant.

[01:37:11.080] - Speaker 2
When did you start having apprentices? It's a great idea, by the way.

[01:37:14.130] - Speaker 1
Well, I mean, George Lucas was not my apprentice, but I treated young people like that. It's like that, though. But I tell you right now, Rick, the way to save this wreck of a world is to include the young people, start giving them responsibility because right now they'll say, Oh, those kids, all they care about is Minecraft and TikTok and stuff. That's because that's all they're allowed to do. I would involve them earlier. I would give 14-year-olds the right to vote, but four votes would be one vote. And then 16-year-olds, two votes would be one vote. In other words, I would get them in because they are capable of coming up with solutions that we're capable of coming up with, I don't think. All the great physicists who really did the incredible work in quantum physics, they were all 18, 19 years old. Just like, girl gymnasts can only do that stuff at 14. Physicists can only do what they're doing at 18. Even Einstein really was, he worked for a while in the patent office, but he was, these are young, these young minds we have were wasting. When you were offered to do Godfather 2, was it obvious that you wanted to do it?

[01:38:38.950] - Speaker 1
I didn't want to do it. At first, I didn't accept. I said I want nothing to do with it, except I would write it with Mario, and I would choose a director when we had a concept and suggest them. Then after a while, I told them, Okay, I have the idea, I have the thing, and I have three conditions. And they said, Well, who's the director you want? And I said, Well, he's Marty Scorsese. He wasn't in those days so famous. And they said, Absolutely not. I said, Well, then forget it. Finally, Charlie Boudron got on the phone and said, Francis, I'll give you anything you want. He said, That's what it sounded like. I said, Okay. Number one, I want total control. I don't want to have to talk to Bob Evans or anyone. If I want to say I'm starting, I'll start. All I'll agree to is the limit of the budget. The second thing was, I want to call it The Godfather Part 2. I don't want to give it Son of the Godfather or anything like that. Number three, I said, I want a million dollars, which I never had. And so they came back and they said, Well, we can give you the million dollars.

[01:39:49.650] - Speaker 1
You have total control. But everyone says that calling Godfather 2 is a mistake because people will think it's the second half of the movie they already saw. I said, Then forget it. Now, I'm the guy who started this Spider-Man 6. I'm so ashamed. Rocky 5. I should be shot.

[01:40:12.490] - Speaker 2
What's incredible about it, though, is that looking at the history of cinema, sequels and series tend to not be as good as the original. But in the case of Godfather 2, some people argue it's better than the Godfather. That's a very unusual situation.

[01:40:32.570] - Speaker 1
It was luck. I don't know. What is it? I tell you one thing, we had a preview of Godfather 2 in San Francisco that the audience hated it. And they said, The acting is terrible. I went to bed that night under the bed, so worried. And then it came to me. I said, The problem is that Godfather 2 was one between the past and the future back and forth, and it was always planned to go like every 10 minutes. It's too fast. I should double it. I should make it go every 20 minutes because the audience can't get yanked out of it. So the editors stayed up all night for three days and made 120 picture cuts to do that. Then we took the picture to San Diego, and the reaction was the opposite. They loved it. Then we took it to New York and they loved it, then the rest of it was successful. So movies are an illusion. And if you don't have the right, if they don't accept the illusion, like for years, they didn't accept Apocalypse Now. Gradually, Apocalypse Now got terrible reviews, didn't get any Oscar nominations. The people said...

[01:41:49.660] - Speaker 1
One important critic, I think his name was Frank Rich said it was the worst film ever made in Hollywood. But little by little, it got used it. When you go out on a ledge, you have to accept that everyone's not going to like it, and it may take time. The French Academy said what a good painting was, but poor guys like Matisse and everyone, you could give it away in those days. Now, of course, those are the paintings people want. They don't want the French Academy paintings.

[01:42:29.010] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get notes from a studio executive that were helpful at any point in your life?

[01:42:34.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You have to read through them and say, Oh, that was... Even Evans, who I was totally Magnistically, it was his idea to have a John Marley play the Hollywood guy. Who was the police captain? Sterling Hayden? That was Bob Evans' idea.

[01:42:59.450] - Speaker 2
Tell me about relationship with Evans.

[01:43:01.410] - Speaker 1
In Godfather, he assigned a guy as his guy to mind me named Jack Ballard. He was this production guy with a bald head, and he was horrible. He was on my case every day saying, you're late, you have a meal plan, you can't do this. Then at one point, they told me that they were going to bring in an action director because there was no action in the movie, and I had to basically Basically, I took my kid and my sister Tali, who was in the movie, and we went the weekend and made that scene where she breaks all of crockery and stuff just to not have them bring in. They were always either firing me or replacing me. Once I was told on a Tuesday, the first day Brando came in, everyone said that they hated Brando's first day's work. I said, well, look at it. I said, he's the first Hey, it's an actor. He give him a few days. I said, tell you what, I can go back. It's Tuesday. I can go right back in there and reshoot the scene. And they say, no, no, don't do that. And then one of the producers who was a friend of mine said, The reason they won't let you go in is because they're going to fire you this Friday.

[01:44:22.220] - Speaker 1
They never fire a director in the middle of the week. They always fire him on Friday, so the new director has the weekend to to come in on Monday. They said, They're going to fire me Friday? Who is they going to bring? They want your editor to be, who had directed a picture. And I had, I love this editor guy. I still do. He's gone, of course. And he had made a picture and he asked me, would you hire my producers and different people on his crew to be your assistant director, which I did. But they were conspiring all the time to get me fired and get him made. So they said, okay, they're going to fire this weekend. I knew that this editor, Aramavakian, would never. He was my friend. I know he wouldn't have done that. He was worried about me, but I don't think he, I'm sure he would not He would not do that. Basically, I fired them all on the Tuesday that I told you this, and then I took Brandon and I went back up there and I shot the scene again. So now they had to wait to see whether the scene was any better or not.

[01:45:31.820] - Speaker 1
So this shook everyone up. Everyone was, I'm sure, can he do that? Can he fire everyone? Well, he did. I didn't have the right to fire everyone. I just did it and said, okay, now we're going up and doing it. I just took that chance. So, of course, then they saw the footage and they said, oh, the new stuff with Brando is much better. We think it's very good. But what's in the movie is the old one.

[01:45:57.940] - Speaker 2
When you finish When you finished the movie before it screened, what were your thoughts about the movie? Did you know it was going to be a big hit?

[01:46:06.800] - Speaker 1
No, I was sure it was a flop because at the last minute, Evans hated the music, and he ordered me to take the music out. I said to him, I'm not going to take the music out. You can fire me and get a new director and have the new director put the music you want in, but I'm not going to take the music out. I love the music. So for about four days, Walter Murch was there with me because he was working with me. For four days, we were in a stalemate where I wouldn't change. I mean, they could have just changed the music, but they didn't want to fire me a week before the picture came out. So No one had ever seen the picture. No audience had ever seen the picture. It was always Paramount and Evans and the inside guy saying the picture isn't working. It's too long, it's too short. It was driving me crazy. So finally, I I say to him, to Bob Evans, I said, Tell you what, this is what I'll do. Let's show it to a controlled group of people, which had never happened, and see if they liked the music or not.

[01:47:13.700] - Speaker 1
He said to me, Who gets to decide whether they like the music or not? I said, You do. Wow, because you knew. No, I didn't know. I knew I loved the music. No, but you knew that you wanted to get a real reaction.

[01:47:28.740] - Speaker 2
And if there was a real reaction, everybody would know the real reaction.

[01:47:32.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but I didn't know. I loved the music, but he hated the music and wanted Johnny Green to... I think the problem was he had promised Johnny Green, and I had this Italian guy great Italian. Anyway, they all came in, about 300 people to a Paramount screening room, and it was the first time an audience saw the movie other than the executives and stuff. When it was over, it was incredible. We said, What did you think of the music? He said, The whole movie is great. What do you mean to me? They weren't even talking about the music. They were talking about the picture. We've never seen anything like it. It was Wonderful. And then he said, The music is great. It was incredible. Finally, Evans conceded, and he just had some music changes of when there's some old source music when they fly into Las Vegas. And at that point, I then knew that I had... But another guy had seen the picture that is like a big brother to me. Did you ever hear of a guy named Robert Town?

[01:48:43.690] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:48:44.230] - Speaker 1
He wrote China of town. I always have this big brother figure in my life because I had a great big brother. And Bob Town was someone I looked up, and he's the first person who said, Francis, the film is great. And he says, Brando is great. He said, it only needs one thing. And I said, what's that, Bob? He said, It needs a scene between Brando and Al Pacino. And I said, well, would you write it? He said, yes. And he did. And he wrote the scene. And when I won the Oscar, I said, Bob Towne wrote the scene and did a lot of other great things. But yeah, he was the only one who was encouraging. Everyone else thought it was a big flop. Even when it was opening, I had no idea what was going to happen. I had no money And so I accepted a job to rewrite the Great Gatsby film that they were doing with Redford because I had three kids. And I was writing this and I was horrified because the Great Gatsby novel doesn't have a lot of dialog in it. So I meant I had to make it up and I had only a week to do it.

[01:49:51.780] - Speaker 1
So I'm calling my wife and she's in New York. She says, Francis, the Godfather is going to open. They said it's going to be in five theaters because it's getting such good reaction. And she's telling me, my God, there are people going around the block waiting to see the Godfather. I can't talk to you. Elia, I got to finish this script. It was so crazy. The biggest success I ever had, which was, of course, the Godfather, I wasn't there because I was trying to write the script for the Great Gatsby.

[01:50:23.590] - Speaker 2
Was that Paramount screening the first time you got to see it on a big screen?

[01:50:28.390] - Speaker 1
I showed it to all my friends, which was pretty much the same cut. All the film savvy people in San Francisco, no one said it was so great.

[01:50:37.640] - Speaker 2
Who was Al Ruddy?

[01:50:39.790] - Speaker 1
Al Ruddy was a producer who, along with his partner, gray Fredrickson, was making a film in San Francisco with Sydney Furia, I think. And he had a company called Alfran, because he had a rich wife whose name was Françoise. And since The Godfather was basically an unimportant project to Paramount at that time, they got this Al Fran, which was Al Ruddy, and his partner got the job. But Al Ruddy was never around. He was always cooking up. He made a big thing about the anti-Italian. There was a Mafia guy who started an anti-Italian League. Al Ruddy was just never around. He only showed around when there was a publicity still. And he's the guy who wrote the book that they made that show, The Offer, which nothing happened where they said it was, nothing happened the way they said it was, and nothing's happened with whom they said it was. The picture, they had a movie star play Al Ruddy, and there's a nice still of him there with a guy with a beard that's supposed to be me. There's no real picture of Al Ruddy there because he was never there. For example, in The Offer, they Showing everyone riding around in a studio, Paramount picture and stuff.

[01:52:05.230] - Speaker 1
Paramount didn't own the studio in those days. We were in an office in Crescent in Beverly Hills. The studio, I never was in the studio because they didn't own it. You know who owned it? No. The Vatican. The Vatican had a big Italian company, real estate company that invested in real estate, and they owned Paramount Studio.

[01:52:27.520] - Speaker 2
That's amazing. How has the film business changed over the course of your life?

[01:52:33.320] - Speaker 1
Well, I saw it change into the era of the so-called blockbuster. And then because of the outrageously overcharging cable fees that were initially done, the cable companies made so much money that they then bought the film industry so that now the film industry is owned by people who bought from people who bought from people who bought from people who owned it. So the only thing the people who run the film studios are worrying about is the debt service. That they are hired and paid a lot of money to ensure that the company makes this debt service. And if it doesn't, they're fired. So that you're dealing with not only a company, but a whole antique system. In other words, when there was a trolley car on Santa Monica Boulevard years ago when I was a kid, and when they removed the trolley car, they also removed the tracks because they never wanted a trolley car back. They wanted it to be busses. So there's the movie companies, but there's the tracks. The tracks are the Rotten Tomat and the Siretings and In other words, all of the accoutrement that are the train tracks or the infrastructure is all controlled by these companies that are desperately trying to not go bankrupt.

[01:53:59.890] - Speaker 1
So that if you're not on their side, if you're not in their world, then you're not going to get four stars, you're going to get no stars. It's like the people, for example, in another analogy, it is possible to make jet fuel for aircraft that will not pollute the Earth. But to do that, they say, We're up for it. We want any solution to that. We'll buy it. But what they don't say is that the tracks, the infrastructure, what takes the fuel from the tank to the airplane is what they own. And what would work would be hydrogen. But their system can't operate because it doesn't hold hydrogen at those low temperature. So in other words, it's not just the people who own the existing systems. They also own the infrastructure that supports it. That's more important to them.

[01:54:54.350] - Speaker 2
Do you know how the Godfather was received in Italy?

[01:54:57.890] - Speaker 1
I think it was very, very well received. Il Padrino. It was a big hit. I know because I ended up having more cousins than I thought I had.

[01:55:10.140] - Speaker 2
What's the most beautiful place you've ever been on the planet?

[01:55:14.800] - Speaker 1
I have to say that my wife and I went to Syria, and it was extraordinary. It was before all the war and the Arab Spring and everything. We just thought it was just the most wonderful, beautiful. The people were just so sweet and nice, and the food was so great. And we went to see the Palmera, and it was an enchanted time We were there a good three weeks, too. Wow.

[01:55:49.100] - Speaker 2
That's beautiful. I would not have expected that answer.

[01:55:51.040] - Speaker 1
It was an unforgettable trip, and the people were wonderful. But people are wonderful. Human beings are You always say, Oh, those people are not nice, and then you go there and they're nice. Yeah, everywhere. Everywhere.
