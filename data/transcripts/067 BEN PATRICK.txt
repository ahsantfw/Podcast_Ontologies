[00:00:22.990] - Speaker 1
For me, jumping, you grow up in basketball, you see Michael Jordan, you want to be able to jump high. You kind of know some genetics are going to factor in. So for me, once I started getting older, getting into high school, I was kind of the kid made fun of who couldn't jump high, couldn't touch the rim.

[00:00:39.560] - Speaker 2
Could you ever jump high before that?

[00:00:41.410] - Speaker 1
No. So I was never a high jumper. And then even by high school, I already had chronic knee pain. So it's like being made fun of for not being able to jump high. Lowest jumper on the team. But I'm trying to work on it, which is only beating up my knees more.

[00:00:54.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:00:55.200] - Speaker 1
So it took this kind of not being a natural jumper, but trying to work at it really hard, all these jumping drills, but not knowing how to strengthen my knees. So it just got worse. So rather than would you say you.

[00:01:07.460] - Speaker 2
Had bad information, I mean, there was.

[00:01:10.490] - Speaker 1
No data at the time, at least broadly available on strengthening your knees and basketball. If you look at someone jumping, your knees don't bend all the way down. So with basketball, it's played up high. And if you just do more and more and more of that, well, millions of other people have gotten knee pain from that, too. And there wasn't broad information at the time of things I could do to balance that out. So, okay, going backward with the sled, you're able to start getting out of pain. You're going in reverse. So jumping, you're slamming force forward. Going backward. You're now reversing that and then figuring out how to get into deeper strengthening. So because my knees were just getting worse, it's not like from 14 to 18, I increased my vertical. It kept going down because I just kept having more knee problems. Then you have surgery that sets you back a ton. So, yeah, I reached full adulthood thinking I would never be close to dunking this lifetime.

[00:02:03.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah. You were never able to dunk before?

[00:02:06.620] - Speaker 1
Not even close. And then now it's like too easy. In my thirties. It's weird.

[00:02:11.270] - Speaker 2
So tell me about that transition from not being able to do it, needing surgery, having. As far as the people that you played with, would you say your knees were among the worst of the people you played with?

[00:02:22.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You know, your friends in high school. Yeah. You know who's kind of known for what?

[00:02:27.210] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:02:27.680] - Speaker 1
I was the guy made fun of for my fragile knees, my knee pain, icing my knees. It would take me longer than everyone else to warm up. Being the lowest jumper on the team, getting made fun of for my vertical, that's like who I was.

[00:02:39.900] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:02:40.640] - Speaker 1
Then knee surgery only gets worse.

[00:02:43.120] - Speaker 2
Yep.

[00:02:43.900] - Speaker 1
I ended up. I just dropped out by the end of high school. Cause I was gonna be, like, in a wheelchair, in a walker. I didn't wanna go around campus. I just dropped out and finished some homeschool thing. I have no idea where my high school certificate is or whatever, and had given up on believing that's.

[00:03:01.310] - Speaker 2
How long were you not able to walk from the surgery?

[00:03:04.990] - Speaker 1
Well, I had a partial kneecap replacement. That was the one that really, like, because the knee wouldn't bend for a long time, so it was. It was some months. How old were you?

[00:03:15.170] - Speaker 2
1818 years old.

[00:03:17.090] - Speaker 1
Partial kneecap replacement among two other surgical changes, Mike.

[00:03:21.290] - Speaker 2
All at the same time or all separately?

[00:03:22.930] - Speaker 1
Those were done at the same time.

[00:03:24.010] - Speaker 2
Okay.

[00:03:24.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:03:25.210] - Speaker 2
One surgery, three different things done.

[00:03:27.590] - Speaker 1
That's right.

[00:03:28.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:03:28.940] - Speaker 1
Then told I needed more knee surgeries in my right knee. I was, like, rock bottom. Like, even though I thought I needed surgeries, but I was like, I don't know what I was thinking exactly. Just like, I just didn't want to go through with it. Yeah, it's okay. I'm not even going to try to do basketball now. Just purely scouring for stuff to do for my knees.

[00:03:49.300] - Speaker 2
And up till that point, all that you wanted to do was play basketball? Yes. Basketball was your life.

[00:03:54.860] - Speaker 1
I was one of those obsessive kids with one sport, which, in hindsight, Michael Jordan didn't get serious about basketball until he was maybe 16, he was playing different sports. Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, the guys widely regarded as the best basketball players of all time, played different sports growing up. So I didn't even realize in my mind, okay, I'm trying to be like my hero, not realizing that my regimen isn't what my hero was doing. My hero, Michael Jordan had a more balanced childhood. And I was. By eight, it was like basketball. Yeah, I was already a fan by four or five, but by eight, it was like, okay, can't play any other sport.

[00:04:32.470] - Speaker 2
Also, by eight, you don't know how tall you're gonna be. That's another thing. Like, and that seems to matter a lot in basketball.

[00:04:38.250] - Speaker 1
Yeah, a lot of factors. That's a big one. So in my mind at eight, I'm thinking, cut out the other sports.

[00:04:43.990] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:04:44.420] - Speaker 1
Just focus on basketball. Yeah, no one's telling you at eight. I mean, that would be kind of an awful thing to say to an eight year old. Like, hey, if you want to just play basketball, you're probably gonna have knee surgery. But I'm sure it would be an easy survey to find that people who specialize only in one sport at a young age are gonna be more prone to the injuries of that sport.

[00:05:03.100] - Speaker 2
Makes sense.

[00:05:03.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:05:04.370] - Speaker 2
Makes sense.

[00:05:05.440] - Speaker 1
Yep. So because I went through all that stuff, the knee stuff, then was just trying to find knee solutions. Found that if I would go to this gym, they had this rickety sled, I would take it out to the parking lot.

[00:05:17.610] - Speaker 2
How'd you learn about the idea of the sled?

[00:05:19.730] - Speaker 1
There's a. An Olympic trainer, rest in peace, named Charles Poliquin trained Olympic athletes, and he became obsessed with going backward with the sled like crazy when he had an Olympic athlete who had an injury. But he has to get, like, the Olympics are in three months or six months or whatever, and they're told, like, sorry, you're not gonna compete in the Olympics.

[00:05:41.510] - Speaker 2
That's interesting.

[00:05:42.140] - Speaker 1
So he had some athletes.

[00:05:43.410] - Speaker 2
Did you read it?

[00:05:44.520] - Speaker 1
Read it.

[00:05:45.090] - Speaker 2
You read it in the book?

[00:05:45.690] - Speaker 1
Just on Internet.

[00:05:46.780] - Speaker 2
Internet, yeah.

[00:05:48.120] - Speaker 1
He doesn't have a lot on the knee subject.

[00:05:50.780] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes.

[00:05:51.760] - Speaker 1
And I ended up going and studying with him in person.

[00:05:54.690] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:05:55.130] - Speaker 1
So I could ask all these questions. So he would use this backward like crazy because he found that was something he could do, that you could recover from it fast, and he could actually get the knees to get stronger and heal at the same time and get ready for the Olympics. He learned about it just as I went to the source to learn from him. He went to the source of a guy named Louie Simmons, who's probably the most famous powerlifting coach ever. And he was observing Finland power lifters with these incredible legs, and he's like, how do you get these legs? And they credited their day job dragging trees. They were in the forestry industry. So it went from powerlifters in Finland dragging trees to Louis Simmons going, hey, that can be an exercise. Like, dragging stuff is an exercise. To then Charles Pollock.

[00:06:42.520] - Speaker 2
So dragging before this, nobody dragged, at.

[00:06:46.550] - Speaker 1
Least as far as the history credits it.

[00:06:48.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:06:48.950] - Speaker 1
Dragging wasn't an exercise form.

[00:06:51.430] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:06:52.370] - Speaker 1
So Louis Simmons started that as an exercise form, and he would do backward and forward and particularly the backward. This Olympic trainer found Washington just a gold mine in terms of fixing the knee when he had to help. An athlete like, you can't just stop playing your sport. It's like you're trying to win a medal. There's people right now.

[00:07:08.370] - Speaker 2
It's also an exercise that you can't get hurt doing. It's not dangerous.

[00:07:13.650] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Fundamentally, it is different. My mom is 70. For demo purposes, I hooked her up to a thousand pound sled I loaded the sled with 1000 pounds, hooked up my seven year old mother, said, try to drag it backward. Well, the thing didn't budge.

[00:07:30.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but she didn't hurt.

[00:07:31.390] - Speaker 1
She didn't want to try again soon, but she wasn't hurt because the weight's not bearing down on you. So it's just. It is fundamentally different.

[00:07:37.540] - Speaker 2
Yeah. As far as exercise goes, it's a safe exercise.

[00:07:41.210] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It would be like doing something in a pool.

[00:07:43.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:07:43.730] - Speaker 1
All right. You have. There's certain just measurable factors that make it safer. So a sled dragging something is fundamentally different than lifting weights. Doesn't mean it's better than.

[00:07:52.890] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because it's not weight bearing. There's nothing pushing down on you.

[00:07:56.810] - Speaker 1
Exactly. So.

[00:07:58.480] - Speaker 2
But it's still a weight exercise. You're still pulling weight, you're just not.

[00:08:02.940] - Speaker 1
It's vigorous.

[00:08:03.920] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:08:04.560] - Speaker 1
And so, like, I was in this position where I'm on painkillers, there's always things I can't do. And so I'm going to the gym and basically doing upper body. It's like, what can I do for my leg? Or you're hoping that some therapy thing works? Yeah, hoping. Hoping. So then when I found the sled thing, I found I could go work sweat, legs burning and the pain going down. I mean, to this day, like, I'm just as fired up as I was at 19 years old in that parking lot because I could do something. And I just did it and did it and did it throughout the painkillers.

[00:08:38.930] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:08:39.600] - Speaker 1
Stopped having ice my knees. I was icing them four times a day.

[00:08:42.650] - Speaker 2
Wow. You never had to have the second surgery?

[00:08:45.070] - Speaker 1
No.

[00:08:45.700] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:08:46.750] - Speaker 1
Never even had my knees looked at again.

[00:08:48.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And now your knee condition, how would.

[00:08:51.450] - Speaker 1
You say beyond what I thought was possible in terms of, like, extreme ability of the knees, you went from never.

[00:09:00.410] - Speaker 2
Being able to dunk a basketball to now being able to dunk easily, and even to being able to dunk from standing still. Not with a run up, which I don't know if most basketball players can do that.

[00:09:13.190] - Speaker 1
Not at my height. At my height, it would be unusual for a basketball player to be able to squat down and spring up and down normally. You would need a running start.

[00:09:20.480] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:09:21.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So this sled thing was like my stepping stone, and it's now I've been sent just thousands upon thousands of people with the same experience.

[00:09:27.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it's not just for people with injured knees. Anyone who wants to strengthen their knees can do this.

[00:09:35.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:09:35.930] - Speaker 2
It's a healthy exercise to strengthen your knees.

[00:09:38.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I've been coaching others now for over 13 years because I pretty instantly started training people. It was so helpful. I was helping past friends from high school who also had had to quit their sport, stuff like that. So 13 plus years by this point. My passions are knees and longevity. Like the fact my mom, at 70 now, she started six years ago and she can sprint. She looks like a 20 year old when she sprints.

[00:10:02.690] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:10:03.210] - Speaker 1
And it's so great. Cause she knows her formula for life. She has incredible mobility. With my kids, it's like, boom, exercise is solved for her and the foundation is sledden, and that means forward and backward. But the reason that's her foundation is because she can go, she can get a vigorous workout, she can power up her leg, she can get incredible circulation and all safely. I just haven't found something where you can get all of those factors so safely. So, in fact, I would actually relate this sled. Sure, there might be someone young, healthy, they can do deep squats, Olympic weightlifting, and they might think, what a joke, I don't need that. And to some degree they're right. But that's where the more broken down someone is, the older someone is, the more that becomes the foundation. And if you go into a gym and you do the leg press or most of the common leg exercise in the gym, your feet are flat. So the interesting thing, when you're doing a sled, I did it for the knee, but you're pushing through your toe whether you're going forward or backward. It's a natural motion for the foot, it's not a flat footed motion.

[00:11:01.000] - Speaker 1
So my whole training process now has become train from the ground up. So you start pushing through the toes, and by the end of the session, I'm finishing with like the elbow or the wrist. So I quite literally train from the toes, ankle, then get into the deeper legwork, then spine posture. And that's how I do a session. So that sled is like our foundational principle.

[00:11:19.510] - Speaker 2
How many students do you have now?

[00:11:21.860] - Speaker 1
Thousands of students. I put the data like anything in my head. My philosophy is that should be like free just for everyone. So I try at weekend week out to take this data and make it fast where someone can study it, then some of those people.

[00:11:36.600] - Speaker 2
And that will be on Instagram main place.

[00:11:38.240] - Speaker 1
Instagram, YouTube. I've started doing threads on x Twitter. Those be the three main, because it's like three different styles. YouTube, you have the wide screen, the longer form. Instagram, you have the vertical shorter, and then x Twitter, you have the written with then the silent pictures. I think that's actually my favorite one because people can go at their own pace, absorb it almost like a little book or something with silent demos. And then I. For over six years, I've been trying to make coaching affordable. So my highest price is $50 a month, no contract. And we answer you under 24 hours, seven days a week, and coach your form so you could send in video of yourself doing any of these exercises. We'll answer you. Coach you under 24 hours, seven days a week, $50 a month, no long term contract.

[00:12:25.620] - Speaker 2
Is it easy to video yourself in a way that you can see what needs to be seen for each exercise?

[00:12:34.170] - Speaker 1
I tell you which way to put the phone. Would it be better to have someone in person? Yeah, sure. There's now not thousands, but there's hundreds of coaches now around the world teaching needs over time. Yeah. That I've certified.

[00:12:47.290] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:12:47.950] - Speaker 1
That they now know everything I know and can work with people in person.

[00:12:50.980] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:12:51.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think most people doing it are just observing it, studying it for free and doing it. And then you have a smaller percent that do the online and then a smaller percent of that who then actually pay for personal training.

[00:13:03.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Anyone can do it for free.

[00:13:05.300] - Speaker 1
Yep.

[00:13:05.830] - Speaker 2
And then you can get more specific feedback to make sure you're doing them to the best of your ability with video.

[00:13:15.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:13:16.250] - Speaker 2
And then in person, if you want to. The results might not be any different. And the fact that it started by teaching people for free is amazing. And one thing I love about it is you didn't set out to be a coach. You set out to be a basketball player. And you were trying to help yourself. You were trying to cure yourself. You had a terrible problem. And through your dedication to solving your problem, now thousands, maybe tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands are changing their lives because you were taking care of yourself. It's incredible. It's an incredible story.

[00:13:55.680] - Speaker 1
I got very lucky.

[00:13:56.920] - Speaker 2
It's amazing. Have you yet found anything that can come close to what the sled can do that doesn't involve long distance? It's one of the downsides of the sled is you need a long, flat place to do it.

[00:14:12.370] - Speaker 1
Yep. Either good weather, a long, flat plate. Also, I remember being in that parking lot, and if it had rained a little earlier, like some days, it was like, oh, it's too hot outside, and the friction is just like.

[00:14:24.020] - Speaker 2
It's hard to make it consistent.

[00:14:26.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. Sled on turf is ideal.

[00:14:29.200] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:14:29.780] - Speaker 1
That gym I started out at, though, didn't have that. So the first thing I found is like, if it was raining outside.

[00:14:34.890] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:14:35.370] - Speaker 1
I could go into one of the treadmills at the gym. Not turn it on, turn around, put my butt against the handles, and spin the belt backward. Most treadmills at the gym have some degree of internal resistance. It's like a set amount. Like, you'll feel it. Now, some of them are locked and you can't move it. But about. It seems like about 90% of treadmill models will move if not turned on. And it almost mimics the sled. And so tons of people that has worked for them.

[00:15:01.880] - Speaker 2
Could there be a specific device that designed to do that?

[00:15:06.180] - Speaker 1
Cause that seems I eventually did that.

[00:15:07.660] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it exists now.

[00:15:08.830] - Speaker 1
They're all over the world now I sell them.

[00:15:10.410] - Speaker 2
What's it called?

[00:15:11.260] - Speaker 1
The backward treadmill.

[00:15:12.430] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:15:13.180] - Speaker 1
It's $600.

[00:15:14.610] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:15:15.090] - Speaker 1
There's no electricity, so it's a lot cheaper than a regular treadmill.

[00:15:17.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:15:18.210] - Speaker 1
And honestly, it's changed our lives. Cause it's just this simple.

[00:15:20.700] - Speaker 2
And is it safe and comfortable?

[00:15:22.790] - Speaker 1
People have found it a little bit safer than the sled only in the sense that when you are dragging a sled, you still kinda have to be able to balance your own body to some degree. Whereas with this, there's railings. So, like, if I'm even working with someone and they can't do a sled, they often find, well, they can hold on to the railings. Like, they can support some of their weight balance and then spin it backward that way. And so, yeah, we have a 1.0 model that's now all over the world.

[00:15:49.280] - Speaker 2
And I'm so happy working on a.

[00:15:50.680] - Speaker 1
2.0 because playing with it backwards, sometimes I turn around and spin it forward, and I'm like, wow, this is really good for running, too. So it's a process. You start a product.

[00:15:59.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:15:59.960] - Speaker 1
Do the best you can. I'll never stop trying to improve what I can do for the buck.

[00:16:07.140] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the process of designing a new piece of equipment and what goes into it.

[00:16:13.900] - Speaker 1
I got lucky. Cause all these people I've been helping for free.

[00:16:17.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:16:17.890] - Speaker 1
Have a lot of resources.

[00:16:19.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:16:19.590] - Speaker 1
And so brilliant engineers and people like that who are grateful to help and understand what it takes to start. And don't gouge me on price or however it works. And then some of these people, I'm able to gradually just then integrate into my team. And so, quite frankly, haven't had to do jack shit other than use it a ton and then give them feedback. And really, that's about it.

[00:16:43.810] - Speaker 2
So it basically was crowdsourced. Essentially.

[00:16:46.500] - Speaker 1
Basically, yeah. My whole staff really is almost like people who were like doing it. My app is made by one of my first guys when I was, I first coached people online with WhatsApp and Google Docs and private YouTube. So it was just all free stuff. And then eventually a website and then him being a coder and being like, okay, we can do much better than this. And then he's worked for me, he's full time. So that my whole team is all really people who were doing this stuff had results and were like students essentially, hey, I am an engineer or I'm a this and I would love to do something that's really helping people and do my job. And then I'm lucky that my wife is really a brilliant businesswoman.

[00:17:30.310] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:17:31.170] - Speaker 1
I was the not understanding money and she's brilliant with that. So she's been able to turn these into really good jobs for people.

[00:17:38.450] - Speaker 2
Excellent. Tell me about the app.

[00:17:40.650] - Speaker 1
Cool. So this is where it comes in. I don't know how to code anything. I knew I wanted the least clicks necessary. Like I want to open up the app and with the least number of clicks be able to see every program, be able to see how to do any exercise and be able to send in so you, right from the app, boom, click. And you can film your own form. Right. You don't have to like go out and film yourself from your photos, doesn't shut off your music. If you want to keep listening to your music.

[00:18:04.160] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:18:04.840] - Speaker 1
And he's always trying to work on it. It's really that simple. You could see any program, any exercise, film yourself, ask questions with the least number of click necessary.

[00:18:14.350] - Speaker 2
Great. So you can, you can learn the exercise from on the app?

[00:18:17.490] - Speaker 1
Yep.

[00:18:18.110] - Speaker 2
And then you can send in your version of it and get any feedback of how to do it better.

[00:18:23.830] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:18:24.570] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:18:25.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's like what would I want as a user? I wouldn't really want to pay more than 50 a month for coaching.

[00:18:29.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And 50 months for coaching is six days a week.

[00:18:35.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Whatever someone wants. We don't limit how much you, some people make.

[00:18:39.600] - Speaker 2
Typically it's like six days a week is the program that you do and that you recommend.

[00:18:44.060] - Speaker 1
Maybe from three to six.

[00:18:45.280] - Speaker 2
Three to six, yeah. Okay.

[00:18:46.600] - Speaker 1
I'd say now with two kids I'm more of like a three days full body just feel incredible.

[00:18:52.330] - Speaker 2
That's great.

[00:18:53.060] - Speaker 1
And then, but not be like having to drag myself. Like my three workouts now are like just like my time and feels incredible.

[00:19:00.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And at the end of your workouts you don't feel like you killed yourself.

[00:19:05.040] - Speaker 1
Someone could, but the idea is that, yeah, you'd feel pretty good. Like, you'd feel more limber. You'd feel really good. Really good circulation. That would be the goal.

[00:19:14.280] - Speaker 2
So typically, for the $50, it's 1212 to 24. Yeah, like, 24. Like, a lot of sessions.

[00:19:22.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:19:22.750] - Speaker 2
Which, if anyone's ever hired a personal trainer, it's much more expensive than that.

[00:19:26.350] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And again, for someone else, the personal trainer might really be the best thing for them.

[00:19:31.760] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.

[00:19:32.780] - Speaker 1
So, like, when I was having problems.

[00:19:35.250] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:19:35.930] - Speaker 1
No way. I would have afforded more than $50 a month.

[00:19:38.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And this would have sped up your whole process had you had all this information then.

[00:19:45.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's about what I was spending, if not a little more. When I was like a teenager, I would read books. I would sign up for online programs. Sometimes I would save up for a personal training session with someone. So, yeah, I just looked back and was, like, someone in the online coaching game who was really smart and actually gave me a ton of helpful advice. But when it came to price, they were like, yeah, to do this, you have to charge at least $100 a month. Like, have to. Because I specifically said you have to charge at least $99 a month. And I was like, all right, I'll do it for half that. Everyone's kind of like, I don't know if, you know, maybe you could start like that and then increase the price if you need to. But we've just been able to stay that way.

[00:20:26.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's always been. It always has seemed that your mission is as much a humanitarian mission as anything else. And whatever financial success you have is just bonus, really.

[00:20:40.730] - Speaker 1
My mom taught me, you measure your worth by how much you help other people. Plenty comes back. That's what I found to be true. I was never really big into material stuff. I also don't think it would be accurate to be, like, to deny that side of it as well.

[00:20:56.710] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.

[00:20:57.650] - Speaker 1
So I think there's levels to it. I think there's people who just dislike money, don't want to have it. Other people that it's like every day they're thinking, how can I get more? And then for me, it's like, that just gets stressful. I mean, you start looking at, how could I do Facebook, advertise it? So, like, I don't do a penny of ads. It's just another stress. Yeah, I'll put out what I can.

[00:21:17.340] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:21:17.810] - Speaker 1
For free.

[00:21:18.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:21:19.390] - Speaker 1
And if it helps people, yes. People want to support because I'm the same way, yeah, if I like, I've got value. I'm gonna buy your shit. I'm gonna buy a t shirt. I'm gonna buy, like, absolutely. It comes back. I probably could make more money if I learned from a Facebook marketing. Like, I probably could. There's probably things I could do, but I mean, it just.

[00:21:38.170] - Speaker 2
It's not your model.

[00:21:39.020] - Speaker 1
I'm not happier at the end of the day by trying to think about. It's like, put out good stuff, have good services that do financially work out so you can pay your bills, you can pay people well. And that's where I lucked out with my wife being really interested in that because I was too much on the side of, like, just help. People don't need money. Well, but now you got to pay bills, and now you don't have time to put out the free content. So that's because I could pay my bills. I have the time to put out the free content.

[00:22:06.030] - Speaker 2
Yes. I learned TM when I was 14, and one of the things that Maharishi said about TM was, it doesn't cost any money to do TM, but he made it where you had to pay to learn it, and you had to pay. He decided whatever it costs to buy a refrigerator. And his idea was, if you didn't pay for it, it wouldn't have as much value to you, the user. And meditation is as important in his mind as a refrigerator. So if you paid, like, for a refrigerator, he wouldn't buy a refrigerator and not use it.

[00:22:49.590] - Speaker 1
Right.

[00:22:50.020] - Speaker 2
You have to pay enough to where you're going to get your money's worth by doing it.

[00:22:54.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:22:55.360] - Speaker 2
And it's interesting.

[00:22:56.790] - Speaker 1
You're right. I think there's a lot of truth to that. Someone pays for something now, they feel obligated to use it.

[00:23:01.070] - Speaker 2
They feel like they're invested in it in some way.

[00:23:04.720] - Speaker 1
Exactly. I think there's a lot of truth to that. Yeah. There's so many different ways to look at the business stuff. And it was like that original knee mentor of mine, Charles Poliquin, one of his strongest pieces. Advice was don't see life through a straw.

[00:23:18.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:23:19.040] - Speaker 1
And that has just helped me so much in any situation to just be able to see, like, there's pros and cons, there's different values. There's no, like, one absolute way. Cause when you're on social media, it's almost like people are waiting to attack every different possible lack of context or. So I just try to see, look, there's context in everything.

[00:23:40.470] - Speaker 2
I know that you are focused on work primarily in your life.

[00:23:45.790] - Speaker 1
Not anymore.

[00:23:46.840] - Speaker 2
Oh, really?

[00:23:47.500] - Speaker 1
Not with two toddlers?

[00:23:48.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:23:49.350] - Speaker 1
I mean, that's.

[00:23:49.830] - Speaker 2
Well, work and family.

[00:23:51.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah. About six ish years ago.

[00:23:54.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:23:54.770] - Speaker 1
Got a dog. Didn't want a dog. I. Of course, now I'm obsessed with him. He chews up the remote of the tv, and I was the kind that I would show up at work early, stay late, get home exhausted, veg out, watch Netflix or whatever. I just thought that was like, all right. Like, I have to. So when he chewed up the remote, I was kind of like, I need to get my shit together. So I tried to, like, go a year of not doing that, and it was, like, the best year of my life. So then I went back to it a bit. But once we had our first kid, I'm like, I'm gonna have to kick this habit again. And I've never gone back. So it was like, three and a half years ago, and it's just like, my wife and I, we don't. She's one of these people that can have, like, a bite of a chocolate chip cookie and be like, wow, that was incredible. I'm like, what do you mean? You're not eating six of them? So I've kind of learned from her with that. And because she was strong with it and didn't need tv, her and I, it shifted.

[00:24:50.240] - Speaker 1
We're obsessed with the kids. There's nothing I could buy or do that would replace my time with them. And I used to feel like I had a weird job working from home online, being an online coach. Because I work from home, I film my videos in my yard. I'm much more involved with the kids, and it aligns with exercise. So I'm lucky that my kids and all the time with them, it also aligns with these problems of, how do you raise a kid now to eat healthy food and exercise and these kind of things? My worlds are blending of adult knees and longevity also with youth exercise. And how do you do that? In a way? And we were, I don't know when we started rural, but, yeah, my wife and I, we bought some land where we could afford to get some land, and we're building a schoolhouse.

[00:25:36.700] - Speaker 2
Great.

[00:25:37.300] - Speaker 1
So that other local kids will want to come over, maybe 1020 kids. With my kids, I want to home school, but I don't want them to be, quote unquote, homeschooled, small class type environment. And my wife and I are going to be running the school.

[00:25:51.450] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:25:52.110] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:25:52.910] - Speaker 2
And hopefully you'll come up with a curriculum that you'll also be able to share with everybody.

[00:25:56.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I love sharing it. So I already put out my first proposed exercise routine.

[00:26:00.890] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:26:01.250] - Speaker 1
So I have, like, on my instagram, YouTube. I call the school common sense university. Common sense u with like the letter u.org. i'm keeping everything there for free. So, like, people can go right now and see my kids workout system free. The kids stuff will always be free.

[00:26:18.090] - Speaker 2
Sounds great.

[00:26:18.910] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:26:20.420] - Speaker 2
How were you first able to get your message out?

[00:26:23.300] - Speaker 1
Let's see. Used instagram. That was the first social media platform used instagram. Tried to just film, get the message out every day.

[00:26:32.390] - Speaker 2
Just showing what you were doing.

[00:26:33.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah. People in person telling me, like, this needs to be common knowledge out there. So I came up with this knees over toes guy name, which to me it was like, if I can just educate on this idea that knee over toes is not just like a blanket bad thing.

[00:26:49.890] - Speaker 2
You called it that because historically we're taught that you never want to have your knees over your toes.

[00:26:57.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:26:58.060] - Speaker 2
Your knees are never supposed to go more than 90 degree. That 90 degree angle. That's what they always teach in physical education.

[00:27:06.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah. There's more pressure on your knee.

[00:27:09.490] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:27:10.050] - Speaker 1
When it goes over your toes. That was found in the seventies.

[00:27:12.310] - Speaker 2
Yes. And that it was dangerous to do.

[00:27:14.510] - Speaker 1
That was the conclusion.

[00:27:15.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah. That was the old thinking, or still the mainstream thinking.

[00:27:19.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You actually had, like, historically, people exercised and actually did plenty of exercises with their knees over their toes when exercise then started becoming a university subject. Like, let's do studies on this. Let's test it. So you have this finding that knee over toes equals more pressure on the knee. So that's a finding. Pressure. Now, there have been long term analysis and it's like, whoops. Actually, people who train that preserve the knee better have less lower body injuries.

[00:27:51.610] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:27:52.450] - Speaker 1
So even academia now, the academic studies show, word for word, contrary to commonly voiced concern.

[00:28:01.660] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:28:02.470] - Speaker 1
But that's what went in is no knees over toast. That's what got entered into the textbooks. So it's this tricky situation now where and lots of professors reach out to me and they tell me that some professors even have to put the notations in the textbook saying, this actually is incorrect. And here's a link to a later study. But the professors also tell me that most professors don't do that. So the majority, if you're in college right now for exercise science, the majority are being taught something that actually has been proven false, and they're being made to believe it, being made to answer it that way on tests in order to graduate and then perpetuating that. So for me, it was like, if I could just get out awareness on that point.

[00:28:45.640] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:28:46.310] - Speaker 1
That would be a worthwhile career.

[00:28:47.680] - Speaker 2
What's also interesting is you had the experience of healing your knees to the point of where I. You got drafted for basketball.

[00:28:56.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:28:56.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. And the same people who drafted you based on the strength of your knees, which were only that way because of the. Your workouts.

[00:29:06.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:29:07.160] - Speaker 2
Then told you you're not allowed to do those workouts.

[00:29:09.960] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:29:10.290] - Speaker 2
Is that really a true story?

[00:29:11.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So I went. I got a scholarship to a junior college.

[00:29:15.510] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:29:15.820] - Speaker 1
It's a two year college.

[00:29:16.770] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:29:17.190] - Speaker 1
They didn't have a strength department. I remember early on, like, an assistant coach, of course, told me, no knees over toes. Can't bend your knee deep below 90 degrees. And I had to follow those instructions, but they didn't really keep up a strength system. There was no strength coach for the team, just a cheaper two year school. So by my second year, I was able to do my own workouts, and I got a lot of heat for it. At first, my teammates didn't like the fact that I wasn't doing the team workouts. I would then invite teammates to go with me to show them, like, how hard I was training. It took time to build up respect of the coach. Like, they knew I was doing my knees over toes workouts, but the rest of the team, like, I wasn't doing some of those team workouts, and those kept me so healthy. I didn't miss a game. Without the knees over toes, I wouldn't have been. You wouldn't call a team. Right. And I helped my team win two straight conference titles. I've been super close with the head coach to this day, and I actually then went back after graduating and actually implemented this stuff with the teams.

[00:30:18.600] - Speaker 1
They've been one of the most successful junior college teams in the country, to the point that that head coach is now a head division one coach.

[00:30:24.770] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:30:25.260] - Speaker 1
At a four year school.

[00:30:26.190] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:30:26.820] - Speaker 1
And they'll keep doing knees over toes there. But the majority of college graduates, and to be at a four year college, you now have a strength coach who's certified. And so they're certified and told, no knees over toes. So it's like I was being told, well, yeah, you're not going to be allowed to do knees over toes here. And it's like. But that's what got me here. It's a true story. And concurrent with that, I was 23 years old by that point because it took me some years after high school to fix my knees, to then even try to go to college. So NCAA Division one denied my eligibility to play. I was too old to play. So I could either get a lawyer and fight it, I got a division one full ride division one scholarship, or I could play division two. But whether it was division one or division two, they weren't going to let me do knees over toes. And it was the summertime. I was already training kids, helping kids get out of knee pain, helping other high school players fix their knee pain. So when my eligibility was denied, I was like, I'm meant to start coaching people.

[00:31:26.050] - Speaker 1
I don't want to go through another two years of trying to train behind the coaches back. It wasn't fun. I wasn't trying to be different from the team, and so I just been training people ever since.

[00:31:39.800] - Speaker 2
Have you noticed any other discrepancies in what's taught in the textbooks? Not just knees over toes, any other things that you do that's a little different?

[00:31:52.880] - Speaker 1
Everything that you're told not to do?

[00:31:56.770] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:31:58.090] - Speaker 1
There's got to be some context, meaning your body, it's not made a certain way, and it's like, whoops, well, don't move it that way. Whatever your body could move, it's meant to do. That's okay. Yeah, that was a huge eye open for me as I kept going and going and going. It's like, I don't believe there's a bad exercise. Every day people ask me, oh, I see this video says, this is bad, or, you shouldn't do this for your shoulders. It's all context. The exercise landscape would be much better if every trainer understood that any natural human movement you can do is fine. Then there's context, like how a sled you could load with weight, and it's fundamentally pretty safe. Like, that's context. It doesn't mean that heavy weight, bad, heavy weight, good, lightweight, is it. Should body weight only or it's all context? Yeah, weights, machines, body weight, pressing over your head, rounding your spine, twisting your spine, anything you could possibly do with your body is all context. And overall, I would say it's like wherever your body has limitations, in my opinion, there hasn't been enough time, first the studies to be done and so on.

[00:33:07.440] - Speaker 1
But without question, in my experience, it's like wherever someone has limitation is where they're gonna have the most problems. So you would almost want to find, rather than avoiding that thing, find what level could they do at that thing and then build from there. Some people have had to walk backward in a pool. It was too much for them to walk backward on land. But rather than saying don't do that, it's like, well, at what level could you do that?

[00:33:30.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Describe the different exercises that are in your mind. The key exercises. What are the handful that would probably benefit most people?

[00:33:42.340] - Speaker 1
Right. To mind jumps. And I make the most videos on these island. We've already covered the sledding and then.

[00:33:49.890] - Speaker 2
Or the backwards treadmill, which sounds great.

[00:33:52.570] - Speaker 1
Sled or resisted treadmill. And there are other brands of resisted treadmills, Jim, models that are 5000 $10,000. I was just trying to make a cheaper one for home use. But again, where's the resistance is from under your foot, like the resistance is the ground itself rather than bearing down on you. So to me that category of exercise huge, where you're resisting from the ground with slider, resisted treadmill, to me that's number one. And then to me number two is, for lack of a better term, stretch strength. So the bulk of the quote unquote weightlifting I do, if someone looked at it, it would be like, is that a strength exercise? Yeah. Is he stretching right now? Yeah, I'm stretching and strengthening at the exact same time. And so a classic one is a split squat, but where your front leg is going all the way down. Like a deep squat on the front leg.

[00:34:44.940] - Speaker 2
So when you say squat, I think of feet together but going down, it's not that, it's more like a lunge.

[00:34:51.820] - Speaker 1
It's like. Exactly, it's like a lunge but where your front leg is all the way down deep. Your front leg, where your front knee.

[00:35:01.640] - Speaker 2
Goes as far forward as it can.

[00:35:04.300] - Speaker 1
And your butt drops. So the front leg is in a deep squat and the back leg is stretching like you feel the front of your hip muscles stretching.

[00:35:12.880] - Speaker 2
So the back knee doesn't go down to the ground.

[00:35:15.780] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Doesn't touch.

[00:35:16.890] - Speaker 2
Right. So the front of the leg, the front of the back leg stretches.

[00:35:20.930] - Speaker 1
Yep, that's right.

[00:35:22.200] - Speaker 2
While the front leg is knees over toes.

[00:35:26.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:35:26.660] - Speaker 2
And your butt gets as close to that front foot as possible, I assume.

[00:35:30.770] - Speaker 1
That's right. And the average person is not going to be able to do that standing on the ground. That's a good goal to get to. Like for my mom, she's 70, she's worked her way to where she can do that and now it's like, mom, maintain that the rest of your life and you're like way ahead of the game. But the more you elevate the front foot, the easier it gets to do the exercise. And then you can put stuff near you for assistance. So you have with this exercise, which, like you were saying, you could call it a deep lunge. Yeah, it's a deep lunge in place. Like, you're not a walking lunge. You're staying in the same spot. The front leg, you're going as deep as you can. The back leg, you're stretching as much as you can. And then you could have assistance. You could do, like, less than your body's weight, and you can elevate the front foot, which requires less flexibility. The lower you go requires more flexibility, and then you could remove the assistance. So you're doing your own body weight, and you could even add weight. So for me, I use about 45 pounds in each hand, flat on the ground, no apparatus needed, and just dropped down into this deep lunge.

[00:36:37.980] - Speaker 1
But I had to start with my front foot elevated, assisting myself to balance. My mom had to start that way. So my goal is doing it weighted. My mom's goal is just maintaining her body weight. My wife is a figure skater, so she actually then elevates her back foot for even more stretch. Cause she has to go around on the ice holding up a leg in a splits. I can do a splits. She has to be able to do it beyond splits, at least for her figure skating goals. It's not a one size fits all kind of thing. It has many different levels and different ways people could do it. But that was the one after the idea of strengthening from the ground up with slider resisted treadmill, this idea of stretch strength, strengthening my muscles through full ranges of motion, stretching, strengthening at the same time, that had the most powerful effects to then keep me off painkillers. So, like, I've never gone back. I haven't. Ten plus years without a setback. And that's, without question, is the biggest reason why.

[00:37:33.770] - Speaker 2
Amazing. So split squats is a good one.

[00:37:36.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And we just call it ATG split squat.

[00:37:38.810] - Speaker 2
What does ATG mean?

[00:37:40.160] - Speaker 1
ATG has always been the term for astrograss, meaning like, a deep squat. So it's like, do you squat to, you know, 90 degrees, or do you squat ass to grass? And so in trying to give it a name that people would understand.

[00:37:52.450] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:37:52.990] - Speaker 1
Just called it. And then a split squat refers to a lunge where you're in place.

[00:37:57.300] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:37:57.840] - Speaker 1
A lunge typically refers like you're moving, you're covering distance, whereas a split squat is just an in place lunge. So an ATG split squat is then an ass to grass split squat on the front foot.

[00:38:08.470] - Speaker 2
Is it okay if the heel comes.

[00:38:09.920] - Speaker 1
Off the ground totally fine.

[00:38:11.310] - Speaker 2
I does it matter?

[00:38:12.630] - Speaker 1
So, like, if someone were to squat down right now and keep their heels down, yes, there's going to be more pressure in the back, and that's fine. Like, there's different exercises you can do to build the back. If you think about a power lifter squatting a thousand pounds, the heels are down. They're not, like, up on their tippy toes. The heels are down, and more weight shifts to the back. But then as you lift your heels, maybe you think about, like, a dancer doing some deep move where the knees are way over the toes and the heels are lifted. The back is no longer the limiting factor. The legs and the knees are the limiting factor. So in any squat, whether a split squat or regular squat, there's no good or bad. It's just different context. The more the heels are down, the more you're going to be training the hips. And then the more the heel is up, the more the load is going to go to the knee. So some people find different comfort of what they like. Some people mix it up. I mix it up. I do both. So heel up, more knee, heel down, more hip.

[00:39:08.830] - Speaker 2
I remember at least in the seventies, I don't know if it's still the case that basketball players wore high top sneakers.

[00:39:17.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:39:18.310] - Speaker 2
Is the idea of a high top getting support of the ankle a good idea or a bad idea?

[00:39:24.830] - Speaker 1
Well, Kobe was really the innovator on this, at least as far as I can see on having a high top basketball shoe. Sounds like it would protect the ankle. But an ankle sprain is so much force, there's not evidence that a high top protects the ankle better. A low top means that your general ankle is going to be stronger. So the more high top, the weaker the ankle is going to be. And if you do sprain, that fabric is not necessarily enough to prevent it from spraining. Yeah. So Kobe went to a low top shoe. I like a low top shoe. At the end of the day, what's.

[00:39:59.150] - Speaker 2
Popular now in best low top? Yeah, everybody.

[00:40:02.300] - Speaker 1
I wouldn't say everybody, but I've done surveys on this with my buddies and stuff because it's like, man, it seems like people really like the Kobe shoes more. And, yeah, the average basketball player, like the majority prefer what Kobe really popularized, which was a lower top basketball shoe, and he didn't even like as big of a heel cushion. That was like a marketing thing. It was kind of like, we need a good idea. And it came from a guy in NASA who's like, all right, let's put air in the heel of a shoe. It didn't come from someone who plays basketball. A guy from NASA came up with the idea of, like, putting air in the heels of basketball shoes. The study done on that shows you're four times more likely to sprain your ankle. You don't jump off the heels, you jump off the balls of the feet. And just elevating a basketball shoe upward, higher off the ground, that means when you do roll your ankle, it's just a more massive sprain. So Kobe not only wanted low top, he then didn't want the giant cushion in the heel. So you're actually. The heel is lower to the ground.

[00:40:56.660] - Speaker 1
The ball of the foot is still about the same spot. The ball of the foot was never elevated super high as the heel elevated super high. So he really had, like, a common sense basketball shoe, in my opinion.

[00:41:05.340] - Speaker 2
Did you ever read born to run?

[00:41:07.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:41:08.840] - Speaker 2
That talked about most running injuries are due to shoes and the fact that they're not made as if you were running barefoot.

[00:41:19.050] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Running barefoot, let's say, in grass.

[00:41:21.800] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:41:22.480] - Speaker 1
You might have, like, a natural running pattern.

[00:41:24.480] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:41:25.420] - Speaker 1
But now if you're running on concrete, obviously barefoot, you don't want to step on something. So concrete's not natural, but neither would, like, a giant shoe be natural. So I just think for most people, it's going to be somewhere in the middle. I like to wear something like, when I'm playing basketball. Well, I'm on a hardwood floor. I can't wear a pure barefoot shoe on a hardwood basketball because the hardwood is not natural.

[00:41:49.340] - Speaker 2
Too hard. Yeah.

[00:41:50.230] - Speaker 1
So ideal would be, I mean, before recording, I came early just to go put my feet in the sand.

[00:41:54.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:41:55.270] - Speaker 1
Down the road. It feels incredible.

[00:41:57.230] - Speaker 2
Feels so good.

[00:41:58.160] - Speaker 1
That's something that's natural, but it's not realistic for everyone. So I think people have to find, like, what type of shoe works best for them. And for most people, I found it's going to be something where you have some support, but not, like, extra support. And with running, some people even run barefoot and stuff. There would be a lot of adaptation that would have to occur in the foot, but there's no doubt that barefoot is natural. So then, all right, what surface are you living on in life? Can you stay natural? Do you need some support? How much support?

[00:42:27.300] - Speaker 2
Because concrete's not natural.

[00:42:29.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So it's just, what's your lifestyle? Yeah. The typical workaday businessman shoes. They jammed the toes in so much, my feet were deformed to look exactly like basketball shoes.

[00:42:40.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:42:40.810] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:42:41.750] - Speaker 2
Have you ever tried the yoga toe spreaders?

[00:42:45.250] - Speaker 1
For sure. I even make some. Cause people like those. My least impressive invention is a basketball shoe that is shaped like a foot so it doesn't jam the toe in.

[00:42:54.650] - Speaker 2
Why is that least impressive?

[00:42:56.280] - Speaker 1
Well, cause try explaining to a kid this is a shoe that's shaped like a foot. I mean, shouldn't a shoe be shaped like a foot?

[00:43:02.640] - Speaker 2
You'd think so.

[00:43:03.570] - Speaker 1
Yeah. No, in basketball. So for years and years, I'm like, someone needs to make a basketball shoe that doesn't jam your big toe in, that lets your big toe be straight. So when I play basketball, I put in the big toe spacer, and I wear my shoe that doesn't jam the toe in. And so then when I'm playing on the court, I can actually feel my big toes.

[00:43:20.960] - Speaker 2
Help me.

[00:43:22.410] - Speaker 1
There's even some false data of, like, well, the toes being jammed in gives you, like, a performance. It's just not true. There's no science behind that.

[00:43:30.780] - Speaker 2
No.

[00:43:31.020] - Speaker 1
I'm out there playing dunking. All the dunks you see me do on my page, I'm wearing shoes that don't jam my big toes in. And I've got a big toe spacer for my previously deformed feet. And my toes, my big toes are helping me out. And there's only one guy on earth who's 50 years old and not over six foot who can still dunk a basketball, and he can even do it barefoot.

[00:43:53.170] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:43:53.630] - Speaker 1
And he takes the time to do the exercises and make his toes like, he. He thinks that big toe is his extra little boost.

[00:44:02.050] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:44:02.700] - Speaker 1
Not to mention for health reasons. Kadur Ziani. French guy, one of the smartest people I've met. Huge heart. And so, look, if he doesn't need to jam in his big toes and he's 50 years old, dunking a basketball, like, you don't have to jam in your big toes.

[00:44:19.780] - Speaker 2
Are your shoes available?

[00:44:21.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, I I saw them. I call it. We call it the uncivilized sneaker.

[00:44:25.160] - Speaker 2
That sounds great.

[00:44:25.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's been a great business. Great sneaker business is super fun. Super awesome.

[00:44:30.030] - Speaker 2
They're comfy to wear. Do you wear them every workout?

[00:44:32.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, when I. I try to just be barefoot or, like, Birkenstock, something. Like, just. Those don't jam in the big toes. But, like, at home, I'm just barefoot. I work out a lot barefoot. But depending on what I'm doing, like, if I'm going to be, like, sledding hard or I. Anything that I do, then want to wear shoes. That's all I wear. So I'm either Birkenstocks or the uncivilized sneaker or barefoot. That's it.

[00:45:03.960] - Speaker 2
Let's continue on the exercises. So sled's number one split squats is number two.

[00:45:09.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Stretch strength, which you could apply for all sorts of areas of your body.

[00:45:12.420] - Speaker 2
What would be the next one up?

[00:45:13.630] - Speaker 1
I would go right from there. It's like I think of it on the order of, if you abbreviated it, sled stretch strength. No weak links. Meaning there are some things that, because gyms were not set up a certain way, that almost everyone has certain muscles that just were missed out on.

[00:45:29.160] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:45:29.650] - Speaker 1
So one I talk about a lot is the tibialis muscle, the anterior tibialis. That means anterior front, and tibialis means of the shin bone. The tibia is the shin bone. So it's not your calf muscles. It's on the other side of. And so, like, if you went into a gym right now and you said, where's the calf machine? They would show you to a standing or seated calf machine. But then if you said, where's the tibialis machine? Like, I want to do the opposite. I train my biceps and my triceps. I want to train my calves and my tips. I train my chest and my back. You got the front and the back. So most people have built up and they don't train that muscle. And so when it comes to, okay, we're sledding now. We're getting stretch strength, going deep leg work. Well, I was still having some major shin problems. Like, I was powering up my legs, and even my calves were getting stronger. My feet were getting stronger from the sledding. I was doing calf raises, but I just kept having shin problems. And so it was really frustrating to, like, have finally overcome my knees and then sometimes to try to go play basketball and have debilitating shin pain to where I have to stop playing because my shins are hurting so bad.

[00:46:33.960] - Speaker 1
Like, what the heck? And it's because I was coming from such a fragile body. Now I'm building all these other muscles. So I created this huge discrepancy that the front of my shin, the tibialis muscle, was never trained. So it's super underdeveloped, starts under the knee, wraps around to the inside of the shin. So adding that to the formula, and, like, I've never looked at it.

[00:46:53.640] - Speaker 2
And what's the exercise?

[00:46:55.280] - Speaker 1
You can do it with a wall, so you don't need any equipment. You have a wall and your butt's against the wall and your legs are in front of you and you raise your toes. So it's like a reverse calf raise. Yeah, but do that 25 times, you're on fire. So you can do it that way without any equipment. And then I was desiring, though, like some sort of measurement, like, all right, these other exercises, we have weights. There's measurement. And there was a guy who had created a bar to strengthen the tibialis. So you put weights on it, you sit on a bench and you're able to do reverse calf raises at the bar. And weights, there's weights hanging down. And they were no longer being produced. He passed away. Self proclaimed bad businessman. Really should have turned it into a business. I would love to be, like, paying him royalties on it or something. So I started making videos saying I was, like, strapping stuff to my feet. I was taping or banding weights to my feet. An equipment company reached out, said, what needs to exist that doesn't? I said, this bar needs to be revived.

[00:47:54.390] - Speaker 1
And they did that. I wasn't involved in the business of it whatsoever. There's now you can go on Amazon and type tib bar, and there's like dozens of sellers and they're not mine. I make one. Yeah, I do have my own now. Yeah, it's like a category now. Tibar. Yeah. For the average person, that's going to be really helpful. And if you think about longevity and having more strength coming from, from those lower leg muscles, this is very helpful for the rest of your life, to be stronger down low, lower towards your ankle and knee. So I would say sled ATG, split squat tibialis would be the three most common that I've seen. The average person has, like, some gains that they haven't tapped into.

[00:48:33.840] - Speaker 2
Upper body.

[00:48:35.520] - Speaker 1
Upper body. I train the same style of, like, the stretch and the strength. So when I press dumbbells, like, I don't stop the dumbbells at my chest, I turn my wrist so that the dumbbells can keep stretching down without touching my body. Pull ups, hanging, that stuff is great. Like, I like to do pull ups through a full range of motion or have people hang. So I've seen great results for the upper body with that, too. But it's not like I was a baseball player with elbow or shoulder surgeries. So the upper body, I keep similar principles as the lower body, but I definitely don't do as much content on it because I'm not trying to claim stuff I haven't experienced.

[00:49:14.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:49:14.810] - Speaker 1
So I've seen good results with the same philosophies. Stretch strength, no weak lengths in the upper body. Okay. A lot of people bench press good idea to strengthen the muscles on the opposing side. I think it's all pretty common sense in the upper body. Definitely take some heat sometimes. Like, if I show using full range of motion, the upper body, there's similar limiting beliefs of, like, oh, you're not supposed to bend the elbows deep or you're not supposed to do full range of motion with the upper body, but I don't think that's the case.

[00:49:41.860] - Speaker 2
So as a rule, full range of motion seems good. It's called full range of motion because it's natural.

[00:49:47.590] - Speaker 1
I think it's outstanding. And it just may mean learning new techniques that you haven't seen people doing in the gym. So, I mean, it's, it's different. And that can be, like, a little bit scary at first.

[00:49:56.670] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:49:57.000] - Speaker 1
But short term, you're maybe using a little less weight or looking a little differently, but long term, to build a more protected body. And if, if the studies on the lower body show that the fuller range of motion equals more protection, I can't imagine that. Then for the elbows, the shoulders, and I've had similar success. There's tons of success stories of people using these same principles for the elbows, the shoulders, the spine, and having really life changing results. People who have had debilitating problems with the back or the shoulders.

[00:50:25.440] - Speaker 2
And it seems like if you were training in a limited way in the gym, but then in a real world situation, you had to stretch in a different way because of the whatever thing you're dealing with, you wouldn't really be prepared. It seems like full range emotion is life.

[00:50:42.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's how I view it.

[00:50:44.140] - Speaker 2
Tell me about flexibility. Why is it important? Is it as important as strength?

[00:50:50.460] - Speaker 1
Yin yang, baby.

[00:50:51.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:50:52.370] - Speaker 1
Youth is flexibility. Adulthood, then, is strength. What's aging? Loss of both. So to me, what I see the best longevity results is training those two concepts in harmony, the strength and the flexibility. It's not which is better or it's not. Just be flexible, but don't be strong, or be strong but not flexible. I'm particularly obsessed with this stretch strength where you're training both at the same time. You're not using an amount of weight that causes you to stop short. Like, if you load enough, you won't be able to use your full flexibility. And you're not stretching beyond a point that you're strong. You're not forcing yourself past a stretch that you're not strong in that position. So everything I do, I don't personally do any passive stretches. I use the strength through my flexibility and I've seen even if someone wants to add more stretching to that, they totally could. But, like, I can do the splits and you can definitely get to some excellent levels of flexibility with stretch strength training.

[00:51:57.410] - Speaker 2
You always do them together.

[00:51:58.970] - Speaker 1
That's right, yeah. And if there's not a convenient way to add weights, it's more like I'm in a position where I'm stretching, but I'm not just passively there, I'm like actively strengthening the muscles against a pad or whatever it is.

[00:52:11.010] - Speaker 2
Is there a bodyweight only version for every exercise if you don't have any equipment?

[00:52:16.580] - Speaker 1
As far as I've seen, yeah, pretty dang close to it. Again, doesn't mean that body weight's better, but it's sure cool that it's accessible.

[00:52:24.230] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. If you happen to be in a situation where you don't have any equipment and you still want to be able to do it, seems good.

[00:52:30.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, sometimes it's a great way to learn too, because you can't rush the process. You're like trying to own your body. I think it's fantastic. Huge fan of bodyweight training and yeah, I relentlessly try. In any newer video people are going to see of me, you're gonna see me taking a lot of time to show context, to show how to do it with body weight.

[00:52:48.700] - Speaker 2
That's great.

[00:52:49.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I have a whole, my whole kid system, all ten steps. You don't need any weights. Like, it's all body weight.

[00:52:55.110] - Speaker 2
And can adults do the kid system as well?

[00:52:57.400] - Speaker 1
Well, I do. I mean, people are texting me saying, hey, my whole family just did the CSU workout, the CSU fitness regimen. So, yeah, the CSU fitness regimen is free. Spend hours and hours to try to make it just as fast to learn for people as possible. And it's like a ten step workout that your kids could do. You could do it with them. And, yeah, it's body weight. It doesn't mean that, that you couldn't add weights to it, but it's like, yeah, it's a body weight system. Why not master your body? You're young. Master your body weight at a young age. It's fantastic. You still have time to then learn how to add weights.

[00:53:28.330] - Speaker 2
Best foot exercises.

[00:53:31.050] - Speaker 1
Not going to claim to be an expert there. I will say that the fact of starting with the slider resisted treadmill, you're really engaging those foot structures.

[00:53:39.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:53:40.420] - Speaker 1
So I think there's a lot more that someone could add for themselves. I try to keep almost, like, what's the least number of tools that I need?

[00:53:47.790] - Speaker 2
Yep.

[00:53:48.390] - Speaker 1
When you're pushing through, I think of it like a big three. If you're pushing through those foot structures with the slider resisted treadmill, if you're training your calves and your tibialis, the calf muscles, those run really deep. The tibialis runs really deep and even attaches to the inside of the foot. Boy, you're doing those three things. The majority of people are going to be symptom free, are going to have really good feet. So it's like, all right, if we can do those basics and the average person can have great feet, that doesn't mean there might not be further value. But, like, that's what I've lived, that's what I've experienced, that's what I've coached thousands of times.

[00:54:19.580] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:54:19.920] - Speaker 1
I can't really see myself going beyond that in terms of what I coach.

[00:54:23.810] - Speaker 2
Anything specific for the toes or that's.

[00:54:26.170] - Speaker 1
Also, again, I think that just goes.

[00:54:28.050] - Speaker 2
It's built in.

[00:54:28.790] - Speaker 1
Like, my thoughts on it are, like, I wish every gym had, like, a big sand pit or something. I mean, it's so amazing when you're in really good sand, your feet are doing all these things that might take just lots of complexity to do. And bear in mind, for me, when I work out, it's the same process every time. If I'm in a gym with a sled, great. If I'm at home, I've got my resisted treadmill. Within 60 seconds, I'm huffing and puffing. My legs are on fire. So I only know lace up, start workout. Within 60 seconds, I'm huffing and puffing. My legs are burned like I'm working out.

[00:55:07.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:55:07.620] - Speaker 1
So for me, the idea of doing further toe drills, I do that, then I train my ankles. So when I do the tibialis and the calves, not only do those get a good burn, I'm still catching my breath from the sledd. And then by then, I'm already into the deep legwork. So it's like everything I do is metabolically really demanding. It's a workout like, 2030 minutes of this, you could get a full body workout. There's nothing I do that's, like, just a drill. That's not metabolically so. I feel like someone, if they have the time and the desire, there's so many great resources these days. The foot collective on instagram, there's dedicated pages. Just as I put out what I know for free. There's dedicated pages putting out more data on the foot. So for a lot of people, that might be like, if the basics don't cover it, maybe get even more ability for the area. It's just I. I'm not gonna try to be an expert on something that I haven't had to really master.

[00:56:07.080] - Speaker 2
And.

[00:56:07.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, sand. One day we gotta have sand in every gym.

[00:56:09.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:56:10.420] - Speaker 1
Have sled. Have sand, Manda.

[00:56:12.810] - Speaker 2
And you don't need that much sand, right. Because you could do it in place. Do you think most of the sand.

[00:56:17.020] - Speaker 1
Stuff, like, I think it's a cool idea. Just like walking in sand. I don't know. Maybe they could make, like, giant treadmills that just kind of slowly. Just like, slow. And then you just go, take a walk in this. I don't know. I mean, who knows what people can come up with? But I've always been like, man, it'd be so cool if there was some way to get sand.

[00:56:37.400] - Speaker 2
What's the equivalent of walking in Sandhya?

[00:56:40.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:56:40.670] - Speaker 2
In a treadmill like experience. That's a good, that's a good problem.

[00:56:43.770] - Speaker 1
To see for a walk. But, you know, it's, you get outside in the sun, walking in actual sand, there's so many benefits. So maybe it's like, maybe the real solution there is find the best grass or sand near you, and heck, if you're in Minnesota. That's really how the backward treadmill thing came about, because I was making a sled with these really brilliant family with a factory in Minnesota, and they're like, well, we can't use the sled most of the year. It's freezing outside.

[00:57:09.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:57:10.050] - Speaker 1
So we started making a backward treadmill. So I feel like, for northern climates. Yeah, I think you gotta get some sand in there.

[00:57:16.120] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:57:16.840] - Speaker 1
Somehow.

[00:57:17.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think in your case, this also, you have incredible dedication. You'll work at something for years and years and years and years to get the results you want. You're tenacious, and I think that's a huge piece of the puzzle of that. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. Doesn't have to be terrible, but you're consistent and you'll show up and you'll do it. Whatever it is.

[00:57:46.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That's often how things get done.

[00:57:48.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:57:48.990] - Speaker 1
You don't know what's on the other side.

[00:57:50.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:57:50.770] - Speaker 1
But, you know, you're gonna keep showing up.

[00:57:52.200] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.

[00:57:52.790] - Speaker 1
The one for me now on that, it's like, I've committed now to putting a schoolhouse.

[00:57:58.440] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:57:58.880] - Speaker 1
And teaching my kid, like, yeah. I'm finally earning the age where they can go to school and I can have the day off for myself. And I'm committing myself, trust me, that's this like huge daunting thing of like, holy shit, there is no free time. It's. I'm now not only a dad, I'm now gonna be educating students and there's a balance. My, I'll do certain things, I'll be more on the physical education side, but this is like, this is what I'm committing to. Will I figure it out? Well, I'll have ten plus years. I believe I can come up with a great youth health system where it doesn't feel forced, where they're self determined, where they understand their body, where they don't feel forced, where they enjoy it. Like, these are the goals I have for it. Well, I'm gonna show up for ten.

[00:58:42.800] - Speaker 2
Plus years and, you know, you have the love and you have the intention, which is probably more than they could get from anyone else in any system. And that's probably, that's the most important part.

[00:58:59.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. The best teachers I had growing up, you could feel the love. It was there, like they really cared about you. And I think there's a lot of rightnesses about the school system, but for me, I couldn't find something that I honestly felt. I am lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm lucky that my job is making videos in my yard.

[00:59:18.430] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:59:18.790] - Speaker 1
I'm not going to squander that. And what else am I going to do now with the time, if my kids are in school during the day, like, I lucked out.

[00:59:26.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:59:27.250] - Speaker 1
I'm either heading towards the next ten years of thinking, ooh, what more business opportunities might there be for me? I found the shit I like to do. Yep, I'm good.

[00:59:35.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:59:36.440] - Speaker 1
Or could I be of more service kids health? You know, what if I look around, what things could I do? I can't see anything that I could be of more potential value than that. So throwing myself in there, great.

[00:59:50.100] - Speaker 2
Sitting behind a desk all day when you're a little kid, that seems insane. That seems like the worst idea.

[00:59:57.940] - Speaker 1
One to one ratio minimum is one of the key principles to me that I refuse to break. I refuse to believe that you have to be in the classroom more than half the time. And I couldn't find a single school system does this well, any that I could find here in the classroom. The majority of the time I went through it, the amount of actual time that I was learning, critical things, I took it seriously, I only got a b one time, all a's. I took it seriously. I did what I was told to do. I can see the areas that really were needed. I think you can get the basics in in less amount of time. I think you only need 40 minutes for a class, not an hour. So I'm doing 40 minutes classes rather than an hour. So you got 20 minutes. Just be a kid 40 minutes focused. I'll bet we can do more than 60 minutes. And then you're just turning over to the next class 40 minutes with a 20 minutes break, and then at least half of the quote unquote classes are not in the classroom. Like, school made me hate reading.

[01:00:56.590] - Speaker 1
So I'm thinking of school not as the end of education. I'm thinking of school as how can I set up the rest of life.

[01:01:05.020] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Creating curiosity, problem solving.

[01:01:08.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah. One of the things that I'm proposing that I'm going to attempt in the school is that when it comes to the reading class, is that the kids pick what they want to read about. I'm sure over ten years of schooling, or whatever it is, I'm going to focus on the six to 14 age. So roughly eight years of. I think in eight years I can get the basics in. I think that's a good amount of time that a kid can become a good reader, a good writer, good at the basics of math. But can you become good at reading and writing by reading and writing about things you're interested in? I think so, yeah.

[01:01:41.510] - Speaker 2
I'll say probably better.

[01:01:44.290] - Speaker 1
That's what I'm hypothesizing. So I'm not saying, yeah, from six to 14, my kids are not going to read. It's like, my goal is actually that my kids will love reading.

[01:01:56.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:01:57.370] - Speaker 1
Because they'll be able to find stuff they want to read about.

[01:02:00.200] - Speaker 2
The reason you were willing to do so much work on yourself was because of your love of basketball.

[01:02:06.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah.

[01:02:08.270] - Speaker 2
And a lot of the work that you were doing wasn't playing basketball. It was training so that you could play basketball the way you wanted to play basketball. If it wasn't for the love of basketball, you would have never put yourself through all that, both learning and physical work.

[01:02:22.220] - Speaker 1
Good point. Yep.

[01:02:23.380] - Speaker 2
It's the same thing.

[01:02:24.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. Another one that Charles poliquin.

[01:02:27.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:02:27.730] - Speaker 1
He said, don't see life through a straw. And he firmly believed in love, meaning, like, it wasn't discipline, it was love. Like you love. You know, it's just semantics. But his viewpoint was like, you love something enough that it makes you appear then disciplined or so on, you know, different ways to think about it. But the point is that, yeah, I think when it comes to reading and writing, I found that I did best when I was reading and writing, things I was interested about. Of course, all of a sudden I was this great reader. Like, when I look back through my schooling, there were times when I was this great reader, but it was because I was actually interested in that book, or I was great at writing, because what I found is I would take every creative writing class I could, but then I hated english class, and now writing has been one of, like, the most helpful parts of my career is writing. But I grew up hating the thought of writing until I found the creative writing classes.

[01:03:24.070] - Speaker 2
Because you got to write about what you were interested in.

[01:03:26.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it just wasn't quite enough creativity, though. It was like, okay, I have to pick creative writing, but now I'm giving up any other art. Like, wait, I can't creative write and do music. There was almost so much time in the day, and so much of it was the stuck in the classroom stuff. I think kids can learn plenty fine balancing up with more time to be a kid. Art, anything creative, playing, athletic, whatever, you know, I think they'll learn a bit better.

[01:03:56.680] - Speaker 2
Has your training, physical training, impacted other areas of your life?

[01:04:02.320] - Speaker 1
I think so. From finding, like, okay, rather than running from the problem, at what level could I face this problem? I know that if there's some issue with my wife to the core of me, I know it's going to work out better to actually bring it up at whatever gentle level rather than avoid it.

[01:04:17.900] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:04:18.160] - Speaker 1
It's like some of the lessons from the training have helped me in life that it's like facing the thing.

[01:04:24.050] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:04:24.650] - Speaker 1
Rather than running from the thing. But not shotgun blasting.

[01:04:28.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Not avoiding.

[01:04:29.940] - Speaker 1
Right. But what level could you approach it that could actually be, like, acceptable.

[01:04:34.780] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:04:35.250] - Speaker 1
And see it. But then what could you build from there?

[01:04:37.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:04:37.720] - Speaker 1
And then before you know it, some subject that was tough or something, all of a sudden that's not like a strength for you. So seeing that could happen, that my knees could go from a weakness to a strength from actually facing them rather than the common advice of avoiding them. But then building that on a step by step level now it's like, yeah, I could be good at anything. I don't know how good I. But I could train to do anything.

[01:04:58.100] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:04:58.370] - Speaker 1
Right. I could become proficient. I could become at a professional level at just about anything now. How good? Not everyone's going to be Michael Jordan but could I actually get good quality skill? I feel like I could learn anything to some level.

[01:05:12.740] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. You could train to do anything and you could train to do anything a lot better than when you start, for sure.

[01:05:18.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:05:18.960] - Speaker 2
Anything.

[01:05:19.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:05:20.320] - Speaker 2
And just the desire and the putting in the work.

[01:05:23.960] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:05:25.190] - Speaker 2
Do you have any revisions of things that maybe in the beginning you did it one way, but you found a better way?

[01:05:33.430] - Speaker 1
I mean, the one that just jumps to my end is like, social media is interesting because the modern algorithms sort of reward arguments in the comments. Like, I used to try to show more flashy things to get attention, like extreme knee exercises, but now it's almost like a challenge. Like, can I, can I make regressions interesting enough that people will watch that?

[01:05:57.000] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:05:57.580] - Speaker 1
So definitely a shift in terms of, like, trying to make it really clear to people, you don't have to try extreme knee exercise. That's not the point of knees over toes. The point is actually regressions. Can I teach that at such quality that I can still get good views and so on? I mean, that's been the biggest difference. Like, it was very easy to, like, just do some freaky knee thing and get views. But you have people in the comments, oh, my gosh, you should never let your, and you let, you know, the people argue and that stokes the out. So now I, it's like, can I actually just put out an educational work and still do fine? And I found, yeah, I can do totally fine. So definitely a revision in terms of, like, people don't have to go to extremes on it. Like, they could apply this at whatever level. And if you do something at high enough quality, you can keep your integrity in.

[01:06:42.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:06:43.420] - Speaker 1
You don't have to sell out to whatever the platform. And that's what I would just tell the young, up and coming content creators is like, you know, sometimes I see it and sometimes I talk to these people and it's not necessarily good for your happiness to, like, change your integrity to get views or make money.

[01:06:59.760] - Speaker 2
That's a really good point. It's one of the things that pushes me away from social media is the sensational nature of it, you know, like showing what's horrifying or the anger or.

[01:07:12.300] - Speaker 1
It'S, and if you can create an argument in the comments, the platforms just give you more and more views.

[01:07:17.390] - Speaker 2
I had no idea.

[01:07:18.510] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, you can.

[01:07:19.150] - Speaker 2
I don't know that.

[01:07:20.090] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Because I try to stay up to date on social media.

[01:07:22.150] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:07:22.710] - Speaker 1
And it's like, I can almost call it one for one. Like, I'll point out to my wife. And she'll be like, oh my gosh, you know this just to stay up to date. Like, what's the editing styles? What's, what's doing? Well, see something viral and she'll be like, oh, wow, that's a great parenting tip. And I'm like, no, no, no. You don't see why it went viral. Wait til you open up the comments. It went viral because it made people angry because of this point. That could be like, you see a mom working hard at home working out, and the baby's nearby, and you go to the comments and it's all people saying, don't lift weights near a baby. And so then you can also see when creators intentionally do stuff like that because they're chasing the views. So social media is interesting that, yes, statistically you could almost manufacture successful views by throwing your integrity out the door. And some of the best content creators I know don't get as much views because there's no argument.

[01:08:19.540] - Speaker 2
They're not playing the game right.

[01:08:20.970] - Speaker 1
If you taught something well enough that there would be no argument in the comments, you get less views.

[01:08:26.030] - Speaker 2
That's shocking. It's really a sad state of the industry.

[01:08:29.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And so then you end up with the masses very confused and taking sides. I mean, it just, it leads to so much taking sides and arguments when it's really the context. And that's why I think, I think this day and age, if you're coming up, you gotta have some sort of advisor. And I don't even mean in person. I mean, all right, someone who listened to this podcast is gonna learn some things that you might not see in a social media video that then might guide you. Then when you're faced with that, that you would go, you know, I'm going to keep my integrity in on this, knowing that I could still get 10,000 views and build up, you know, a legitimate business for myself instead of playing that game. And that would be okay.

[01:09:14.170] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:09:14.490] - Speaker 1
And I could be happier.

[01:09:16.330] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:09:16.930] - Speaker 1
With my integrity in and that the more views doesn't equal more happy, because it actually does.

[01:09:21.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:09:22.400] - Speaker 1
If your integrity goes out for more success on paper, empty, I think your happiness is going down.

[01:09:28.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Tell me about the whole, I know very little about social media. Tell me about your experience from the beginning. What did you learn? What worked, what didn't work from the earliest days?

[01:09:40.560] - Speaker 1
Well, I started just on Instagram.

[01:09:42.500] - Speaker 2
Yep.

[01:09:42.940] - Speaker 1
That was the sort of most known short form platform.

[01:09:46.640] - Speaker 2
And you thought short form's the best way to teach.

[01:09:49.520] - Speaker 1
Just seemed like what the masses were kind of engaging in. I see this was a little bit before TikTok erupted. So at that time, Instagram still had more esthetics. Like, at that time, like, Joe Rogan finding my content blew up my content more than anything I've ever done. Luckiest thing that's happened to my content.

[01:10:08.610] - Speaker 2
It's lucky, but also the content's good. And he recognized something good, so it is lucky that he found it.

[01:10:14.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah, no doubt.

[01:10:15.420] - Speaker 2
But it's not unusual.

[01:10:16.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah, no doubt. I had already helped thousands of people, but at that time, you could put, like, some gorgeous visuals showing, let's say, regressions of form, but you could put a quality thing, and underneath it, you could write something no gimmicks needed, and it could do very well. Then TikTok came about the short video age. It's changed everything. So now Instagram wants reels, which is just a copy of TikTok. And even YouTube now wants shorts, which is just a copy of TikTok. The problem with short video, without then being able to write about it or give longer explanation, it leads to these sort of arguments, and it's, how can you get context across in such a fast video? And then the algorithm is clearly rewarding how many comments and, you know, and so Instagram is mostly a TikTok now, and YouTube is mostly a TikTok now. No matter how much effort I put into long form, all the top views are on short form videos. So for me, it's become a challenge of, like, how do I keep my integrity? How do I give context? How do I not have a single argument in the comments?

[01:11:30.530] - Speaker 1
Can I teach this without a single argument in the comments and have it do well, it's fine.

[01:11:36.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:11:37.300] - Speaker 1
But do I see things that I could go, you know, I could get more views if I did it this way? Yeah. And that's where the maturity has been for me, is seeing that's not actually the right thing to do.

[01:11:47.270] - Speaker 2
You're starting from a solid place and people like your content, so you have. You have an audience.

[01:11:53.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. And if you're trying to provide for your family, you can absolutely do that 100% with your integrity in.

[01:11:59.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:12:00.830] - Speaker 1
Just more views for everyone doesn't necessarily mean a more stable business.

[01:12:05.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:12:06.150] - Speaker 1
And you can see some of these people who become sort of like social media celebrities, and they're just putting their whole life on display and just any possible controvert and calling people out, like, that's one thing. Like, I will never use someone else's name or image to put them down in my podium, ever. Of course, you know, I've been able to talk with a lot of content creators and it doesn't make people happier. I think life has probably always had ways to throw your integrity out.

[01:12:35.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:12:35.870] - Speaker 1
And apparently win more. I think that's maybe that will always be the case. Yeah, I think. Are you trying to win today on paper or are you trying to like win for real long term? And I think it's like, if you.

[01:12:49.910] - Speaker 2
Cheated a game, did you win the game?

[01:12:51.650] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[01:12:52.230] - Speaker 2
I don't know. I don't know if that.

[01:12:53.570] - Speaker 1
Right. What are you playing for exactly? Like, that's. Yeah, so I think there's got, you know, I think if people are going to be on social media, they have to have a purpose for doing it. That has to be about trying to help other people. Because if it's not about helping other people, then I just feel like it can be a slippery slope if it's for the personal gain. I'm sure there are plenty of politicians that they are just feel the need to help other people and they've probably kept their integrity in better than people who are like, I would really like to be in that position of power for my own gain.

[01:13:25.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So what's the best way if I want to learn your teachings?

[01:13:29.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:13:30.170] - Speaker 2
What would you say is the very best way to do it?

[01:13:32.540] - Speaker 1
Well, if you're on X or YouTube or Instagram, that knees over toes guy. Yep. Every week I work to make it as frictionless as possible for you to learn everything I know.

[01:13:43.630] - Speaker 2
If I was starting from scratch.

[01:13:45.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I need the same content, but.

[01:13:47.300] - Speaker 2
Can I start anywhere? Do I have to like go back couple of years? What do you recommend?

[01:13:51.870] - Speaker 1
You can just start right in. I take extensive time to reshow regressions, so you're getting context, you're seeing how to start. And if someone likes to just grab a book, knee ability zero is cheap on Amazon and that would be like a good place to start. But it's not like there's some like secrets in there.

[01:14:11.370] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:14:11.980] - Speaker 1
That are not on social media posts.

[01:14:14.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:14:15.020] - Speaker 1
So I, you know, that is what I work for. Like, I do work for the social medias to be something that anyone knew could open up and get a good idea. I try not to make redundant content, meaning like, if I need to update something, I'll take something down from the past, even if it had a lot of views, if I could teach it a little bit better.

[01:14:35.000] - Speaker 2
Oh, that's great.

[01:14:36.270] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So that when you go to the page, it's like it'll have the up.

[01:14:40.180] - Speaker 2
To date information yeah, that's great.

[01:14:42.150] - Speaker 1
The idea is if you watched a few, like, you're already, like, getting with it. That's what I try to do, at least.

[01:14:47.020] - Speaker 2
Great. What products are you making besides the backwards treadmill? And there's the shoes@gequipment.com.

[01:14:55.310] - Speaker 1
Is really everything. I use all the equipment, I use all the unusual stuff, always working on stuff. So it's like you have the data, but to be able to apply the data, gyms are not necessarily set up this style. So a lot of people are like, hey, I want to make my own home. Little ATG gym, do all the knees over toes guy stuff. So working on everything.

[01:15:14.910] - Speaker 2
Tell me what all the pieces are.

[01:15:16.550] - Speaker 1
I mean, if you go from the ground up, you got, you're pushing through the toes. So I make the backward treadmill.

[01:15:22.240] - Speaker 2
Yep.

[01:15:22.600] - Speaker 1
And I make a sled.

[01:15:23.440] - Speaker 2
Oh, you make a sled.

[01:15:24.110] - Speaker 1
Now make a sled.

[01:15:24.860] - Speaker 2
Great.

[01:15:25.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So make a sled or backward treadmill.

[01:15:27.490] - Speaker 2
Is the sled wheels or first model.

[01:15:30.200] - Speaker 1
Is the one that goes on turf.

[01:15:31.390] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:15:31.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Those are the two that I've used the most. And then you have the bar for strengthening the tibialis muscle, the tib bar. And then you have a slant board. A slant board's a very simple device that can make it easy to stretch or strengthen around your lower body.

[01:15:46.170] - Speaker 2
So would you do squats on the slant board?

[01:15:49.170] - Speaker 1
Squats would be something you can do. Training the calf muscles the other way around would be something you can do, like toe raises. Yeah, yeah. Or even toe touches. But standing on the slant, I see most calf muscles are too tight just from the years of wearing regular shoes.

[01:16:05.750] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:16:06.050] - Speaker 1
And the heels being lifted.

[01:16:07.090] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:16:07.560] - Speaker 1
It's almost like the modern calf is like an inch too tight just from the, from the footwear. And then my personal favorite product I call a mobility box because it makes it user friendly to do those ATG split squats. That's the one that, for me is like, whether you're young or whether you're old or, like, to me, that's, that's the heart of the program for me is the ATG split squat. Like, yeah, but in the gym, like, where's the mobility stuff? You walk into a gym, you usually have tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars of machines. And, like, a paper thin yoga mat in the corner.

[01:16:40.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:16:41.280] - Speaker 1
Mobility actually can be done a lot better, like, in a gym setting. So the mobility box is my personal favorite.

[01:16:47.140] - Speaker 2
And what is that? Explain what it is.

[01:16:48.760] - Speaker 1
It's like, makes it really user friendly to raise the front foot. Anywhere from two to 24 inches with poles to balance. Oh, like. Yeah. So, like, my mom, she would use a stairwell and do the ATG split squat. My dad.

[01:17:00.810] - Speaker 2
Yep.

[01:17:01.530] - Speaker 1
Just skipped it. Yeah, just skipped the ATG split because it just wasn't user friendly.

[01:17:05.610] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:17:06.190] - Speaker 1
Now they have that in the living room now he does it all the time. Loves it because it's user friendly. You can measure, you can see your flexibility progress. You can balance. If you need, you can take the balance off. It's just. It's very simple. And then just more stuff like that. Like there's more mobility. Like, I really think so many people want to be more mobile.

[01:17:22.990] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:17:24.110] - Speaker 1
But then the machinery's not really set up for it.

[01:17:27.490] - Speaker 2
That's great that you're making all this stuff.

[01:17:29.160] - Speaker 1
Thank you. Fun to keep creating. Temporal. Temporal temperament, temporal relative.
