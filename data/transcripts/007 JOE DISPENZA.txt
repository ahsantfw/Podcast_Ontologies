[00:00:02.520] - Speaker 
Tetragrammaton. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around.

[00:00:25.240] - Speaker 1
Okay. Okay. So, um, when I was a kid. Yes, I loved fevers.

[00:00:30.360] - Speaker 2
Having a fever.

[00:00:31.160] - Speaker 1
Having a fever for me was really, really being in the Crucible. It was something that where my body would change its physiology. It changed its temperature. My brain, my brain chemistry must have changed. And I got super lucid. Uh, you know, out of body, um, very interdimensional. And I, I remember very specifically, uh, intentionally not taking the aspirins and the medications when my parents came in and said, you have a fever. I would intentionally not take them so that I could have these these mystical moments. And some of them really had to do with being aware that, uh, that I wasn't the guy that I thought I was, that there were there are other aspects of me that existed simultaneously. And I kind of put that as just a dream. That was a lucid experience. Uh, fast forward to my life now. Um, I actually think those are truly other dimensions that we have access to and to live in those mystical moments, really, that are transcendental, you know, transcendental of space and time.

[00:01:37.340] - Speaker 1
Um, I would have never thought that as a kid, but my experience now is that I actually believe it's the truth.

[00:01:43.500] - Speaker 2
I never thought of this before you said that, um, that I think of fevers as a natural reaction in the body to fight some something that's going on. And I never thought of the mental aspect of it as maybe having some purpose. But now hearing you say that, I wonder, is that part of, uh, the the genius of the way the human works is that we can see things when we have a fever that we can't see otherwise. Yeah. It's interesting.

[00:02:17.360] - Speaker 1
I think that may may be the truth. I used to call them fever dreams. Yeah.

[00:02:21.480] - Speaker 2
And I knew so many musicians who've written their best songs. Willie Nelson wrote three of his best songs with 105 fever in one day.

[00:02:28.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I totally get that. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:02:31.920] - Speaker 2
Amazing. Amazing. And so I'm just thinking it'd be interesting to look into what it could be. What what is it telling us? And again, never thought about it before. I thought about the fact that it happens, but I never thought about, oh, this might actually be an intentional thing. This is a feature, not a bug.

[00:02:52.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. And and and what is the latent system in system in the brain? Yes. What is that latent system? That's that. Once activated, opens the door to other dimensions. That there must be some brain chemistry change. There must be some change in mind. There must be some suppression of certain common neural activity. Yes. And I really. This is. Well, let's go then. Let's let's talk about this because, um, when we look at our functional brain scans of people that are in the midst of a lucid moment, a mystical experience, let's just let's just call it that. Um, you have different brain waves, right? And we're just kind of interacting and we're talking right now and we're in beta brainwave patterns. You know, the brain's got to create meaning in order between what's going on in our inner world and what's going on in our outer world. And there's a lot of sensory information that the brain has to integrate. And so the meaning between the inner and the outer world through our senses causes our brain to have a certain level of awareness.

[00:03:53.500] - Speaker 1
And that's that's called beta. You get kind of dreamy. You get kind of imaginative. You kind of relax a little bit and kind of the voice in your head stops talking to you that that default and the brain kind of sees in pictures and images. It's an imaginary state. And that's alpha, right. And so that's when our inner world is a little bit more real than our outer world. Right. So in beta, our outer world tends to be more real. And that's a good place to be when you want to learn, when you want to create. Um, but we've discovered that when people really can get super, super relaxed to the point where their body's resting in a light sleep, it's kind of asleep, but the person's conscious and awake, that's theta. And theta is a very little activity in the thinking brain. So the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind opens wide open. And what separates that is the analytical mind. And that's where you can reprogram something.

[00:04:50.280] - Speaker 1
Right? Because the doors are open now. So in theta, you're in a hypnotic state and you're suggestible to information. So suggestibility is your ability to accept, believe and surrender to information without analyzing it. And you think it's the truth. And actually programs that autonomic nervous system, that automatic system to make a pharmacy of chemicals that support the very, the very thought that you're thinking. So in theta then in that hypnotic state, a hypnotist can program people to do certain things because they're actually in that very suggestible state. What we discovered, though, is that when people can get into the state where they're relaxed in their heart, it's the best way that I can describe this, and the body feels safe enough that it can move out of the the moment of survival, where it's always trying to anticipate the next moment based on the past, that it's preoccupied, that if the person can really relax into that present moment, the body starts feeling really rested and starts to trust. Um, and the person's eyes are closed and there's music filling the space.

[00:05:53.350] - Speaker 1
They forgot about the person sitting next to them. They forgot about the pain in their back. Um, they're there and they take their attention off of everything, physical and material, and they begin to just open up to energy, to frequency and, uh, and become kind of a level of awareness that's transcendental. Transcendental of anything material and physical. We would say we're pure consciousness. There's only one other place information can come from when it's not coming through your senses. And that's from this field of information. So to answer your question, we started seeing the brain going to these super aroused states. And the arousal wasn't pain. The arousal wasn't fear, the arousal wasn't anger or aggression. The arousal was ecstasy. And the autonomic nervous system. Right. There was we're talking about a fever now, that area of the brain. is extremely hot and it moves into these very, very elegant, very high states of gamma brainwave patterns. Not a little gamma, not a lot of gamma, not a whole lot of gamma, a supernatural amount of gamma.

[00:07:03.330] - Speaker 1
The whole autonomic nervous system is oscillating at a very, very fast, coherent frequency. And like like tuning a tuning fork, the autonomic nervous system starts moving into resonance into order. And somehow a latent system in the brain opens up. And now that person is like a radio receiver. They're transducing information from the field into profound imagery and epiphany a download and understanding of vision. Some integration happens in that moment, and they're in a world tends to be more real than their outer world, and they're having a full on sensory experience without their senses. And that subjective experience being captured Objectively and the amount of energy in the autonomic nervous system, not only the amount of energy, but the amount of order. The autonomic nervous system is touching every single cell in the body. And so now the nervous system is sending coherent information to all the cells in the body. And that feels like love, that feels like ecstasy, that feels like bliss. So in a sense, the way the fever occurs when a person is in that heightened state where the autonomic nervous system is really hot and the body is really hot.

[00:08:15.430] - Speaker 1
I think it mimics that kind of state where a person can really start connecting to information that's beyond their senses, that they're in that world of half awake and half asleep. They're there in that place where, um, the door is wide open.

[00:08:30.030] - Speaker 2
Is this different than the dream state in sleep?

[00:08:33.270] - Speaker 1
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. You see the gamma brainwave patterns, and the person is extremely awakened. Like the arousal that's producing that feeling of ecstasy, of bliss is actually causing you to put all of their attention on whatever's going on in their mind, you know? And so, in a sense, their inward experience is rewriting circuitry in the brain. And the end product of an experience is an emotion, but the emotion isn't. The emotions were typically used to this is this is order. This is coherence. The best way to describe it is love, or pure love or ecstasy or bliss or whatever you want to call that. And so when the person comes back, I believe, to three dimensional reality, their spectrum of what they perceive as broad and we don't see things how they are, we see things how we are right. And so now their brain is wired actually to perceive a little bit more of reality, a little bit more beauty and reality, a little bit some veil, some conditioning, some illusion.

[00:09:35.930] - Speaker 2
So the outside, the outside isn't changing. We can just see it better, we can see it more clearly and some of our self-talk or story is removed to get closer to heaven on earth.

[00:09:50.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And, uh, so, so the person who's had a turbulent past that has been abused, um, that has had series of traumas in their life and those emotions cause them to remember their past in that moment. The body is feeling so amazing that it's literally dragging the body right out of the past to the person that somehow has some type of upgrade in their biology, some type of transformation, some type of healing, some type of the story is no longer the same story. They don't they're not telling that story because the emotion has been removed. They see it from wisdom. They they look back at their past and they say, I actually don't want to change anything in my past. I would have never got to this moment if I didn't have those experiences. And so there's a forgiveness that takes place from the past, and now I think the person starts really, really seeing a greater aspect of reality.

[00:10:48.970] - Speaker 2
Are the memories held in the body?

[00:10:53.130] - Speaker 1
Oh, okay. Let's talk. I would love to talk about this. Um, okay. So, um, the stronger the emotion that we feel to some problem, some condition, some experience in our life, the more altered we feel inside of us. You know, when we're changed, that change in our emotional state captures the brain's entire attention, and we start paying attention to whatever it is in our outer world that's causing us to feel that way. We get a.

[00:11:22.090] - Speaker 2
Very narrow focus.

[00:11:23.010] - Speaker 1
We get a very narrow focus, and the brain actually takes a snapshot. And that's called the long term memory. And so then people think neurologically within the, the, the experience and they feel chemically within the boundaries of that emotion. How you think and how you feel creates your state of being. Now the problem is, is that information now is wired in the brain. But every time they remember the event, every time they're review the experience, they're producing the same chemistry in their brain and body as if the event was occurring. So their their body is reliving the past experience 100 times in one day. Okay. So take a thought and a feeling. Take an image, a memory and an emotion. Take a stimulus and response. And now you're conditioning the body to actually live in that emotional state 24 hours a day. Now, the trauma is not just in the brain. The trauma is actually in the body, and the body is the unconscious mind. It's it's the objective mind. It does not know the difference between the real life experience that's creating that emotion and the emotion that that person is fabricating by memory and memory and by thought alone.

[00:12:41.440] - Speaker 1
The body is believing it's living in that same life over and over again. So now what's the relevance of that? Well, the epigenetic model of reality says the environment signals the gene. Okay. If the end product of an experience in the environment is an emotion, as long as that person is living by the same emotional state, they're signaling the same genes in the same way because the body is believing it's living in the same environment. Genes make proteins. Proteins are responsible for the structure and function of your body. The expression of proteins is the expression of life. Somehow they could actually probably downregulate certain set of gene expressions that cause them to head to a genetic destiny. So the question is, okay, how about that person who hits the rock bottom? And now nothing in their life is making that feeling go away. No drug? No no. No sports car, no vacation, no wardrobe is making that feeling go away. And this is that kind of moment of reckoning where you actually start looking at yourself, that you start observing who you are, right?

[00:13:45.580] - Speaker 1
So. So if that thought and that feeling, that image and that emotion, that stimulus and response is conditioning the mind and body to live in the past, is it possible then, to be defined by a vision of the future and begin to fall in love with that vision of the future to such a degree that your body is so objective that it's believing it's living in that future reality, in the present moment. And could you signal new genes and new ways to change your body in time? Could you stop downregulating certain genes in the body and start upregulating genes into a new body? And our data shows that that's absolutely possible.

[00:14:25.060] - Speaker 2
It's amazing. It's amazing. And even worse than the personal bad event in our society that can trigger us in that way because of because our species has been around for millions of years. We can react to someone insulting us like we're being chased by a lion. You know, it's like the life and death aspect is so. So we have oversize reactions to lesser stimuli in our world.

[00:14:58.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. What was once adaptive? If you were being chased by a T-Rex, that was really adaptive. Yes. Has now become very maladaptive because when you turn on that response and you can't turn it off and living in emergency for that, at that extent of time, no organism can live in emergency. You're tapping all the body's vital resources. Yes. And and so in time, then, um, we keep our bodies knocked out of homeostasis, knocked out of balance. Because that's what stress is. And so the default is always prepare for the worst. Now think about this. If you're preparing for the worst, you're imagining the worst case scenario in your in your mind, and you're actually feeling the angst, the fear, the worry as if it was occurring. And that thought and feeling that stimulus and response is actually conditioning the body to become the mind of anxiety. Keep doing that over time, and you'll program it subconsciously and you'll have a panic attack. Try as you may to control it with your conscious mind.

[00:15:54.860] - Speaker 1
You can't. You programed it subconsciously. So the problem with this is that the arousal of those hormones become very addictive. There's a rush of adrenaline that causes us to go on alert, to get ready to pay attention to, to, to get stimulated in some way. And so then I think people start to look for the problems and conditions in their life, to reaffirm their addiction to that emotion. They need an enemy to feel hatred. They need something in their life to feel judgment. And if their enemy died, well, it's just easy just to find another one because it's really the feeling that's keeping them. So them. So they become and we become, in a sense, addicted to the life we don't even like. And so then, because of the size of the neocortex in the human brain, we can make thought more real than anything else. The frontal lobe does that. So we can turn on that stress response just by thought alone. Now, if those chemicals are addictive and you can turn on that stress response just by thought alone, you could become addicted to your own thoughts.

[00:17:00.840] - Speaker 1
And it's a scientific fact that the long term effects of the hormones of stress downregulate genes and create disease. So that means that our thoughts could literally make us sick. So the fundamental question is if our thoughts could make us sick, is it possible our thoughts could make us well why not?

[00:17:18.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean, they can make us sick. Why not?

[00:17:20.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Of course. And and the belief in that, uh, has to come with information. Yes. And it has to you have to reason with that. You just can't say I'm going to think positively and I hope my disease will go away. This is changing everything. This is changing more than just that. So then say you're not going to complain. Say you're not going to make excuses. Say you're not going to feel sorry for yourself. Say you're not going to judge others. Have that intention. First two hours goes really well, but the body has been conditioned into the familiar past, into the known, and it's the mind and it starts influencing the brain saying, hey, you have the perfect reason to judge this person, or tomorrow's a better day to start or this doesn't feel right. You respond to that thought as if it's the truth. It leads to the same choice, leads to the same behavior, creates the same experience, produces that same familiar emotion. And you say this, this feels right.

[00:18:17.380] - Speaker 2
What's interesting about this is when when I hear you talk about it, it sounds like this is for a small group of people who have terrible problems. But what I'm hearing is this is the is the default position of most people in society. This is how we live. Yeah, you're describing how we live.

[00:18:35.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's 70% of the time we live. So we really have two options then. We could live in survival or we could live in creation. Now, when you're in stress and you're in survival, it's not a time to create. It's not a time to learn. It's not a time to open your heart. It's not a time to be vulnerable. It's not a time to trust.

[00:18:57.160] - Speaker 2
You're protecting.

[00:18:57.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you're in the protective mode. And it's time to run, fight and hide. So the best way to divide people is to keep them in survival and keep them in stress. Because you just don't trust in that state. So then, okay, so what does it take to break an addiction? Addiction is something you think you can't stop or you're doing something and you know it's not good for you and you're doing it anyway, right?

[00:19:18.720] - Speaker 2
Or you might not know you're doing it. And I think in most people's cases, they don't know this is what they're doing.

[00:19:24.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So then, so then now you you decide I'm not going to be this way, but the 95% of who we are by the time we're in the middle of our life is a set of hardwired thoughts and beliefs and perceptions, automatic habits and behaviors, and those emotions that we've become addicted to that keep us in the familiar past. So now you're going to use 5% of your conscious mind to go against 95% of that default. That's automatic because you thought the same way, you made the same choices, you did the same things, you created the same experiences. You lived by the same familiar feelings and emotions every single day. Your life should stay the same because you're staying the same. And nothing changes in our life until we change, right? So. So it just turns out that disentangling from those programs takes an enormous amount of awareness, and it takes an enormous amount of energy. Because just like craving any addiction, you have to be greater than your body. And that's what change means.

[00:20:22.940] - Speaker 1
Yes. To be greater than those familiar emotions that keep us anchored to the past. And by the way, when we feel those emotions, it causes us to remember the past. And the research on brain function and memory says 50% of that narrative, that story you tell isn't even the truth. You're making stuff up and people are reliving a miserable life they never even had. Yes, just to reaffirm the fact that the problem in their life, they had to embellish, to say how difficult it is for them to change. And so it makes sense then that then if a person wakes up and runs through the same routine and I have no problem with routines, I have routines that I love to do that that bring me joy. But if the routine is reaching for your cell phone, first thing you do in the morning, it's 86% of the Western world. And then, you know, going through the same routine behaviors that you always do, and you keep doing that over and over again. A habit is redundant.

[00:21:22.710] - Speaker 1
Set of automatic Unconscious thoughts, behaviors and emotions that's acquired through repetition. You do something long enough. A habit is when your body knows how to do it better than your conscious mind. Now here's the problem. Now you're programed into a predictable future based on what you did in the past and the body on autopilot like that, programed into that future, the body is dragging the mind into that future based on what they have done in the past. And we lose our free will to a set of programs. And so if the familiar past is the known and the predictable future is the known, there's only one place where the unknown exists, and that's the sweet spot of that present moment. And to change, then, is to be greater than the body, as the mind conditioned emotionally into the past and habituated into that future you got to in order to change, you got to get greater than that in order for you to begin to produce some type of change in your biology.

[00:22:17.290] - Speaker 2
So it starts by getting into the present moment, being in the present moment without the baggage of baggage of the past. And then when you're in that state, you can plant a seed for the future that you want to bring forward. Right.

[00:22:29.550] - Speaker 1
Because because otherwise, how could you create something new from the known? Yeah. It just can't exist. So the person sits down to do their inner work. And the moment they close their eyes, they start getting frustrated and they start getting angry, and they start getting impatient and they start self-doubting, and then they listen to the voice, I can't do this because that's that's what the emotion is driving the person. To get back to the known, get back to the familiar, know the safety there, the unknown. You can't predict it, right? So people give up on themselves. And we're actually curious to see what happens when you actually go past that point. When you settle the body back down into the present moment. It's arousal. It's frustration. You tell it, it's no longer the mind, and you take your attention off that person or that problem or that memory or that thought, and you are curious what's beyond that thought? That's the unknown and And the act of doing that over and over again is like training the animal.

[00:23:24.970] - Speaker 1
It's like taming the beast, right? And the person says, they're sitting there and they're working, and all of a sudden they start thinking, oh my God, I got so many emails to do. I got so many places to go. We all know there's so many things to do. And most people get up and say, I'm too busy to do the inner work. Oh, okay. Well, what if you caught yourself and you executed a will that was greater than that program and settled the body back into the present moment and showed it that in the unknown, it's not scary. That not being certain that it's unpredictable, it's actually cool to be there. And you keep working with your body like this, like training an animal every time you do that, that's a victory. Yes. And sooner or later, the body surrenders to a new mind. And when it does, yes, there's an enormous liberation of energy. We go from particle to wave. We go from matter to energy.

[00:24:11.570] - Speaker 1
And literally, we're freeing the body from the chains of the known. And the person then relaxing into the unknown and unknown and realizing nothing scary is going to happen to them.

[00:24:21.950] - Speaker 2
No, it actually feels good.

[00:24:22.990] - Speaker 1
It feels amazing. And that energy moves. We see this on so much of our data. Energy moves right into the heart, and once it makes it to the heart, we know exactly where it's going. It's going right to the brain. And the heart acts as a creative center, and it's informing the brain that it's safe to create again. The brain goes right into these beautiful, coherent alpha brainwave patterns. And the heart is the creative center. And it's saying, think of a new possibility. Become aware or notice something that you're unaware of, and see it as a possibility that you maybe actually want to experience in your future. And if the thought in your mind becomes the experience in that imaginary state, you start to feel the emotion of your future before it happens and you're giving your body a sampling, a taste of the future. Keep doing that every single day. Burying that image in that emotion, that thought in the feeling of feeling of stimulus and response, you could actually condition the body to become the mind of the emotion of the future.

[00:25:21.930] - Speaker 1
Now, you wouldn't be waiting for your healing to feel grateful. You wouldn't be waiting for your new relationship to feel love. You wouldn't be waiting for your success to feel empowered, or your wealth to feel abundant or mystical moment to feel. Or that would be, you know, living by cause and effect. This is really you causing an effect. This is the moment you start feeling grateful. Your healing begins right the moment we start feeling abundant, we're generating wealth. The moment we feel empowered, we're connecting to a future. The moment we're in love with life, we're in love with ourselves. We create people in our lives. That way, the moment we're in awe of life, we're going to have a mystical moment, you know? And that's causing an effect. So then you get up from doing that. Then the creator of your life should see evidence in those synchronicities. Yes. And those serendipities and those coincidences and those opportunities. So you nod your head in and something innate in you awakens and says, I actually am a creator of my life.

[00:26:20.790] - Speaker 1
I forgot I'm too busy believing that I'm the victim of my life now. I actually, oh my God, I'm actually believing that I created some of this. Wow. Now it's no longer work. Now it's fun. Now you do it because you want to measure the effects of you it cause. And how long can we maintain this state of being our entire day, independent of the conditions going on in our life, independent of the needs and the emotional addictions and habits of the body, independent of time. Practice that as an experiment and you should see things coming to you in your life in unknown ways. And that's the mystery, right? That's where it gets fun.

I could imagine someone hearing this and thinking this is a form of brainwashing. And brainwashing is scary. But if you start with the idea that we're already brainwashed, you know we're already brainwashed in a negative way. What's what's pulling us down now is a brainwash that we did not sign up for. Right, right. And we're already there. So our goal is to reprogram ourselves to get past the old programing that that we didn't sign up for. We didn't we didn't program ourselves intentionally before we made up stories based on I feel bad. So it must be because of this. We make up a story to explain it, and then we live with this false belief that this is what's causing our pain. When we can really think our way out of it.

[00:30:39.460] - Speaker 1
Sure. Well, um. Two things. First of all, I think that's a that's a default. I think that's built in. I think we're programed to be victims in our life. If you say to someone, why are you feeling this way? Why are you acting this way? They'll say, I am this way because of that person, that circumstance, that condition in my life. What they're really saying is that circumstance, that condition, that person is actually controlling their feelings and thoughts and anything that controls our feelings or thoughts or anything that controls us, we are victim to. So when things are good, we feel good. And when things are bad, you feel bad. And and so it just there's a lot of agreement in the program of being a victim. Is that something or someone is doing it to us. Right. And so you can make an excuse, you can blame, you can complain. It all makes sense for people who are living by that same energy, that same emotional state.

[00:31:32.960] - Speaker 1
They'll share the same information, exchange the same information because they're feeling the same emotions and energy. So so that's normal in our life. But it makes sense though, then if you actually are to experiment with your life, if, if I change, is it possible that my life changes? Okay, so let's demystify it and make it really simple. Your personality creates your personal reality. That's it. Your personality is made up of how you think, how you act, and how you feel. So the present personality who's listening to this podcast has created the present personal reality called There Life There. The creator of it. Not their boss, not their ex. They're creating their life. Okay. So if we agree with that, then in order for you to create a new personal reality, then you would have to change your personality in order for you to change your life. You would have to change. Okay, so then how do you change? Does a really good question. Okay, you better start thinking about what you've been thinking about and decide if you're going to accept, believe and surrender to that thought or not.

[00:32:35.740] - Speaker 1
Right? So if you've been thinking that way the majority of your life, then it's a hard wired circuit firing wiring over and over again. It becomes more automatic and you never know that voice is there until you step out of the known and you decide you want to change. Then I can all of a sudden becomes a very loud voice in your head. Or I'll start tomorrow, whatever that is. Okay, so then it makes sense then, that you would have to become so conscious of that unconscious thought that you would not go unconscious to it in your waking, that you would never let it slip by your awareness, unchecked or unnoticed. Okay, now that takes energy and awareness. Okay, but if I've been behaving in the same exact way and it's become a habit, and a habit is when you go unconscious, then you would have to catch yourself every time you started to speak in a limited way. Every time you started acting a certain way, you'd have to become so conscious of those behaviors that you wouldn't go back into the habit and go unconscious.

[00:33:29.000] - Speaker 1
And so the question is, how many times do we have to forget until we stop forgetting and start remembering? That's the moment of change, right? Okay. So then people feel the same emotions every single day. It just feels like who they are, but they never really are aware that they're just feeling guilty or unworthy or sad or whatever. It's just the way they feel. Okay, so now you want a new life. You can't take those feelings with you. If you want to be happy, it makes sense. You're going to have to leave those feelings behind and literally stop feeling that way and start feeling another way. And if you react to the same people and the same problems in your life, you're going to feel the same way. You're the same personality, because those emotions are going to drive the same behaviors and the same thoughts, and your personality is going to stay, and you'll stay the same, and your personal reality is going to stay the same. Okay. So then the word meditation, I looked it up.

[00:34:18.220] - Speaker 1
It means to become familiar with, to become so conscious of those states of mind and body that you actually don't have to go unconscious and and you can change. Right? And that's because of the size of the neocortex and the frontal lobe. We can we could actually have this idea of metacognition. We can separate ourselves from the program. And that consciousness is us not being unconscious. And it takes consciousness. It takes awareness. It takes energy to do that. Okay. So still, if you still don't believe this though, but could you then learn a way to think differently and fire and wire new thoughts in your brain? Install hardware and with intention and with attention. Start deciding what you do want to believe and a belief is belief is just a thought. You keep thinking over and over again until you hard wired in your brain. Could I have the intention of installing a new belief? Could that be the new voice in my head? How would greatness think today? How would an unlimited mind act today?

[00:35:15.040] - Speaker 1
So then, if you said, how am I going to act in my zoom calls with my kids, with my ex, with my coworkers, with my wife, is there a greater way that I could behave in this day? What is the what does greatness look like? What would love do? And you actually close your eyes and rehearse the action. There's so much compelling data to show that the act of mental rehearsal changes your brain to look like you already did it. Wow. To look like the experience has already happened. Now the brain is no longer a record of the past. You are priming the brain for a future behavior. Keep firing and wiring installing that hardware. It becomes a software program and you start to behave as that person, no different than the person who's playing an instrument, or rehearsing a dance, or reviewing their lines as an actor or an actress or a sports figure rehearsing their moves. The brain actually changes so that it looks like the event has already occurred. Now you have circuits in place to use.

[00:36:23.690] - Speaker 1
Okay, now here's the hard part. Okay, so I want to be happy in my life. I want to be grateful in my life. I want to I want to feel more creativity. I want to feel more more love. Okay. Am I going to wait for something out there to change, to take away this lack or emptiness? Or can I actually generate this feeling on my own? If I stop practicing feeling anxiety and frustration, I stop feeling sad. Now, this isn't positive thinking. This is actually deciding what you want to teach your body emotionally, to feel every day programing yourself. Conditioning and programing. And if you said I'm not getting up until I'm in love with life. Oh, the game is on right now. You got to really open that heart of yours.

[00:37:08.270] - Speaker 2
You're making a commitment.

[00:37:09.470] - Speaker 1
Commitment with intention. And. And when you assign meaning behind any act, you get a greater outcome. And to me, the creative process is getting lost in the act until it creates the experience right in that moment. Right. So the person who's practicing feeling gratitude, who's practicing feeling love for no reason at all. Yes. And they can become so familiar with the old self that they can become so familiar with the new self they become familiar with, and teach your body to feel that way, and actually give them the tools to check the feedback. If they're actually in that state where their heart is in balance, in order to give them the feedback, to let them know the brain is, in more order, more coherence. If you kept thinking that way. If you kept acting that way, you kept feeling that way. I would guarantee you your life would have to change in some way. And what we discovered in our research is that so many chronic health conditions go away, like stage four cancers, like blindness, like deafness, like lupus, like multiple sclerosis, like muscular dystrophy, like spinal cord injuries, strokes, rare genetic disorders.

[00:38:24.330] - Speaker 1
The person and I know that's hard for a lot of people to accept, but we have the data to show this, that the person's a different person. The disease existed.

[00:38:34.330] - Speaker 2
In old person, had that disease, and now they're reborn as a new person. And the new person doesn't have that disease.

[00:38:41.450] - Speaker 1
They'll tell you that I'm not that person any longer. I'm somebody else. And their biology, in a.

[00:38:47.490] - Speaker 2
Way, the disease was a program as well.

[00:38:50.970] - Speaker 1
It was the the disease was programed. I see. Yeah. And so now they're, they're actually when they're feeling that elevated emotion, something really profound happens. You don't feel separate from your dreams. Yes. I mean, how could you feel separate from your future if you feel like it's already happened? That's when you stop looking for it and and get ready because the experiment gets really interesting. That's when that's when you start seeing these unknown events or downloads or whatever you want to call it start. You start to see so many more things you are unaware of. So to answer that question for me personally, if you asked me two years ago if I thought that I would be seeing the type of changes in people's health or changes in their life like I'm seeing right now, I'd say maybe once or twice. But now my belief in what's possible has changed so dramatically, so dramatically in witnessing common people like you and I doing the uncommon. They're not monks, they're not academics. They don't have 40 years of devotion.

[00:39:59.650] - Speaker 1
They're just people that are pragmatists saying, how do I do this? And I think science is the language to demystify that process. So combine a little quantum physics with a little neuroscience, a little neuroendocrinology, a little psychoneuroimmunology, mind body connection, epigenetics, electromagnetism, build a model. This is what we this is what we're interested in. Build that model of understanding. And that information causes people to become aware of possibilities that they are unaware of. If they didn't have that information so so information, the right information, if they learn that information and they understand that learning is making new connections in your brain. Okay, I understand that. So I'm going to learn this stuff. If remembering is maintaining and sustaining it then let's do this. Let's build a model of understanding. You retreat from your life. I retreat from my life. We'll build a model of understanding, of new possibility with new information. Okay, now, now that I've learned this information, I got to remember it. So let's teach it back to each other.

[00:40:55.350] - Speaker 1
Let's let's build a model and let's make sure there's nothing left to conjecture, to superstition, to dogma. Let's let's understand exactly what we're doing and why. So then as you exchange that information and remind yourself of what you've learned, you're reproducing the same level of mind and mind is the brain in action. So now you're installing neurological hardware in preparation for the experience. The more you understand what you're doing, the more you understand why you're doing it. The how gets easier. Okay, so now give people numerous opportunities to overcome themselves, numerous opportunities to connect, give the information away, then give them the instruction on how to if they get their behaviors to match their intentions, they get their actions equal to their thoughts. They kind of get it worked out and they get their mind and body working together. They're going to have a new experience now. Experience enriches circuitry in the brain now. It's not philosophical any longer. It's not theoretical. It's not Actual now. Now the experience is actually reinforcing the philosophy.

[00:41:54.090] - Speaker 1
The moment those networks of neurons string into place, the brain makes a chemical, and that chemical is called a feeling or an emotion. And now the moment you feel elevated, the moment you feel unlimited, the moment you feel grateful, the moment you feel free, you are teaching your body chemically to understand what your mind is intellectually understood. So now the information is not just in the mind, now the information is in the body, and you're embodying the truth of that information and you are literally changing your biology, okay? If you've done it once, you've got to be able to do it again. So if you can reproduce an experience over and over again, sooner or later, you're neurologically and chemically neurochemically going to condition your mind and body to begin to work as one in unison. And now you are literally becoming more Nate. It's becoming more automatic. It's becoming more second nature. You're mastering that knowledge now. It's you're moving into a state of state of being. You're becoming that knowledge.

[00:42:50.510] - Speaker 1
And so when a person actually reaches that point, there's a dramatic change in their physiology and their biology. It makes sense then that there's less there's there's less of the past left in their body. So I think it is going from philosopher to initiate to master, from knowledge to experience to wisdom, from mind, body to soul, from thinking to doing to being to learning with your head, applying with your hands, knowing it by heart to to believe, to behave, to become. And I think that journey people make that and they and they can stand in front of an audience of 2000 people and they're the example of truth there on the stage saying, I had stage four cancer. It was in my bones. It was in my liver, it was in my lungs. And and I'm as surprised as everybody. I'm looking at this person. They don't look vegan, they don't look buffed, they don't look young. They just look like a normal person. Yes. I mean, they're telling their story, and you're looking at them and they're the example of truth.

[00:43:51.560] - Speaker 1
They are the four minute mile and the collective. Amazing. Yeah. The collective becomes aware.

[00:43:57.720] - Speaker 2
Of everything is impossible until someone does it. Exactly. And then when you start seeing several people do it, we don't even think it's impossible anymore. Yeah. And it's so beautiful that you're demonstrating that you're collecting a group of people who have these experiences so that we can all see them and understand what's possible.

[00:44:17.120] - Speaker 1
It's unbelievable to me. Yes, it's I have to I'm literally changing my belief in that moment. And this person, sometimes their diagnosis, their condition got worse. Yes. They lost everything. They had a lot of doubt. They had a lot of fear. They had a lot of pain and they could have just stopped doing the work. But if they did, then they wouldn't believe it was possible. And they showed up. And I said to them, why sometimes did you do the do the work three times in one day? No, they were not doing their meditations to heal. They were doing their meditations to change. And when they defaulted back to that disbelief that they couldn't heal, that's when they instead of staying there, they said, I got to change my belief. And they wouldn't get up until they were in a different state of being. And it was the overcoming process that was the becoming process. They became somebody else there. Their health condition was their teacher. They would have never become that person.

[00:45:17.620] - Speaker 1
Right. So they stand in front of an audience, and I'm looking out at the collective and everybody's leaning in and they're there. They're listening to truth. And, and and when you see the Pet scans and there's there's no metastatic cancer in the bone. I mean, I'm scratching my head, I am I am so different because of these people. We had a guy with muscular dystrophy like I've never seen that condition ever change. He walked into a week long event and he came in in a wheelchair and walked out. He walked out. I could not believe my eyes. So just like a infection could spread amongst the community and create disease. I think health and wellness can be as infectious as disease. And so you get a group of people and you start seeing people break through a certain level of consciousness or unconsciousness, and they're telling their story to 2000 people. Now everybody in the audience is looking at thinking, if that person can do it, I can do it. So not only is there a footprint in the quantum field of new possibility that exists, but now there's evidence in in three dimensional reality, and now sooner or later, someone in the audience is going to relate with that person and you're going to start seeing more and more of that realized.

[00:47:56.280] - Speaker 2
Is there a typical time frame it takes to reprogram the brain?

[00:48:02.080] - Speaker 1
I have, I have seen it happen in one instant. Really? Yeah. And I've seen it take for for some people seven years, some people 12 years. And it's really, it's really interesting because many people say, God, this this sounds so right. You know, I believe in this information. I saw the testimonials. I saw your science, scientific data. I believed it was possible. I just never thought it was. I never believed it was possible for me. Oh, that's just a really defining moment. Because if you literally really take that on, that means you got to show up for up for yourself. Yes. You got to get out of the bleachers. You got on the playing field. And the beauty behind that is that means if you're showing up for yourself and you're believing in possibility, then you got to believe in yourself. And if you believe in yourself, you better be believing in possibility. And so it was the constant choice to show up for themselves and believe in that future, over time, that they actually became that belief.

[00:49:04.420] - Speaker 1
Right. And so, I mean, I think there's that that gives people permission then to try it out for themselves.

[00:49:13.700] - Speaker 2
Um, are there any other mystical experiences from childhood you can share? Just fun to talk about.

[00:49:19.820] - Speaker 1
Um, well, let's talk about them a little bit about the mechanics of it, because I think it's kind of interesting. And we can lead to some of those fun things. Great. Um, so one of the things that I was interested in and still am very interested in is really understanding the mystical, and the mystical just means unknown, right? Something that's outside of the known. Right. And that's usually, you know, any unconventional like that is you step out of convention, you're always considered a little bit of a heretic or a little bit crazy. Um, but when I had those mystical experiences, um, and then as I got older and I had him in college at certain moments, especially if I studied really hard and pushed myself past the point where I really wanted to stop. But I just went a little further and I'd fall asleep and I would I would have a very mystical moment. Uh, when I started really saying, okay, if I have those have had those experiences and I've known enough people who have, what is it in the brain that's actually doing this?

[00:50:18.160] - Speaker 1
Right. So, um, when we started looking at the brain scans and we started seeing those areas in gamma right around the autonomic nervous system, super hot, really hot. And the lights were out and the, the mechanism, the neocortex, you know that what plugs us into three dimensional reality? The autobiographical Self Gone wow, just shut out and something was happening that was in an altered state, right? So the area that we started seeing really hot in the limbic brain was the pineal gland and that tiny little. Pine cone shaped gland that's like about the size of a pine nut that sits right in the corner of the third ventricle, somehow is always in that area. It was always very active. And so I started doing the research to look to see what is it about this little mystical center. And I didn't want to just study people that study DMT or, or I didn't want it to be too spiritual or too, for lack of a better word, 60s or hippie. I wanted it to be like I wanted to study the scientists that were like, spent their whole life looking at this thing.

[00:51:26.860] - Speaker 1
They have no idea about any of that stuff. And what did you what would you you know, what did you discover? And so It turns out that inside the pineal gland, there's these tiny little crystals, and they're rhombohedron in shape. You know, they're six sided, very geometrical. And the articles that I started reading and discovering said the the pineal gland was a neuroendocrine transducer with piezoelectric properties. Now, I know that's a lot of big words. Instead of just shelving it, I looked up the word piezoelectric. I learned it in college physics, I just forgot. And it really is, is that when you apply a mechanical stress to a material, the mechanical stress changes into an electrical charge. It becomes electrically activated. So these tiny little crystals that are sitting in the pineal gland that are stacked up on top of each other, they're very geometric and they have piezoelectric properties. If you compress those crystals, the compression of those crystals creates a polar charge on each end of the crystal, a positive or negative charge.

[00:52:28.910] - Speaker 1
And when you have a positive, a negative charge, you have a have a magnet, and a magnet has an invisible electromagnetic field. You can't see it, but it exists. Okay, so now there's a principle in biology that says endowment. You don't use it, you lose it. Crystals are there. And why haven't they gone away? They're in most vertebrates. Homing pigeons have them so they can navigate. True. North chameleons have them to pick up infrared frequency to change their color by releasing melanin in the pineal gland. So we have them to like. So why do we have them? And they haven't gone away. So if you compress those crystals, the application of that force creating that electromagnetic field causes that field to actually expand as the crystal expands and then as the crystal can expand any longer, the field reverses and it exerts another field against those crystals and it compresses the crystals again. And all of a sudden you have this little radio receiver that's that's sending out signals of frequency. Okay.

[00:53:32.550] - Speaker 1
So is it possible, then, that that's the brain's radio receiver that could actually pick up frequency and transduce. And the word transducer was in the article. Transducer is a is a TV antenna that's going to take the information on that wavelength of that frequency. And the information in the encoder descramble it into imagery and a profound experience. So then I started looking for are there chemicals that are derivatives that could be released that alter brain function? Okay. So I had to go through a bunch of articles and well, you know, serotonin and melatonin are the common pineal neurotransmitters. And serotonin is what gives us our experience of daylight and waking wakefulness and consciousness. And melatonin is the kind of the nighttime neurotransmitter. And that's that that's that kind of dreaming chemical. So is it possible, then, if the pineal gland actually could connect to energy and frequency like a radio receiver and pick up frequencies that are beyond our senses, beyond visible light, our experience of the spectrum of light. Would melatonin still be melatonin, or could it be an upgraded version of melatonin that fits into the same receptor sites as serotonin?

[00:54:57.170] - Speaker 1
Melatonin carry a completely different message. In other words, is it possible that the physics of the field connects to the biology of the brain and body through this little radio receiver? So we started seeing this area as getting super hot, the pineal gland getting really hot. And we were thinking, this is where this is where the tuning fork is picking up the signal. So then how are you measuring this. We're looking at we're looking at a real time quantitative EEGs. We're looking at 38 compartments of the brain. Right. So we actually are getting really good at being able to predict when a person's going to actually go into the state they move way outside of normal and theta, so that we know they're open to information. So. There are metabolites of melatonin that melatonin is already an antioxidant. But now it produces two very powerful antioxidants, very very powerful antioxidants anticancer anti-aging and heart disease and stroke. Anti neurodegenerative anti-inflammatory antimicrobial. Take it tweak it again. Melatonin already causes you to relax. But now you're going to really chillax.

[00:56:04.790] - Speaker 1
Your brain will make a benzodiazepine. That's Valium right? Shut off the survival centers in the brain. Same chemical found in hibernating animals now. Melatonin already causes you to go into sleep, but now you're going to go into a very, very deep sleep. And hibernation is no sex drive, no appetite, no preoccupation with the with the environment. Kind of the lower energy hormonal centers in our body kind of just go into stasis. They just kind of shut off. Same chemical found in electric eels. Okay. That's a that's a high amplitudes of energy in the nervous system. And we're seeing these high amplitudes of energy in the nervous system. And then the most powerful hallucinogenic known to man. So that tri trimethyl tryptamine that DMT, right. That very powerful chemical.

[00:56:49.090] - Speaker 2
This is and this is happening by the radio frequency is changing the melatonin.

[00:56:54.730] - Speaker 1
My hypothesis is that when the frequency that is actually connecting to the brain. Now how do you do that. The brain's got to be coherent. The whole entire brain has to be synchronized. It's got to be what syncs in the brain links in the brain. Stress causes a disintegration of those networks, right? This is when this the whole entire brain, the whole brain is dancing to the same music. It's the same symphonies playing in the brain. Now, when the brain is that coherent, it can read. It can read a signal, right? The more coherent the brain is, the more it could entrain to frequency. So when we see these profound changes take place in the person's brain in that state, and we see these areas amplified, they're having a very full on sensory experience. As I said, without their senses, they're having a vision, a transcendental experience that seems to be more real than than the very world you believe is real. And in that inward event somehow can change the biology of the body in a matter of seconds.

[00:57:54.550] - Speaker 1
So if we take the blood, the plasma of those people who have that interaction with energy and frequency and that aroused state, we take that plasma and we put it in the presence of a cancer cell, a uterine cancer cell, a breast cancer cell, a pancreatic cancer cell. It'll take 70% of the mitochondrial function right out of the cancer cell. In other words, cancer cells need to multiply and move, right? So the mitochondria are the energy centers of the cells. You're taking 70% of the energy out of the cell. You see this dramatic change in cellular biology. Um, and so the information somehow that that is in the blood that wasn't there before. Yes, that is now. There is not coming from any exogenous substance. The person is not ingesting anything. And we're finding this robust pharmacy of chemicals in the body's nervous system that that actually work better than drugs. They they work better than any pharmaceutical. And I keep asking the scientists, where is this information coming from? It's coming from within us.

[00:59:13.130] - Speaker 1
And in seven days, people who moved through a process of true change and transformation, they engage fully. They immerse themselves in the process. At the end of seven days, their blood and their genes will look like they're literally living in a whole new life, in a whole new reality. And the amazing part is the seven days that we show our our data to scientists. And they cannot believe that those changes are happening in seven days. So for me, the mystical moment can be anything that causes me to have a change in my perception of reality. After I wrote an article for a scientific magazine. To get back to your question. I was a young guy and I had just gotten the article accepted, and I was just looking at all these derivatives of melatonin. I was asking, why are they there, and could it be related to that transcendental moment? So here's here's the story. So I had just put my kids to bed, and I had just cleaned everything up. And I sat down and down.

[01:00:18.080] - Speaker 1
There was a fire in my living room, and I hear the kids kind of in the other room. And I was saying, hey, come on, I'm going to come in there, you know? And they kind of they kind of settled down and, um, I sat on the couch and I just started looking into the fire. And I think one of the cool things about gazing into fire is that there's there's no predictability. There's a kind of a kind of a way that it's just kind of causes you to be present. So I kind of was looking at the fire. I thought about all the things I would do the next day, and I said, I don't want to think about any of that. I want to think about what I want to think about. And so I was gazing into the fire, and I was kind of half awake and half asleep, and I kind of closed my eyes and I started thinking about this article I had written, and I thought, well, I was talking to the pineal gland.

[01:01:01.680] - Speaker 1
I said, where are you anyway? And I kind of fished around in my brain just with my awareness. And I said, oh, and the moment I locked into it, it was like a screen opened up and I saw this Beautiful, beautiful image of this gland with its mouth open and this white, milky substance flowing out of it. And I just thought, whoa, that could be my pineal gland. And then the scene changes and I see this amazing, beautiful timepiece with a crystal glass surface. And I'm just. This is I'm lucid now. I could see the I could see the very details of the glass and the and the colors and the shine. And there's Roman numerals on this timepiece, and all of a sudden I see the hands of time. The two arms of the the clock start rolling backwards in time as it's rolling backwards in time really fast. I'm thinking to myself, oh, the pineal gland is like a biological timepiece that we can move forwards and backwards in time.

[01:02:04.780] - Speaker 1
And then there I am. I'm standing above myself and I'm a nine year old kid, and I'm laying in bed. And now, while I'm having this experience, I'm the nine year old kid again. I forgot that I had this moment. Now I'm reliving the moment. I had the covers right up to my nose. And at the same time, I'm standing next to the bed, looking at myself as my present self, and I'm viewing some aspect of my past self. So I traveled through time and I saw a dimension, a space. And my mother had just left the room and she said to my father, he's burning up. And I thought when she left the room, I thought, yes. And I had the aspirin in my flannel pocket of my pants there, and I had my hand over it, and I thought, everybody's finally gone. Here we go. And I close my eyes. And now I'm watching myself. And I'm living the experience at the same time. I'm outside of time, right?

[01:03:03.000] - Speaker 1
Linear space time. And I'm watching this kid and he's trying to figure out time. I'm watching this nine year old kid. Look at time like cubes on a three dimensional checkerboard. And I'm trying to figure out how when you change, how everything changes. I'm in this very deep contemplation in this mystical place as a nine year old kid, and I'm watching myself as my present self, and I look at this kid and I fall in love with him, and I think I'm still doing that. That's of course, that's me. And I knew in that moment I fell in love with that kid that he was going to become me or I was. I became some aspect of him, an evolved version of him. And the moment I fell in love with him, I knew that I was connected to him and somehow he would find me. I don't know how else to describe that. That my love was going to draw him to me, who I was in that present moment, outside of time.

[01:04:04.500] - Speaker 1
And I just I just had this incredible understanding and compassion for who I was all of a sudden, here comes the timepiece again. And I look at it and it's it is just luminous. And all of a sudden I see the. Hands of time move forward and I start moving forward in time. I'm traveling through time. Like in three dimensional, three dimensional reality. We travel through space. We travel through space, and we experience time. Right. And the quantum you. There's nowhere to go. There's no space. So you don't go anywhere. You travel through time and you experience dimensions or spaces. So I start seeing the hands move forward in time. And next thing you know, I'm I'm on my ranch in the northwest and it's a beautiful autumn evening and it is freezing cold and the moon is out and I'm wearing this very long cape and I'm barefoot, and there is a prism of frozen grass in front of me, and the light is coming off the prisms of the grass, and the whole thing is magical.

[01:05:08.040] - Speaker 1
And I am like an upgraded version of myself. Like I'm the exalted version of me, and I'm walking through the pastures, walking towards the stallions. And I feel incredibly noble. I feel really amazing, and my feet on the ground somehow was wasn't painful. It was pleasure. I was part of the whole I was I was wholeness in parts, and I was connected to everything and the cold was just. I loved it, I wanted more of it. The night was rich, and I was walking across my yard into this area where I had these big basalt stones, and I walked on those stones. And when I moment I touched the stones, I knew they knew me and I knew I knew them. And there was this kind of exchange. And I moved over to this fountain that I had built with my brother. And I looked at the fountain, I laughed, and I thought of when we had built this thing together and how much fun we had. And all of a sudden I see this radiant woman.

[01:06:06.940] - Speaker 1
That's It's maybe ten inches in height and she's glowing in light. And now remember, I was feeling pretty good at that point. And she looked me right in the eye. And she sent me this thought. And I felt this level of love that I had never felt before in my life. And on that, that energy was there's always more love. And I thought, oh my God, like, here I am thinking I was doing pretty good. That was nothing compared to what I just felt there. And she looked at me and I turned around and then I what am I doing here? And I saw my present self moments before washing the dishes in the kitchen, and I was standing outside of my house as my future version of myself. And I was looking at this guy washing dishes, and I'm watching him doing the same thing. He's trying to dovetail concepts and ideas, and he's trying to figure things out, and he's sincere and he's I fall in love with him. I see his your strengths, I see his limitations.

[01:07:08.170] - Speaker 1
I see everything about him. And I fall in love with him. And. And while I'm washing the dishes, I forgot. But I had this really weird feeling like someone was watching me. So I set everything down and I tried to look out the window, but I thought I got ten dogs on the property here. Someone would be going off if there was somebody out there, you know? So I went back to wash the dishes and I had that chilling moment. But I think the interesting thing about the whole thing was that the feeling that I felt from that interaction with that being lasted for two weeks, like the feeling in my heart, that heat, that fullness, the experience that somewhat seemed outside of this dimension of space and time. I still had the feeling of that feeling. I started questioning what is real. Yes, what is real is that maybe we're not linear beings living a linear life. Maybe we're dimensional beings living a dimensional life. And I I think when the doors of dimension opened to us and we get a glimpse that there's an infinite number of units that are existing simultaneously, I think the game changes, I really do.

[01:08:14.630] - Speaker 1
So the mystical moment for me is something that I've been working really diligently and demystifying. So those derivatives that are from melatonin, I speculate, are the very derivatives that fit into the same receptor sites as serotonin and melatonin. But melatonin can't be melatonin because that's the function of the wavelength of visible light. This person's now have their eyes closed and they're interacting with a frequency that is not visible light. Melatonin can't be melatonin. Now it's got to be an upgraded version. So. And then when the brain brain cranks on like that and it opens up the effect of their interaction, how energy is informing matter is actually causing the body to be lifted by a greater frequency. And so we've seen blind people see in that moment, we've seen deaf people hear, I know this sounds crazy. We've seen in a matter of moments someone in a with a.l.s. in a wheelchair just step out of that wheelchair. A spinal cord injury. Someone's back on their feet again. Somehow their interaction with energy and frequency is giving the body an upgrade.

[01:09:17.010] - Speaker 1
And you can't get the upgrade from inside the virtual reality experience. You have to get the upgrade from outside of it, you know? And so the physical is something that we work really diligently on experiencing because that is the unknown.

[01:09:30.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it's only mystical because we don't understand it. That's all it is. Yeah, exactly. Do you think that these, um, the things you're talking about are very revolutionary in, in our current time? Is it possible that some of these things are are lost information? That's ancient.

[01:09:51.690] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So, um, I here's I think that it is. And I don't want to at all sound egocentric in that because I, keep saying to the scientists, I can't believe this is the truth. Like, I can't believe this is the truth. Like, I've been so hypnotized and conditioned that I thought it was outside of me. And here we are. We're taking people. They they haven't even meditated before. In fact, you're going to do really well because you're going to tell. You're going to do exactly what we asked you to do, and it's going to evolve, right? So in seven days, novice meditators, there are so many upregulation of so many metabolites. There's so many epigenetic changes, so many lipids and amines changing in their body in seven days. These are these are novice meditators. At the end of seven days, their blood looks like an advanced meditator in seven days. So it's to me it's mind blowing. So so you do it. You do a study, a drug study.

[01:10:57.310] - Speaker 1
A drug study is about, at its.

[01:10:59.290] - Speaker 6
Best.

[01:11:00.050] - Speaker 1
25%. Cause and effect 25% of the people get affected in a really good way. Our data, when we look at the effects, is between 75 and 85% causality. It works three times better than any drug. And again, the person's not taking a drug. So for me, like I cannot go back to business as usual.

[01:11:23.370] - Speaker 2
I cannot say no downside and no side effects. And no.

[01:11:27.290] - Speaker 1
There's no, there's there's nothing except the person changing, right? And somehow their interaction with frequency and energy. I mean, think about it. Come on. We're perceiving less than 1% of reality. And at best, when we're conscious, we can appreciate the sunset. But what about that other 99.999% of the atom? That's information. That's energy. That's nothing. We're unaware of it. There are dimensions that we're not aware of. Right? So. So when people start interacting with energy in frequency, frequency carries information. The more coherent that autonomic nervous system is and you can get it get it by your heart or get it by your brain. We've kind of isolated both ways. When people start getting entrained to energy and frequency, crazy things happen. I mean, crazy stuff. So we have again, this is important to know because this is if we don't know it, we we're unaware of it. And if we're unaware of it, it doesn't exist for us. And we make the same choice, right?

[01:12:19.230] - Speaker 2
So we can't we can't engage in it if we don't, if we don't see it.

[01:12:22.710] - Speaker 1
Exactly. So so we took so we took these people that actually can demonstrate brain and heart coherence. And we discovered that the more relaxed you can get in your heart, the more you'll get awake in your brain, the more gamma you'll have in your brain. Relaxed in the heart and awake in the brain is speaking from my present state of ignorance, the extent of our research that that's when you're not your animal human self, that's living in stress and survival. That's in a program and unconscious. So you get people to get relaxed in their heart, in awake, in their brain, and you get them collectively to come together. And resonance is when. Things appear to be resonating out of order and separate all of a sudden start. To entrain and resonate in order. And human beings do that same thing. So you get. 1800 people together. And now it's not about you any longer. It's about healing somebody else. And if it's true, that does not matter that it's emitting a field.

[01:13:18.130] - Speaker 1
It's the field that's actually informing matter, changing information in the field. Could you change matter? So we do that and we put these random event generators through the entire room, all around the room. And a random event generator is like a sophisticated coin toss. So the more you toss a coin, the more you're going to get a 5,050% heads and tails. So these are machines that are programed randomly to go heads, heads heads tails tails heads tails tails tails tails heads heads like that. But it's 50% of the time, right. And it's programed that way. It's a machine. Right. Okay. And it's sensitive to Sensitive to electromagnetism. So set them up around the room. And now get a group of people come together and get a collective network of observers to have a very specific intent. They're no longer about you. Yes. It's no longer about me. It's that someone's mother there. That's someone's brother. That's someone's kid. That's someone's best friend. And could we actually stretch the model and see if we change the field?

[01:14:18.030] - Speaker 1
We could change matter, right? And we have data to show that that's possible. When we look at the random event generators, during that time when everybody gets intentional, random events become less random and more intentional.

[01:14:31.750] - Speaker 2
Unbelievable.

[01:14:32.710] - Speaker 1
Almost 100% of the time, the machine behaves abnormally right during that window where everybody's coming together, right? And so then it is collective networks of observers that determine reality. And it's not the number of people. It's not the amount of energy. It's the most coherent signal, right? So brain and heart coherence is your Wi-Fi signal. And when you're in your heart and you're out of survival and you're present in that moment, how much further can you extend the model so the person heals themselves of cancer? The next question is can we heal another person? Now we're we do these coherence healings and we have people stepping out of wheelchairs, uh, people having dramatic changes in their vision, their eyesight, and they look like you and me and the people that are doing it are opening their hearts, and they're getting beyond their identity. That's the only way I can describe it. And that's my definition of creation. When I forget about me, I'm in a good state, right? So get everybody doing that.

[01:15:36.320] - Speaker 1
At the same time. You see these machines that are programed. It's amazing to behave abnormally every single time. So incredible. So you we need to know that in some way. I said the scientists from Harvard the other day Tell me. Tell me how that's possible. Tell me how these non-local changes are happening. Take twins. Identical twins. We set them in separate rooms. One's having a transcendental experience and meditation. The other one's watching a boring documentary on laying cable in the Atlantic Ocean. And the one who's watching the boring documentary. Their heart, their heart and brain are behaving like the person who's who's having the transcendental moment. How do you explain that? You cannot explain that without understanding. On some level, we are all connected, right? And that's that's a good model for us to believe in.

[01:16:28.140] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. It's beautiful. Let's talk about, um, the difference between meditation while you're measuring versus not okay. Measurement. Yeah. Benefits. Positives and negatives.

[01:16:42.540] - Speaker 1
Okay. Um, so, um, we when we use the model of meditation, I. My interest is to make it practical, to demystify the process. We were talking earlier about that process of unlearning and relearning, of breaking the habit of the old self and reinventing a new self, pruning synaptic connections, sprouting new connections and wiring and wiring, rewiring and rewiring, deprogramming and reprograming. Losing your mind and creating a new one. Memorizing emotions that have been stored in the body, then reconditioning the body to a new mind and to a new emotion. And meditation is that inward process where we have to disconnect and dissociate from everything outside of us, where there's nothing but you. That's really when there is nothing but you, when you are aware of nothing but you. That is a very delicate moment of a critical moment between order and chaos in the brain. So to become familiar with an old self and become familiar with a new self. Okay, let's admit it. The hardest part about change is not making the same choices you did the day before.

[01:17:48.660] - Speaker 1
The moment you decide to make a different choice, whatever it is, it's going to feel uncomfortable. You're stepping out of the known into the unknown. It's unpredictable. It's uncertain. It's unfamiliar. Right? It's it's that place where possibility exists. And most people in the unknown is a very scary place. Stress is created from. You can't predict something. You lose control of something. You have the perception that something's going to get worse. That's the unknown. You run, right? So for the most part, then the unknown is a scary place. That present moment tends to be the unknown, and if people can relax into it, their veneer begins to broaden and they can now be present. And they're not preoccupied with trying to anticipate the next moment based on the past moment. That's the default, right? So so we use meditation really to remind ourselves of who we want to become, really. And the imagination and the process and giving people the science and the information to be able to do that and practice it is really the then taking, then rehearsing your lines, inwardly, rehearsing your moves and your behaviors and get out now and you can't be in that state.

[01:18:51.560] - Speaker 1
And then five minutes later, default and go back to the old personality. Your life will stay the same because you're the same personality. You got to be able to maintain that modified state of mind and body really well. You got to get so good at doing it with your eyes closed. You got to be able to do it with your eyes open. And that's the game, right? That's the game. So we use meditation in that way as the first model okay. So we know to change is to be greater than your environment, to be greater than your body and to be greater than time to be in the present moment. Okay. So what does it mean to be greater than your environment? Okay. You wake up in the morning and if you're not being defined by a vision of the future, we for the most part can say that you're left with the memories of your past. Why? Because your environment is made up of objects and things and people and body and places. Okay, so you have a neurological network for all your kids for where you live, your cell phone, the places you lived, every part of your body, your identity, everything in your environment that is known to you is mapped neurologically in your brain.

[01:19:55.100] - Speaker 1
So your brain is a reflection of everything known in your environment, or your brain is a record of the past. It's it's an artifact, right. So because you've experienced every one of these people and every one of these places and objects and things, you have a neurological network associated with it. The end product of experience is emotions. So if you had a series of bad experiences with your best friend, you'll have a series of emotions that are associated with them. So for the most part, then the moment you see your friend, you're going to think equal to everything you know about them, and you're going to feel the same familiar feelings that you felt about them, and how you think and how you feel is your state of being. And as long as you're staying in the same state of being because your environment is influencing your thoughts and feelings, it's then it's no longer that your personality is creating your personal reality. Your personal reality is actually creating your personality, right? And so it makes sense then, then in order for you to change your response to your friend and how you think about them has to change in order for your life to change.

[01:20:58.360] - Speaker 1
Okay. So the environment is very seductive and most people have become very reliant. We become hypnotized into needing something out there to happen, to make us feel an emotion. That's that's the program and the virtual reality experience we need. We need in the simulation. We need an event to occur. And the end product of the experience is the emotion. Nothing wrong with that. And it feels great in three dimensional reality. Okay. All right. But what if you're going to sit and be defined by a vision of the future and you want to create. Okay. So it would make sense then that you would have to close your eyes and disconnect from your environment. And you do that. You have less stimulation coming into your brain. And now you're in a world can start to become more real than your outer world. Okay. And then you're sitting there and you've got to be able to be greater than your body like it wants to get up. It wants to lay down. It wants to quit.

[01:21:47.370] - Speaker 1
Okay. You got to know that that's your body just being an unbridled horse. You got to you got to work with it. You got to train it, and you got to keep settling it down. That's the victory right there. That's overcoming the animal self. Okay? So you got to be greater than the body. And it would make sense then that in a meditation. Then in order for you to focus on really you, you couldn't be focusing on your body or your pain or whatever. You got to get beyond that. And if you're really interested in creating something unknown, you couldn't be living in the predictable future as the brain is living in as an anticipation machine. And you can't keep recalling the past because that's the known as well. So the familiar past is the known. The predictable future is unknown. Okay, we said earlier, the unknown is the present moment. Okay, so we use meditation as a great way to get beyond your body, your environment and time. And we And we discovered that when people take all of their attention off their body.

[01:22:44.950] - Speaker 1
All of their attention off all the people in their life that they identify with. No longer be that identity. All the objects and things, all the places they need to. Be the places they've been. The places they're sitting. They forget about time. In and of itself. When they become nobody. No one, no thing, no where and no time. That is the moment they become pure consciousness. That is an elegant moment where they are aware of nothing but self. That that is the door into possibility right there. That is the unknown. We discover that when people move into the state, there are dramatic changes that take place in the brain. When we live in stress and survival and we're aroused and we're trying to control and predict everything in our life, we shift our attention from one person to another person to another problem, to another object, to another thing, to another place, to another meeting. All those neurological networks in the Networks in the brain that have been individualized related to those knowns.

[01:23:42.530] - Speaker 1
Like a lightning storm in the clouds starts firing out of order. And when the brain is incoherent or incoherent and as you said, we get very obsessed. We get very single minded. We get over focused. Your brain goes actually into a very aroused, not beta brainwave state, high beta brainwave state, like three times as high as normal beta. So now you're obsessing and you're analyzing your life and your problem within that emotion, and you're actually making your brain worse, right? We discovered that when people take their attention off their body, their environment and time and open their awareness, just simply relax, relax and open up and change their brainwaves and go from beta to alpha to theta and kind of give them steps to be able to practice and practice opening up that door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind, and keep working on their analytical mind if you're able to do that. And we can Use that as a model. We can see dramatic changes that take place in the brain. So we take a group of people, hundreds sometimes, sometimes more.

[01:24:46.150] - Speaker 1
And we do quantitative EEG. We put 3638 stations on their brain. We measure the brain before they come to the event. We put them through seven days of intense training. We measure the brain at the end of it, and there's dramatic changes in modulation, orderliness in the brain. There's coherence in the brain. The brain seems to be way more balanced. Okay, so when you're frustrated, when you're impatient, when you're judgmental, your heart beats way out of order. Okay, so if we practiced our feeling heart centered emotions, could we make your heart beat more orderly? The answer is yes. And so we do measurements of hrvs. We measure what before they start a meditation. If they're going to create, they got to be in their heart. They can't be in survival. So let's measure to see if you're able to sustain that, not just for five minutes, Let's make it a skill. Let's see if you can do that for 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes. Get really good at doing it with your eyes closed.

[01:25:42.010] - Speaker 1
Let's do it with your eyes open. Let's try that out. Right. Okay, so now if we do that properly, we also draw blood on a thousand people or 800 people. And we draw blood at the end to see if there's changes in there in thousands of metabolites, over 2800 metabolites. But let's take some people and let's measure their brain in real time during a meditation. Let's see what's going on in the inner workings in the brain. And let's look for certain specific patterns that can be correlated. Now, I've learned so much in looking at real time brains. Really, I know the music now that causes people to move into that beautiful, beautiful state of receptivity. I know the sound of my voice. I know the words now that actually can get people further along into this. I'm not saying that like I've discovered anything that anybody.

[01:26:35.550] - Speaker 2
Else could just reading the data.

[01:26:36.710] - Speaker 1
We're just looking at the data, you know, and that's kind of another funny thing because people say to me, are you telling me meditation can do this or that? Or you're telling me? And I say, actually, I'm not saying that anymore. The data is saying that. I'm not saying that I can't even say this as pseudoscience anymore. My scientists that we work with were doubters. Yes, they were huge doubters. They were like, this is not possible. And now they're all in. They they have a little closet in the lab where they all go to meditate. I mean, they see it as medicine. That's how they see it. They, they, they've done the they've done the study. So so we look at these brain scans in, in real time and, and um, so many interesting things happen where there's coherence in the brain. And this is kind of your world. Right? So if you get things coherent and they're in a closed system and waves are orderly when they interfere.

[01:27:33.530] - Speaker 1
Waves start bouncing on other waves and they get resonance. And resonance is just a greater level of order where things are more complex and there's more systems within order. Right. Keep doing that. And all of a sudden you get the brain firing in a level that's outside of what's normal, like the amount of water in the brain when this occurs. Um, so the data says like we use about 5 or 4 or 6% of our brain when we're just hanging out, talking, you feel your legs, you listening to what I'm saying? And at one time when you see this moment where they hit this point of resonance that creates this kind of this coupling in the brain, you're looking at 25 to 26% of brain fully hooked up and online. Right. So the person is having a very, very elegant moment. So we look at the real time scans and we look to see how we can teach Each it better. How we can find the right way. Find the right music. Find the right words.

[01:28:33.670] - Speaker 1
And of course, it's a never ending process of discovery, which I. I don't know what else to do. What else I would be doing. But but it really is pretty wild to see. So we measure the microbiome and we have such an amazing community of people because you got 1000 people in the study, 800 people are giving a microbiome sample before and after the event and our data just on the microbiome, just in terms of what's possible and what can change in seven days, you'd have to change your diet and you'd have to do a lot of really, really big things, lifestyle wise, to see some of these changes in the phylum of microbiomes that we're discovering. And again, it's incredible data where the correlation between cancer growth and microbiome, there's changes in that and and response to cancer treatment with certain microbiomes and and inflammation. And we're just seeing these great changes taking place. And you know the know, the idea of the microbiome is kind of like the body is really influencing the mind.

[01:29:31.530] - Speaker 1
You know, it's influencing the mind to do certain things to keep at, you know, a community.

[01:29:39.410] - Speaker 2
Of cells.

[01:29:40.210] - Speaker 1
Ecosystem, ecosystem, either in order or disorder. Right. So in this case, somehow the mind is influencing the body, right? You're seeing the mind change those microorganisms for greater sense of hosting, the greater sense of of balance. Um, we've worked with um, gene expression. Uh, no doubt you can change your genes in, in four days. We did a study on telomeres, and, uh, we found out that three out of four people, if they did meditation, uh, five out of seven days a week, uh, that there would be some lengthening of their telomeres. So three out of four, that's that's pretty good.

[01:30:19.250] - Speaker 2
60 days are all the tests that you're doing based on guided meditations. Yeah. It's all guided.

[01:30:24.450] - Speaker 1
Meditation. Yeah. So yeah. And so. The when we run our events, our idea is like okay really simple. There was a Harvard researcher that took a group of men in their 70s and 80s to a monastery north of Harvard, and she asked them to pretend that they were 22 years younger. Right. Not not reminisce, but actually pretend that they were 22 years younger. Think differently, act differently, feel differently. Okay. She put pictures of Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedy brothers, you know, and Nat King Cole and, you know, created the whole scene to remind them. And and then she did a bunch of measurements on them. She measured their height and their weight, and she measured their cognition and their finger lengths and toe lengths, their gait, their range of motion, a host of different biological tests on them. And then at the end of five days in the monastery, she remeasured everything and their finger lengths were longer, their toe lengths were longer, their brains work better by 60%, cognition improved by 60%, their gait was changed so they could see better.

[01:31:23.700] - Speaker 1
They could hear better. There's really significant changes. So we think of this seven day event like those men going to the monastery. You can become anybody you want to be. Yeah right. And all you have to do is believe, behave and become. Right. So we do seated meditations. It's important to get really good at getting beyond space and time. You got to make your inner world more real than your outer world. And we got to practice getting really good at that. Okay. But then if you can open your heart sitting down and you can open your minds sitting down, let's practice it standing up. So let's go out and take 1800 people and get on a beach somewhere in Mexico at six in the morning for the sunrise, and you got 800 people opening their hearts and greeting the day as the upgraded version of themselves, the greatest expression of the divine right. And then get in that state, standing up like you would do sitting down. Now open your eyes. And now it's rehearsal time.

[01:32:19.840] - Speaker 1
Now you got to embody this person. And how would you walk if you knew that you could heal in one hour? How would you walk if you knew you could change your life in one hour? And so people go fully, fully in. And so now they're they're they're practicing embodying the energy, the emotion, the behavior, the posture, the feeling of who they want to be in their future. And, and we have different walking meditations that are guided based on whatever we're working on. Right. So, so then let's, let's stand as it and walk as it, so that you get in the habit of walking like that in your life and get real good at doing it with your eyes open. Right. So you can practice right. And on the stage here. Okay. So what about the mystical. So we see that the, the greatest number of mystical changes happens when people lay down. And if I can keep them in that world between when they're half awake and they're half asleep and kind of touch them here and there, bring them back a little bit and then breathe a little bit and get them right there.

[01:33:18.540] - Speaker 1
And then keep having them focus on different things while they're laying down, they'll they'll have a profound moment. So we do as much as we can in seven days, and really spending the whole time in the monastery to practice becoming who you want to be. So when you return back into your life, you don't default so quickly and forget, and it's so much easier to forget this stuff than to remember it. So the last thing about the brain scans? We did some fmris in San Diego last year, and it was really cool to see the neuroscientists talk to me about this, because he was showing us a part of the brain in seven days that actually grew in volume. Wow. In seven days. I know it's crazy for me to even say this, and it's that part of the brain that is the default system where you actually can catch yourself thinking about or predicting the next moment in the future. If you keep practicing not doing that, you know, and you can keep practicing. Returning back to the present moment, you'll actually build the muscle.

[01:34:22.980] - Speaker 1
You'll actually build a whole new volume, a whole new real estate of neurons in your brain that gets you better at that. And what we discovered is when you don't expect anything, the unexpected is going to happen. Yes, we know that now to be the case. And when that unexpected happens, if you look at the brain states in Fmris, it looks a lot like a person having a psilocybin experience. They're varying a very, very altered experience. And then the modulation in the brain is just more orderly and more synchronized. And what syncs in the brain links in the brain. So the person is more integrated. They're more whole. So again, we have so many things we're interested. We have a language scientist that studies transformation. And and we're looking to see when we when people tell their stories of their own transformation and healing, we are looking at the algorithms of language and the word. Feel it or felt it is such a the number one word for people to either have a very somatic like I felt it in every cell of my body, or a very emotional or very psychic experience of some emotion that was different than the emotion that they typically feel, you know, a very familiar, unfamiliar feeling like that.

[01:35:41.480] - Speaker 1
So. So, um.

[01:35:43.640] - Speaker 2
It's probably like a feeling of, um, coming into themselves that they, they haven't known. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, there's a I imagine even though it's a feeling they haven't experienced before, there's a familiarity in coming into being who they really are. Yeah. Their real their true selves.

[01:36:07.800] - Speaker 1
Well, that's a great conversation. And so I'm kind of a mystic and I and I mean, one of the things that I really believe in is oneness, you know, wholeness. And I think, um, we are wholeness in parts. We're part of the whole. And I think that divine lives in every human being. I think the divine wholeness, oneness one day said, what if there were many instead of one? And this journey to answer the question, who am I? Or is there anything else but oneness is? Everybody has got to the point where they're so separate from everybody, everyone, everything, everywhere, every time. Not connected any longer that they have their own free will to create reality the way they want and answer the question, is there anything else but oneness? And that's the never ending process of discovery. So I feel like in those moments where people have those inevitable feelings, that familiar, unfamiliar feeling is a remembering that they came from source, that they came from pure love.

[01:37:01.140] - Speaker 1
They came from wholeness. They came from undivided wholeness. They came from singularity, zero point, universal mind, unified field, whatever you want to call that invisible field of energy that's connecting and governing all of this material physical world. And and so we noticed that when people put a lot of attention on opening their awareness to nothing and they're aware of nothing but themselves, that workshop, that place is such a profound place for possibility to exist.

[01:37:31.600] - Speaker 2
And that and that place where it's themselves may not be themselves. Singular. Yes, yes. You know, it may be. I am part of this whole.

[01:37:45.080] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yes. No, that is that is exactly what it is. We just had.

[01:37:49.160] - Speaker 2
Some aspect of the whole we just.

[01:37:50.640] - Speaker 1
Had someone send a really great testimonial and she said, I never knew it. Yeah, but I am, I am wholeness, I am that like I, I know that and I think the beauty behind this is nobody's so special to be excluded from it. Right. But when you when you have that moment where I think everybody has to on their way back to source sooner or later, going to run into it. I think the biggest treasure is that you realize that that feeling is you didn't get it from anyone or anything out there. It came from within you. And I think that's where we stop looking for it out there. And then all of a sudden, and I see this, and after so many weeklong events, I look at people and they're walking meditations and their eyes closed and tears of joy are rolling down their face. And I look at them and I know nobody's making them feel that way but them. Like, imagine the freedom we have when we're not relying on anyone or anything to do that.

[01:38:47.970] - Speaker 1
When you're happy with yourself, you're happy with everybody. When you're in love with yourself, you're in love with everybody. I mean that that, that moment that person is actually worthy to receive. They are worthy in that moment, to receive. I mean, I think the universe only gives us what we think we're worthy of receiving and practicing that connection every single day. What part of my limited self am I willing to surrender to get closer to that greater self, that place of source or oneness and wholeness? And I think it's a good journey.

[01:39:21.070] - Speaker 2
How does the unfolding continue for you? Like at the time of the placebo book, that was your first book? Yes. Third book, placebo was your third book? Yes. That's the first one I read. Okay. Well, tell me the whole history of the books.

[01:39:34.710] - Speaker 1
Oh, gosh. So I wrote a book called Evolve Your Brain The Science of Changing Your Mind. I think when you you write your first book, you write to your greatest critic. So a lot of neuroscience, a lot of heavy science. It's about the science of changing your mind and plasticity, really. Then, you know, after I wrote that book and after some documentaries, a lot of people asked me, how do you do it? Right? And so I wrote the second book called Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself How to Lose Your Mind and Create.

[01:39:58.590] - Speaker 2
A New Title.

[01:39:59.150] - Speaker 1
I love it, and that's a practical application, really. I think it's the time in history where it's not enough to know. I think it's a time in history to know how. So finally, people are interested in the practical application. Okay, so then we started doing measurements. Uh, right around that time. And the only reason I did measurements, Rick, was because I was watching people step out of wheelchairs, and I was just kind of like, oh, okay. Like, what is that? And then I started looking at the science of the placebo, and I got super fascinated with the idea. Oh my God, I am so programed. I am so programed into needing something outside of me, and these people are doing it without us. So we started doing brain scans and hrvs and gene expression tests and immune regulation tests. Trade. Trade. What a certain emotion. For an elevated emotion, your immune system gets stronger, a lot stronger, you know. So we started doing all these tests, you know, just because I wanted to see if you understood the science of the placebo, what it is, it's conditioning, it's expectation and assigning meaning to things.

[01:40:54.730] - Speaker 1
Do you really need the sugar pill or the saline injection or the false treatment?

[01:40:59.410] - Speaker 2
It's the belief.

[01:41:00.730] - Speaker 1
You are actually selecting a new potential in the quantum field that says, I could get better. And if the doctor really works it, you could actually get optimistic. You could get grateful. You combine that clear intention with an elevated emotion. You're changing that person's state of being, and the body will begin to anticipate the event and make the exact pharmacy of chemicals equal to the substance they think they're taking. They're making their own antidepressants. They're making their own anticarcinogens. They're their own morphine, their own dopamine by thought alone. Okay. So you need this. You need the sugar pill and.

[01:41:31.670] - Speaker 2
The right ones. Not not the guesstimation. Exactly. It's the the ones needed.

[01:41:37.230] - Speaker 7
That is the.

[01:41:38.270] - Speaker 1
Exact pharmacy of chemicals. We just did a study. Remind me to tell you about this study after I finished this. So we started seeing the brain scans. We started seeing people with Parkinson's and all kinds of things change. We started doing all kinds of experiments. And then, um, my last book was Becoming Supernatural How Common People Are Doing the Uncommon. And that's really kind of a look into the seven day, week long events. You know, we've done almost 40 of them now around the world. And, um, and really give people some of the tools and some of the applications of what we've done. But here's an example of the placebo. We did a study just recently where we took, uh, 70 meditators in a weeklong event and divided them into two different categories. In one category, we had these people, at the end of certain meditations, focus on five proteins and five gene expressions that could actually be enhanced. And they were actually real genes and real proteins. And then we asked the other 35 or so to focus on these five genes and proteins.

[01:42:44.250] - Speaker 1
And four out of the five were made up genes and proteins that we just made up names. They didn't exist, but there was one that was common to both of them, right. So. When we measured the effects of the people who actually had the intention of elevating the genes that did exist and the proteins, this one particular one that we studied first is called serpentine. A5 was elevated in 100% of the people. They had no idea what the gene or the protein was. Um, they don't know the molecular formula. They don't know how to make it their intellect. And they were instructed to not look it up. They were just just there was a little short course in gene expression. And that's what that's what they were told to do. Okay. So the order went in. And when they put in the order and there were five real substances, we didn't measure the other four yet. We're still looking at them. But the one that we were that was common to both of them definitely went up when we put in the fake order, where there were four out of the five that that didn't exist, the autonomic nervous system said cancel the order and it decreased the amount of serpentine A5 in the in the other study.

[01:43:56.070] - Speaker 1
So there is this innate intelligence that we cannot overlook.

[01:44:02.990] - Speaker 8
Look.

[01:44:03.570] - Speaker 1
I said to the scientists, let's think about this, okay? Is it possible, then, if we could raise this in person? Doesn't know what it is. They can raise the dopamine levels. Could they raise their growth hormone levels? Could they change their estrogen levels, their immunoglobulin levels? Is there if we understand this, what couldn't it work for? If people don't even have to know what the substance does, they can just be told what to do. And the autonomic nervous system creates a pharmacy of chemicals to match the orders or the intentions. So I don't know where we're going with it, but it was interesting to see that, yes, there is some type of assignment, once accepted, that innately begins to produce amazing pharmacies. Yeah.

[01:44:49.610] - Speaker 2
Would you say all illness is psychosomatic?

[01:44:54.610] - Speaker 1
I would say that the majority of diseases are lifestyle. I would say the majority of health conditions are habits, choices, and behaviors. I think a very small percentage is actually inherently genetic. Um, but if you think about this, um, stress is when your brain and body are knocked out of homeostasis. When it's knocked out of balance, knocked out of order, the stress response is what your body innately does. Return itself back to order. Right. So that's an innate mechanism of the autonomic nervous system to maintain order. But if you're being chased by a T-Rex, it's not a time for order. It's time to mobilize all the resources for the for the danger. And that's when the body moves out of balance. Okay. So you have physical stress, traumas, injuries, accidents, falls. You have chemical stress, pesticides, pollutants, hangovers, you know, allergies, whatever. Um, toxins. And then you have emotional stress, right. And psychological and emotional stress seems to be the difficult one.

[01:45:56.630] - Speaker 1
75 to 90% of every person that walks into a healthcare care facility in the Western world who walks in because of emotional and psychological stress. So it seems like this psychological and emotional component to things somehow causes the body to regress back to a past pattern to a past state. Okay, so it makes sense then, that if you have three types of disorder physical, chemical and emotional, then it must mean you have three types of order physical, chemical, and emotional. Now, the reason I'm telling you this is because we've had numerous people come to this work where the cancer treatment, the chemo wasn't working, the drug trial wasn't working, the radiation didn't work, the surgery didn't work. The five different diets that they were doing didn't work. And some of them were physicians. Some of them were researchers. Some of them were single mothers. You know, it didn't matter. But the bottom line is they realized that nothing was changing because they weren't changing. And so when nothing else works and you're doing all the right things physically, and you're doing all the right things chemically, and you're taking your vitamins and your herbs and all that stuff, and you're eating, making the right.

[01:47:05.780] - Speaker 1
But nothing's changing. There's just one thing left, and that is that emotional response, because a lot of people that do this work and they say, okay, I'm going to practice, I'm going to become somebody else, and they really work on it. Um, in the beginning, they noticed their pain levels drop. They notice they're sleeping better through the night. They notice that they're digesting food better, but they still have their disease. The condition is still there, but they don't say it didn't work. What they say is, what haven't I changed about myself in order for it to work? So what it typically is. Is their emotional response. And remember, the emotion is the end product of the experience and the environment. So if they react to their ex in the same way or to their coworker in the same way, sooner or later you're going to realize this isn't loving to me because I'm signaling the same gene. So now it gets very practical. Yeah. Now they're not saying, okay, let me do my meditation to heal.

[01:48:04.520] - Speaker 1
They're like, oh my God. I got to remind myself that when I get in the presence of my ex, what would love do? Like what would be a greater way to be. How? Let me think. What piece of knowledge, what piece of philosophy, what piece of information could I apply and let me rehearse how I'm going to be so I can have a different experience. Evolve my day, evolve my experience today, right? So. So now they start practicing doing it more for the for the practical application of being able to manage their emotional state. Right. Because the default back the one hour of a great meditation against the 16 hours of living by the same emotion, they can't expect it. They're not saying it isn't changing. They're like, no, no, no, no, it's me. Yes. Oh God, it's me I fu I spent the majority of my day, I forgot again, okay, I got to remember. I got to remember now so I don't forget.

[01:48:55.860] - Speaker 1
Right. And so, so the chronic health condition will change a lot of times in the beginning, because the person's starting to self-regulate and starting to bring their autonomic nervous system back into balance with their meditations. But if they get up and they're in traffic and they're angry and they're judgmental and whatever else unworthy, um, you can guarantee then the remainder of their day they're back to that old personality. So as people begin to overcome the emotions, I think, um, when you master your emotions, you master your creations. You know, I think that's the way it is. And I think when you overcome the emotions that are connected to the past, a memory without the emotional charge is called wisdom. And you're ready now. You're ready for a new game. You're ready for a new opportunity. You know that you know now. And you your response to the memory or to the condition no longer has that emotional charge. You've got the wisdom now. And now the soul's ready for the next adventure.

[01:49:47.900] - Speaker 1
It's for the ready for the next dream, the next creation. You know, because you can't you can't go to that future if you're hanging on to the emotion of I don't care how positive you think, you could say I'm healthy and wealthy and free. I'm unlimited. And that thought is going to stop right at the brain stem. And the body's saying, no, you're not. You're miserable. You're unhappy. It's not going to make it into the body. So then what is the state that you get your body into that it can receive information. And we discovered gratitude just happens to be that emotion. Because the emotional signature of gratitude when you receive something, when you just receive something, when something favorable is happening to you or something amazing just happened to you, the emotion you feel is gratitude. So the emotional signature of gratitude is something just happened. Really wonderful or something is happening to me really wonderfully. So it's signature is receivership right? So get a person to get beyond their hatred, their impatience, their anger, their suffering, and stop feeling those emotions.

[01:50:50.440] - Speaker 1
Start feeling gratitude. The body is so objective. In a state of gratitude, it actually believes the condition is changing. When? Now. Now. So? So the body starts moving out of that state of imbalance. So I can't say that every disease is created in a certain way. I can say that you can have a gene. And we've seen this for a certain health condition and never signal it, because you're managing your inward state so that you don't signal that gene by feeling that same emotion. And I think if you you can program it to work for you if you keep practicing it.

[01:51:29.740] - Speaker 2
I think the last thing I want to ask this is a good one. I'm excited about this. I can't wait to hear what you say. Is, um, is there a limit to what we can train ourselves or program ourselves to be able to do? For example, bilocation levitation? Uh, no. All knowledge. Are there any boundaries to where we can go with this?

[01:51:55.120] - Speaker 1
Mm mm. So I'm a pragmatist. I'm a very practical person. So, um, I think it's a never ending process of discovery. I think it's has to be methodical. Um, the person who truly, really says, okay, I created this health condition. I have to uncreate it. It's a chilling moment when you you have to do that by yourself. And nobody's believing in you but you. Right. And and if you don't show up, it means you don't believe in you. So you got to show up, right? So that has an enormous amount of energy and awareness. But let's just say the person goes through a process and they start healing themselves. As I said, the experience of healing yourself produces a new feeling, a new emotion. That's that's the end product of you love yourself more. You feel it blessed. You Blessed you feel your life. You're looking at beauty now in life instead of pain, right? So a lot of times when people have those transcendental experiences by their own personal transformations, next thing is, can we heal somebody else?

[01:53:02.180] - Speaker 1
And we now know that we can. In fact, I was with the scientist the other day and I said, when in your lifetimes did you think you would be talking about coherence, healings and the effects on inflammation, on pain, on insomnia? How would that work? Just as well as a drug and the person is even being touched? They're like, we can't believe it. Okay, so let's get a group of people together and give them the science about the quantum physics, about how matter is created, and see if we could really have them change the field and if they could change matter. Now we have, as I said, we have so many testimonials. We have so much great data on that. We know that it's insanely powerful. Okay, so Covid happens. And now a group, people say, all right, let's evolve our model. Um, in the quantum, there's no separation, right? So do we actually need to be in the presence of the person to do the healing?

[01:53:56.510] - Speaker 1
Can we evolve our model a little further and do it remotely? All we need is a target. We need an image. We just need a symbol. And we can collectively connect beyond space and time to that person's field. Right. Is it possible, then, that we could produce those effects remotely? And the answer is yes, of course. Of course. And we have the data now. We have the data to suggest that's possible. Now here's the important point. You can't truly believe or even ask the question until you have the experience, because the experience then opens you up to something you never would have thought of. Because without the experience, you're unaware of it, right? So the experience now has caused people to go, oh my God, we're actually healing people remotely. We've got the data, we got the gene expression, we got the microbiome. Now we got all this crazy data. Like the answer is yes. Okay, so then let's keep building that model even further.

[01:54:52.690] - Speaker 1
And let's see. Do I think theoretically it's possible? Levitation. Uh, disappearing and reappearing, I. Theoretically, absolutely. Are we. Are we that good yet? No. But is it is it possible? Yes, it actually, it actually is, in fact. So then I think we have to we have to if we're going to go to the moon. Yes. We got to get really good at the process and keep stretching the model. So what we do know is we do these advanced follow ups to answer your question, and I build a model that's way outside of that model that they're typically used to. But these people are not just going down the slopes once a year. They're they're actually going down the slopes every day. So they're doers. They do the work. Let's build a bigger model. Let's see if we can produce the same biological changes as a result that we just need one. We just need one. And one means it's possible. And of course. So theoretically, my interest is to be able to see how far I could evolve that model in in my lifetime.

[01:55:56.310] - Speaker 2
Fantastic. That's a great. I'm excited to see what I'm I'm ecstatic with where you've gotten so far, and I can't wait to see where it goes. Yeah.

[01:56:04.350] - Speaker 1
Me too. I mean, as I said, I keep telling the scientists like, I can't believe this is the truth. And and and not in a way that, like, I've discovered the truth. It's just that we're discovering a part of the truth that's I think is really so valuable. And so. So then the person who participates in their own treatment now, by managing their emotional state, by imagining and by managing their own thoughts and catching themselves speaking in certain ways, I don't think we have any idea where we're going. Here's an example. I was interviewed for this For this documentary a little ways back, and I can't keep track of all of the healings, you know, like but I but I they send them to me because to me that's feedback that we're we're making a difference. Right. So I'm doing this documentary and the, the, the interviewer had just been with a scientific team and she, she said, and have you heard of this woman, so-and-so, who who grew her thyroid back?

[01:57:11.250] - Speaker 1
I know this is insane. And I'm on I'm on camera. And I was like, what? Like I frowned and scowled, and I was like, what do you mean no, you didn't hear about you don't know anything. I said, I don't know what are you talking about? No. She grew her thyroid back. What do you mean? She grew her thyroid back? She grew her thyroid back. I'm like, I'm on the camera, like arguing with her. Because now my belief.

[01:57:35.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah, is being stressed.

[01:57:37.850] - Speaker 1
I'm like, no How could that be? How is that possible, then? You know, that bothered me the whole day. I kept thinking, how in the world could this person grow another time? So I hear the story that she had a lot of really, really intense symptoms. Uh, you know, with, with a thyroid condition. And she went to the doctor. Big tumor on there. Took the tumor out, and the doctor said, you're going to be on this drug, which for the normal. Yeah. For what's natural. Yes, that's the truth. Yes. We study normal. Yes. But somehow she just was not going to accept living on a drug for the rest of her life, that somehow she was going to work on changing that outcome. And so she did the work every day, and she just the right personality type that got fully into it. And and then she started having all these symptoms, and she went to her doctor. And the medications that she was taking were driving her values way too high.

[01:58:36.870] - Speaker 1
So the doctor said, come off your medication just to see what your values are. So she comes off the medications and her her thyroid values are within normal limits. So the doctor says this is really great. And then, you know, in a matter of time, how how could that be? How could that be? So they sent her for a scan. And there's the thyroid, right.

[01:58:58.050] - Speaker 2
So so regeneration.

[01:59:01.170] - Speaker 7
Like like.

[01:59:02.370] - Speaker 1
Because I think the information about everything, physical and material is in the field and that, that, that the information about a thyroid in terms of frequency and energy exists in the field. And it's the field that creates matter, right? So is it possible that you can change information in the field, a pattern, a blueprint that could actually cause a hologram to appear in three dimensional reality. So so you have an experience like that? I watched the testimonial ten times I had to watch it because I could not believe it. I watched the testimonial of the kid that came to the event with muscular dystrophy in a wheelchair. I watched it 50 times. I kept this guy was so incredibly full of life. He was so authentic. He was on his feet. He was saying, I'm on my feet. My my balance is next level. I, I have no doubt I had a tiny doubt. I have no doubt now what's possible. I have no doubt. Like this. He had his moment.

[02:00:10.990] - Speaker 1
You know he had his moment. So I had to watch that that particular testimonial over and over again. And I never got tired of watching it. I heard it differently every time I listened to it. He was I was changing my belief. I love when the scientists run the same study five times in a row, or five different ways to try to disprove it, and it and we keep getting the same outcome. I know, yeah, I know they're changing their belief in that moment, so I think. I think if you have human testimony, there's there's nothing like a good. Story. And you have science that's actually supporting you can make your brain work better. You can make your heart work better. You can make your genes switch on. You can strengthen your immune system. You can change your microbiome. Uh, you know, we have you could change energy in the field. You can change outcomes, you know, and you have that kind of evidence and science and that evidence and testimony.

[02:01:08.770] - Speaker 1
I think evidence is the loudest voice. I think people are looking for that right now. And so we only do the best with what we think is available. And to become conscious of what's possible and see that four minute mile.

[02:01:21.010] - Speaker 2
I love that you you get to have that experience of disbelief, of like that. That can't be. Yeah, I love that. I love that it keeps.

[02:01:28.450] - Speaker 1
Me up at night and that's.

[02:01:29.770] - Speaker 2
Fantastic.

[02:01:30.730] - Speaker 7
It's fantastic.

[02:01:32.290] - Speaker 1
And that causes me to ask greater questions about scientific studies that we want to do. And boy, you should sit in on some of those conversations in the scientific studies and just really, really I, I want to know how is this possible? I love it. I want to know how it's possible. Why is that important? Because the mechanistic model needs an upgrade. It it no longer has the same value it once had. There's got to be a new model that's put into place. So what's the side effect of this? Well, we're talking to the medical school at the university that we're doing our research with. They're asking us, how do we teach this to doctors? How do we bring this into the operating room? Do we have intention? Do we do we elevate our state? Um, can we connect to the patient? Can we can we hold an outcome? You know, like.

[02:02:30.780] - Speaker 7
God bless us if this is possible.

[02:02:33.200] - Speaker 1
If this model actually changes, it'll be care introduced back into health care. You know, maybe it'll be something else. And um, and again, if we're just kind of at that infantile state, but, but I think each experience then causes us to change our belief in what's possible. And I think, um.

[02:02:52.280] - Speaker 2
It builds on itself.

[02:02:53.480] - Speaker 7
Yeah.

[02:02:53.800] - Speaker 2
It's beautiful. I want to ask, in the placebo book, you told the story of an accident you had where you rebuilt your spine, and you didn't have you as a teacher to guide you to do that. How was your life that allowed you to make the choice of not listening to the surgeons, who only know one way, and to believe that you could heal yourself? And you did. How did it.

[02:03:26.920] - Speaker 7
Happen? Uh, okay.

[02:03:28.760] - Speaker 1
So, um, when I went to undergraduate school, it was pre-med, and my head was very much into the academic world. Um, but I, I started doing yoga and martial arts, uh, instead of doing traditional sports that I had done my whole life. Uh, just because I just ran into a couple people that were just a little different, and somehow it worked for me. And so I just started reading a lot of different sects, and it opened my mind up. And I was passing through a I was taking an abnormal psychology class. I was passing through the lecture hall there, and I saw on the the corkboard where they used to put those things on the corkboard, learn why you sleep. And I was just like, I just ripped that thing off. And I thought, I'm taking 21 credits this semester, 19 credits this semester. I'm nuts. Uh, if I could learn how I could sleep, I would help me out. And so. It was about hypnosis, self hypnosis, and how to program your mind.

[02:04:26.380] - Speaker 1
And I had, Uh, two three different college roommates that were fabulous. They were sleep talkers and sleepwalkers. Wow. I mean, they were deep state guys. They were.

[02:04:37.040] - Speaker 7
The odds they would.

[02:04:37.880] - Speaker 1
Talk to each other while they were asleep.

[02:04:39.400] - Speaker 7
Unbelievable.

[02:04:39.960] - Speaker 1
And I was reading all these books on hypnosis, and I thought, I bet you I could hypnotize these guys. And I would hypnotize these guys all the time. And it was just it just turned into this fun thing. And I read every book on hypnosis. And so when I went to graduate school, I thought I picked up the book autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, Drive Down to Atlanta. And when I was reading that book, um, I was interested also in the idea of being able to go through graduate school, go to class instead of my mind wander. I want to pay attention 100%, and I want to learn everything in the class so I don't have to study so I can do things that I want to do, like get my black belt and do other things and do yoga. And and so I started practicing really programing my mind to mind to pay attention and to learn so I didn't have to take notes. And I would review the lectures in my mind, and I practice that way.

[02:05:32.300] - Speaker 1
So then I would read a reference before the test, and I was good, and I was able to have other time to do other things, like, like, like things I wanted to do.

[02:05:39.860] - Speaker 7
Great idea.

[02:05:40.420] - Speaker 2
By the way.

[02:05:41.380] - Speaker 7
No great idea.

[02:05:42.020] - Speaker 1
And I got better at it as I did it. And I realized that you could do it. So then I decided that I wanted to, to, um, to do something with hypnosis. So I went to the Hypnosis Motivation Institute in Norcross, Georgia, while I was going to school and took my father would have killed me if he knew this, but I took my student loan and I put it towards this, this, this getting clinically certified, and we're four levels. And I was only gonna do the first level, and I wound up doing all four levels until I was a clinical hypnotherapist. And then I basically just had a great, uh, way to practice while I was going to school. And I started working in this holistic healing center, and I started working with fears and phobias and learning and memory and gifted and talented kids and bulimia and everything you could imagine alcoholism, smoking. And I started seeing like, people changing, like in a matter of seconds. And I was just kind of like, what the hell?

[02:06:38.320] - Speaker 1
Like, what the hell? But at the same time, reading Paramahansa Yogananda and some of these spiritual, like, these guys doing some type of hypnosis where they can actually program their, their mind and body to do things, you know. How does the Sand Swami stay buried under sand with his head down for three months? Like what? What's happening there? So I had this interest in the mystical East at that time, at 19, 20 year old kid. And at the same time, I had this, you know, strong interest in kind of the mind and psychology and all that other stuff. And so I started doing yoga like three hours a day, like from four in the morning till seven in the morning. I was crazy, and I just wanted to really figure out what the yogis knew, the breathing, the whole bit. And, um, so I went through I got my martial arts, black belt. I did yoga studio, and then I moved to San Diego and, um, and then I just got exposed to a whole world that I was that I didn't really know about.

[02:07:34.060] - Speaker 1
And I started doing triathlons, and I was in this triathlon, and I was in the biking portion of the race, and the police officer was kind of like egging me on. He was waving me on to make the turn. And but he had his back to the oncoming traffic. And I was passing these two cyclists on the turn. And because he had his back to the oncoming traffic, he didn't know that there was a four wheel drive Bronco going. And so when I made the turn, the moment I made the turn, I got just catapulted out of my bike by this car going 55 miles an hour. And so I landed on my back and, and I broke six vertebrae in my spine. And, uh, and so the typical, um, procedure for that is Harrington rod surgery. The problem was the top vertebrae. The sixth, the eighth thoracic thoracic vertebrae was was more than 60% collapsed, and the neural arch where the spinal cord passed through. Had kind of broken like a pretzel.

[02:08:27.200] - Speaker 1
So I had you break those columns of the vertebrae. The volume goes somewhere. So it went back on my, my, my spinal cord. And I had a kind of compression of the cord.

[02:08:35.920] - Speaker 2
So excruciating.

[02:08:38.000] - Speaker 7
Pain I couldn't.

[02:08:39.040] - Speaker 1
Feel it, really. I felt pain in certain places, but I had a lot of sensory and motor problems at the time. But, I mean, I did hurt in a lot of places. Um, and so the typical surgery is to screw off, just cut off the back parts of the entire vertebrae, in my case, would be the base of my neck to the base of my spine, and then take these stainless steel rods and administer them into the spine. And as you drill them into the into the matter, it could cantilever the spine off the cord. And, and then you could hopefully function. So they said you might be paralyzed the rest of your life. You're definitely not going to be able to do anything you used to do. You know, I'm 20 something year old kid and I'm just thinking, oh my God, my life is over as I know it. I was very active, you know, and and very doing, living a great life in San Diego, you know.

[02:09:27.290] - Speaker 1
And so, um, we got four opinions from four of the leading surgeons in Southern California, two in Palm Springs, two at Scripps Hospital in San Diego. And definitively they said, Harrington rod surgery or you probably won't walk again. So I just remember, um, watching this one doctor watch me take my time and not making the decision as quickly as he thought I should. And I think in the 80s, you really didn't tell a doctor?

[02:09:55.890] - Speaker 7
No, no, you just.

[02:09:56.850] - Speaker 1
Don't say that. So luckily, I had this sweet, sweet Italian father that was just so supportive of whatever I would do. So, um, I had all my friends around, and I was getting my last opinion from the surgeon, and he was like, yeah, maybe we can put eight in stainless steel rods in your spine instead of 12 inch and maybe leave them in for a few years and then take them out and put four inch stainless steel. And I was just like, oh my God. And I said to the doctor, don't you think that would limit motion in my thoracic spine? I was doing yoga and martial arts. He said, oh, you don't have any motion in your thoracic spine? And I looked at him and it was the moment something clicked and I was like, oh, maybe you don't have any motion in your thoracic spine. But somehow I thought, oh my God, I don't know if I want a carpenter in there kind of putting things together. Now, I'm not saying that Harrington rod surgery isn't indicated, but this was me.

[02:10:46.430] - Speaker 7
Yeah.

[02:10:46.830] - Speaker 2
No.

[02:10:47.150] - Speaker 7
Very interesting.

[02:10:48.190] - Speaker 2
Interesting. So he said something that you knew not to be true.

[02:10:52.390] - Speaker 7
Yeah.

[02:10:52.590] - Speaker 1
He said you don't have any motion in your thoracic spine. He was about 100 pounds overweight, 200 pounds overweight. And I just thought, oh my God, I can reach back and grab my ankles. When my back was super flexible, right? I was very into yoga, so something clicked and I was like, I know a lot about the spine. I just, I can't do this. And, um, and so I had one night where I had to make a decision because if you wait past this point, then they have to cut you open from the front and the back. And it was it was just a crazy thing. So I think the worst of human suffering at times is indecision. So I was weighing what I knew against what I didn't know really, and I couldn't find any evidence of anybody doing it. And, you know, you're in trouble in your life when all your friends and these were doctors and people that I knew were surrounding my bed. You know, when you're in trouble in your life, when people pat you on the shoulder and they say, we know you'll make the right choice.

[02:11:40.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Which really means I'm so glad I'm not you. Yeah, that's what that means. And so for me, I was just I was like, I just decided, like, I saw so many amazing things in seeing people with in self-hypnosis heal from all kinds of things. I saw instantaneous changes in people's mind and body, and I was just like, I got to roll the dice. I got to roll the dice right? And I was, I don't know if I was young enough or arrogant or something about me. It was just. And of course, they thought.

[02:12:09.490] - Speaker 2
I had seen enough. You had seen enough things that didn't make sense.

[02:12:15.150] - Speaker 7
Yeah.

[02:12:16.270] - Speaker 2
To the. That wouldn't make sense to the doctors. You saw it happen. So you had enough experience. Luckily, you took off that flier, and luckily you studied hypnosis. And luckily, you know, it's like you, you you were the right. You were in the right place at the right time for this thing to happen.

[02:12:34.950] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I and then I and then I and then I checked out of the hospital and the doctors thought I had a head injury. They really wanted to do a brain scan on me. They thought I had something wrong with me.

[02:12:44.350] - Speaker 7
Because you wouldn't.

[02:12:44.950] - Speaker 2
Do the surgery.

[02:12:45.750] - Speaker 1
Right. And, um. And so I thought two things. Okay, there's an intelligence within me that I know that's way more intelligent than me, that's giving me life. It's present with me all the time. Maybe I'm not present with it. I know the body can heal, but I know that in this case, if I heal in the normal way, I may or may not have all my bodily functions back. But what if I could give this intelligence a template, a design, a plan, if I can give it some orders and stay really present with it and make sure it knows exactly what I want and when I'm clear. Then I'm going to surrender it. This creation, what I'm creating. I can't do this. I'm going to surrender it to a greater mind. Um, could could I possibly reconstruct my spine? I know this was kind of crazy in the 80s. And then I thought, and I'm not going to let any thought slip by my awareness that I don't want to experience.

[02:13:41.570] - Speaker 1
Now, that sounds theoretically really easy, but when you're in crisis, it's impossible. You tend to focus on all the things you don't want to have happen. And instead of all the things you do want to have happen. So I started the process and I thought that it was just this mirror that was that I had to look into, that was present, and I'd have to I would reconstruct with, with a trowel, like I was like building a wall. I'd reconstruct every vertebrae and my mind, then do the next one, and every one was different. I studied the shape of each one and and then I would start off and my mind would go to, what if you're living in a wheelchair? Should I sell my home? What do I do about my practice? And then I would say, you're focusing on what you don't want to have happen instead of what you do. And I start all over again because I that's not what I wanted to see. I wanted to give it the right thing and I wasn't present.

[02:14:31.590] - Speaker 1
Right. So then I would get angry, then I get frustrated, and then I would get worse, and it would take me hours and hours to go inward and reconstruct it. And when I was done, I was never satisfied, you know? So I was always bothered and and so, so six and a half weeks of doing this, I was, I was, I was a mess. It was the darkest night of the soul of my life, you know, and and, uh, six and a half weeks, I wasn't noticing anything. Right. And all of a sudden, I went through the entire rehearsal in my mind without breaking my attention from the start to the very end, and it felt like I just hit a tennis ball in the sweet spot. Something I was like, oh yeah, like whatever that was. And from that point forward, it got easier because it was taking me three hours, two and a half, three hours to do it, because every time I lost my present moment, I'd start over again.

[02:15:27.890] - Speaker 1
And I didn't know that I was learning how to be present in the process. And paying attention is being present, right? So if my attention wandered, I wasn't present right? So I figured it was omnipresent, so I had to be present with it. So I kept starting over again. And then if I got, you know, frustrated now I know. Or impatient. I was in beta brainwave patterns and I was making myself worse. So after six and a half weeks, I just realized nothing was changing. I kind of didn't care any longer if it was going to work or not. I just kind of relaxed into it. And what took me 3.5 hours, it took me 45 minutes. It was just I somehow was firing and wiring the whole time. And then I started noticing like changes in my legs, like, and the moment I moment I noticed the smallest, the smallest, smallest tiny, tiny change. The moment I noticed that I knew I was on to something. Then I was like a dog on a bone.

[02:16:17.950] - Speaker 1
I was like, okay, now I'm going in.

[02:16:20.590] - Speaker 7
With more intuitive feedback. Yeah, as.

[02:16:22.030] - Speaker 1
As soon as I got the feedback, I was like, oh my God, I know something happened and I was patient with myself and I forgot and didn't want to. I'd want to focus on that. I wanted to focus on whatever I was doing. And then I started imagining, oh my God, I would love to get on a surfboard again. Oh my God, I'd love to see the sunset. Oh my God, I'll never take lunch for granted again with my friends. I want to if I could sit on a toilet again, if I could wash myself in a shower. Oh my God. Like I was selecting possibilities and I was excited and I was emotionally embracing. I think I started my body started believing it was living in that future reality, in the present moment. And then ten and a half weeks, I was on my feet like it was.

[02:16:56.110] - Speaker 7
Just like.

[02:16:56.990] - Speaker 1
Something happened and and I was, I was they had this big cast that I had made for me. And I when I just remember the day I just decided to walk, I just knew it knew it was the day. I just got up and I went over to my buddy, who was sleeping with his wife in bed, and I tapped him on the head. He jumped out of bed and I said, him. I'm going home today. I want to go home. And he was like, whoa! You know. And so, um, so during those lonely nights, uh, during those, during that dark night, I just made a deal with myself. And the deal was, if I was ever able to walk again, I'd spend the rest of my life studying the mind, body, connection and mind over matter. And that's what I did. And then I think, you know, after initiation like that, after a wake up call like that, I couldn't go back to small talk any longer.

[02:17:43.760] - Speaker 1
I couldn't go back to things that I just I wasn't the same guy anymore, you know? So and so so I just thought, is there anybody else that ever had anything like this besides me? And so I started studying spontaneous remissions, and I started studying people that were treating conventionally or unconventionally that were staying the same or getting worse from chronic health conditions. And all of a sudden they got better. Now here's the weird part. I started traveling to countries to talk to these people, you know, and really listen. I thought I was going to hear about a diet. I thought I was going to hear about something in particular that was common to all these people, some type of whatever.

[02:18:19.460] - Speaker 7
Yes.

[02:18:20.140] - Speaker 1
And none of that was none of that mattered. It was totally had to do with their mind. It totally had to do with their mind. And so then I thought, well, wait a second, let's find out the common things. Once I know the common things, why don't we teach it to people and see if we can produce the same effects? And so that's so, so, so I realized that they were what the four things were and how they changed. I thought if I worked on those people, it should work on other people. And what about people that are well, what if they started changing and instead of waiting for a disease or diagnosis, could it begin to change their lives in some way if they change, you know, so that kind of started the journey and and nothing happened for a period of time. And then and then it started happening. And the stories of Stories of transformation that are happening right now. It's wonderful to see that other people are having the same experience, and it's becoming kind of a new normal.

[02:19:12.160] - Speaker 7
Yes.

[02:19:12.720] - Speaker 1
Kind of a new way, you know. So that's the exciting part. So for me, um, God, I don't know if the worst thing that happens to you is the best thing that happens to you, I don't know. Yeah. Amazing.

[02:19:24.240] - Speaker 2
Thank you so much for doing this. Such a pleasure talking to you.

[02:19:39.040] - Speaker 
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around.
