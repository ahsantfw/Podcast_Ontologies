[00:00:06.720] - Speaker 3
Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. It was one of my earliest recollections, like three, three and a half.

[00:00:27.190] - Speaker 1
But I had these older cousins that were teenagers they had kiss all over their walls. I remember just looking in there and being so scared and running away, going and being so scared and running away. But then it just stuck with me. Any time I saw Kiss or... Kiss played Solid Gold once. Remember the show Solid Gold? I must have been five years old at this time, but I made my mom wait up because Kiss was going to play. That got me into rock. It just... I didn't have anyone really turn me on to the music, but seeing them.

[00:01:07.570] - Speaker 2
You think it was the image was the thing that got you first as a little kid?

[00:01:10.940] - Speaker 1
Well, it scared the shit out of me, the image. I never heard a song. Maybe a few years later, I heard a song. I started collecting records when I was that age, really young.

[00:01:23.670] - Speaker 2
7 Inches or albums or CDs?

[00:01:25.660] - Speaker 1
Records. There was no CDs at that time. It was still vinyl. Cassettes were fairly new. 8 tracks were still around at that time, but I didn't have that.

[00:01:33.150] - Speaker 2
Mainly vinyl albums.

[00:01:34.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah. The first kiss I ever heard was Paul Stanley's solo kiss.

[00:01:40.170] - Speaker 2
When the four solo albums came out.

[00:01:41.950] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was the first. But once again, I'm five or six years old at this time. I don't even know what's happening. But the first one that I took my mom to the store was a Def Leopard Pyromania, which was huge around the time I was about seven or eight years old.

[00:01:58.510] - Speaker 2
Did you hear them on the radio? Is that how you got into it?

[00:02:00.810] - Speaker 1
It was just every... Yeah, probably radio.

[00:02:02.930] - Speaker 2
What was the radio that you listened to growing up?

[00:02:06.980] - Speaker 1
My mom would put on Kiss FM or something, on my way to school. Pop radio, But I was always attracted to the rock music. Even my closest older cousins were all into dance, disco music, which I grew up with as well, and I love. But I I don't know, something all by myself. It was just this music, and it was something that was... Remember the '80s? It was like a whole Satanic thing. I don't know, for some reason, that even attracted me more.

[00:02:44.240] - Speaker 2
Was it heavy or dark, or did you like that it was guitar-based? What do you think? Aggressive.

[00:02:47.440] - Speaker 1
It was aggressive music.

[00:02:50.320] - Speaker 2
It feels like young boys like aggressive music.

[00:02:53.380] - Speaker 1
But I was a child.

[00:02:54.670] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:02:55.540] - Speaker 1
Maybe teenage. A lot of people get into music when they start turning teenagers, but I was a child, so I can't really explain. When people were like, How did you... Music found me. I didn't really go look for it. My parents are both artists.

[00:03:12.690] - Speaker 2
What type of artists?

[00:03:14.270] - Speaker 1
In Iraq, my mom did sculptures, and she has pictures of her making these tall sculptures much bigger than her. She taught art. My dad has been doing abstract art till this day. Since I was born, I could remember there was- Painting? Painting, yeah. Abstract paintings. That's just always been in the house. Art has always been in the house, but no one pushed it on me. It was just there. It was just something that I was born into, and it was just normal. It was there. It was normal to watch my dad paint. It was normal to watch him experiment. They didn't really listen to too much music.

[00:03:58.670] - Speaker 2
They were more visual Yeah.

[00:04:00.560] - Speaker 1
They never put on a record at the house. It was always me as a kid putting on my records and stuff. But they like music. They listen to music. One of the reasons I think I'm a musician is because when my mother was pregnant, she sang a lot. That's the only reason I could think of, Why have you always been so into music since you were a baby?

[00:04:25.140] - Speaker 2
Did she always sing?

[00:04:26.060] - Speaker 1
No. But when she was pregnant, she sang a lot, and she sang a lot of Arabic, Egyptian singers like Unkhusum. I don't know if you've ever... She's huge. She's like an Aretha Franklin of Arabic music.

[00:04:42.150] - Speaker 2
Let's listen to One. Yeah.

[00:04:51.220] - Speaker 1
She won't sing for a while, which is also cool.

[00:05:48.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah. This was probably composed by a guy named Muhammad Abdul Wahhab. He did a lot of good stuff. I can't... Don't... This one may not be, but I know he did a lot So...

[00:06:33.780] - Speaker 2
Did your mom grow up with this music? Yes.

[00:06:36.530] - Speaker 1
My whole family did. They're from Iraq. So that Egyptian music was big. There was other singers like Abdelhalim, Fadi Tatarash. There's a great guitar player named Omar Khashid. I think I've sent you some of his stuff before. He's like the king of Arabic guitar, Arabic guitar. But his tone was very surf. He was influenced by surf rock. Cool. You hear it in his guitar tone. He's not necessarily playing surf rock, but he might be playing on this track, actually. I always say I would have never written Ariel's if this wasn't part of me. You didn't hear this growing up. If this wasn't part of me.

[00:07:43.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I want to hear the vocals for a little longer.

[00:07:57.660] - Speaker 1
I told you, it's It's them playing for a very long time. Then sometimes the audience, if this is live, the audience will clap and ask her to not sing and ask them to do this all over again.

[00:09:10.410] - Speaker 1
I don't know what she's saying. I don't speak Arabic. It's all about lost love and crushed because of these things. I don't know what she's singing now, but my parents always say that's the theme of-The heartbreak? Heartbreak, but it's deep, though. It's not corny.

[00:09:33.630] - Speaker 2
It doesn't sound corny.

[00:09:35.600] - Speaker 1
Because they cry when they hear it. There's something going on here.

[00:09:39.230] - Speaker 2
How old were your parents when they moved to the United States?

[00:09:43.850] - Speaker 1
In their mid to late '20s.

[00:09:46.680] - Speaker 2
Around what year was that?

[00:09:47.970] - Speaker 1
'74, '75. I was born in '75, so they were here '74. They came straight to Hollywood from Baghdad. That's Why did they decide to move to the US? Saddam. Things were changing in Iraq. They felt like if they were going to do art, it was probably going to have to be for propaganda. Just things were changing. One of my uncles got detained once. It really put a scare in him. He thought he was going to die. Things were changing a lot in Iraq at that time. So some of my families had the guts to leave because half of my family stayed there. But I thank God every day, man. If they stayed there, I would have ended up becoming a soldier. I don't know if I would have been old enough for Iran, Iraq, but I would have definitely been old enough for the two US. I have cousins and uncles that were all soldiers at that time.

[00:10:50.660] - Speaker 2
Probably didn't have a choice there. It was mandatory.

[00:10:52.960] - Speaker 1
No, you got to go. It was mandatory. Yeah, you got to go. I remember that all hit me once. I was on a tour bus in Baltimore. We were driving and outside was Baltimore. It was really early in the morning. I was still up all night. I never thought of it before, but I was like, wow, man, if my parents never moved, here I am on this tour bus with this band The alternative, it would have been me as a soldier. I cannot picture myself as a soldier, but you'd have to do it. I never thought of that, but I always I remember that bus ride, and that's where that hit me. I'm so thankful to my parents for… It wasn't easy. They came here with nothing. We lived in a one-bedroom apartment off Santa Monica in Vine. Pretty shady.

[00:11:45.690] - Speaker 2
Did they ever talk about life in Iraq before?

[00:11:50.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was good.

[00:11:52.120] - Speaker 2
Life was good up until Saddam, and then it changed, and then they escaped, basically.

[00:11:59.030] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah, they escaped. My uncles that stayed there, the government would always ask them, Where are your brothers? Where are your sisters? Where did they go? Do they talk to you? Did they send you letters? Those people that stayed there had a a tough time. Once again, they served in the military. They had bombs fall on them numerous times. They're all here now. Luckily, I made something of the music thing, and I was able to bring them here. So that was a big deal for me because, Isis and all that stuff was happening.

[00:12:35.070] - Speaker 2
Can you play me a little bit of Ariel's and tell me the connection to that Egyptian music?

[00:12:43.230] - Speaker 1
I'd have to tune it the right way. I don't know, just the vibe of it. Just like the… It moves in the... They're not quarter notes, but it moves in that type of way. I guess that's how I interpret what I'm hearing in some way.

[00:13:27.210] - Speaker 2
It shares the emotion of the music.

[00:13:30.820] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It wasn't done because I wanted to play that. No. It's just how shit comes out of me when people say, There's this Arabic or Romanian influence, I rarely ever try to do that.

[00:13:46.520] - Speaker 2
Not intentional.

[00:13:47.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's not intentional. It just comes out of me that way. I think that music, Eastern music, Middle Eastern music, is to me what I guess blues would be to someone with family that's from the West. Because that's just those scales and that vibe is more natural.

[00:14:10.390] - Speaker 2
It's your folk music. Growing up, where would you hear folk music? I mean, I know about Romanian folk music.

[00:14:17.510] - Speaker 1
I don't know about Romanian folk music, but going to a wedding, you'd hear a lot of like, Romanian dance music and pop music. It was around. It was around because I was in the Romanian community. My family, my friends were on. But for me, at that time, it wasn't necessarily what I would put on because I was just into rock and whatever, popular music or heavy metal music.

[00:14:43.200] - Speaker 2
When did you first start playing guitar?

[00:14:46.110] - Speaker 1
When I was 12. I'm not in love with the guitar. I never have been. When I said I grew up in a one bedroom apartment, I always wanted drums. I was more in the singers. I was more into the drumbers. The guitar came by accident because you can turn off an amplifier. When we lived in that apartment, I was like, drums. When we move one day and I get my own room, because me and my parents slept in that same room for 11 years. So I never had my own room until I was 12 years old. So we moved to Glendale, and I had my own room. All right, 12th birthday, going to the music store, going to get my drum set. Always wanted it. That's always what I dreamt of doing. My parents had a talk amongst each other and said, You can't really turn off the drums. They got me an amp about this big. It was a gorilla amp, if you remember those. Yeah. A guitar was an Arbor. I don't even think that company is around anymore. I still wanted drums after that. But I don't know. The guitar was there, the amp was there, it was in my room, and I just started fiddling with it, and I started spending more time with it.

[00:16:06.260] - Speaker 1
And the next thing, I'm a guitar player, never got the drums. So I'm happy it worked out that way, but I've just never been the guy. There are some guys that are just in love with the guitar, and that's their thing. That's what they do. For me, it's a tool to write songs. I never wanted to be some technical guitar virtuoso or anything, but I was really into composing and writing my own stuff. I had these friends in high school. I never really hung out with too many musicians. My friends were all... We were like trouble. We were like the guys who would be fighting at school. We weren't a gang, but it was somewhat gang-like, you could say, because we fought a lot. But it was these kinds of guys. They weren't metal guys. They weren't artsy guys. They weren't... I I would write these songs that were ballady, folky English songs I don't really write in Romanian. I would be the guy that took his acoustic to the party. I'd play a little cover here and there, but I would also play my own stuff. When I would play my own stuff, I realized it would really touch one of my friends, and you'd see the guy walk out and he'd be crying.

[00:17:26.520] - Speaker 2
Even then?

[00:17:27.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I was maybe 14, 15 years old. That's when I realized something where it was like I had this thing that I can touch people with these songs.

[00:17:41.940] - Speaker 2
At that time, would it have been guitar and vocals?

[00:17:45.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's always guitar vocals for me. When I write, I always write guitar and vocals. I always tell people, I don't write riffs. A lot of guys write riffs. You write songs. I want that rift to turn into a song. If it's just a rift, I'm not impressed. I could write plenty of riffs. I'm more impressed with myself and happy when I've written a song, full song, verse, chorus. I know how it's going to move. If I don't have the lyrics I know how the vocals are going to move and the melody is going to go. When I present a song to the band, or whether it's system or when I do scars, it's always me with a guitar like this and just showing the band the song, the whole song, not just like, I got this part.

[00:18:39.040] - Speaker 2
It's always been that way. Yeah. That you pretty much write a song top to bottom and think of it as a composition, not a series of parts.

[00:18:48.650] - Speaker 1
I wouldn't bring it in if it wasn't… I usually feel like, Okay, the song is ready to show when I have that. I've never really been like, Oh, I got this one rift, but I don't know where it's going. There's times where I'll have a composition and I'll say, I have an idea of how the vocal should move, but I'm not 100% sure. But I'm usually pretty certain of how the tempo and the music and how I want this part to be moving, how I want that part to be moving. It's all going on in my head while I'm writing it.

[00:19:25.340] - Speaker 2
The cords and the melodies come at the same time?

[00:19:31.670] - Speaker 1
Sometimes. Typically. There's no right way or wrong way. What happens is I'll be sitting and playing the guitar and I'll come up with something. Maybe I'll come up with a rift, maybe the rift and something else. I just record it and I leave it. Then the next time I play, I always go through my ideas, and I play with them almost like a toy. Sometimes a song will come out right away, but sometimes it takes a long time for me to piece together a song.

[00:20:09.080] - Speaker 2
Give me an example in terms of it happening quickly. How long would it be quickly and how long would it be if it took a long Like a song like BYOB probably took a long time.

[00:20:20.580] - Speaker 1
I wrote the middle part first.

[00:20:23.350] - Speaker 2
What's the middle part?

[00:20:26.530] - Speaker 1
Blast up, blast up. It's party time. We don't live in a fascist nation. That by itself was like this, Why don't presidents fight the war? Why they always send for? Why don't presidents fight the war? That was just... It was like this punk song, punk funky type of song that I wrote. But then time passed and I wrote... And I had also That was totally because I was listening to Funkadelik at the time.

[00:21:05.150] - Speaker 2
Wow, that's cool.

[00:21:05.800] - Speaker 1
It's not like I'm trying to mix this, but it just one night I was playing, and that's what I'm saying. Maybe I don't have that part yet, maybe. When I pick up the guitar for that week, I'm just playing my… And then just seeing what it leads into. But I don't force it. At some point, it led into that. I can't tell you exactly when, but it led into… It wasn't on purpose. It wasn't because, Oh, I'm listening to Funkaduck and I want to do a funk adult. It just came out that way. I feel like you have to have the patience to let that happen.

[00:21:55.170] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it takes as long as it takes.

[00:21:56.890] - Speaker 1
Some people… Look, everyone's got their way, but I don't write my songs in front of a computer. I don't record them right away. I play them. I have a list of songs that nobody's ever heard. Every time I pick up the guitar, I play through all of them. Each one of them, some of them might be more finished than the others, but each one of them has this part that I'm like, That can be better. That can be better. But I play with it like you play with a toy. You shape it, you try, doesn't work until something comes along and you feel confident. That's how the long process is and where you need patience.

[00:22:39.780] - Speaker 2
Did you say you play every day?

[00:22:41.230] - Speaker 1
No.

[00:22:42.010] - Speaker 2
How often do you play?

[00:22:43.070] - Speaker 1
When I want.

[00:22:44.140] - Speaker 2
How often do you want to?

[00:22:45.850] - Speaker 1
Sometimes a month will go by that I don't play, and sometimes I play for that whole week. When I was growing up, I played every day.

[00:22:54.860] - Speaker 2
How many hours a day would you play?

[00:22:57.840] - Speaker 1
Back in those days? Yeah. The whole day, it would pass by like 6, 7, 8. I don't know, man.

[00:23:04.430] - Speaker 2
Would you consider it practicing or it was something else?

[00:23:07.040] - Speaker 1
No, I never practice.

[00:23:08.890] - Speaker 2
I just play. Would you play two other things or no? You play along with records? No. No. Just play by yourself looking for songs?

[00:23:18.840] - Speaker 1
Just enjoying my shit that I've written. Somewhere down the line, it gets better. The last thing that comes to my mind whenever I write something is, I can't wait for everyone to hear this.

[00:23:33.440] - Speaker 2
You're doing it for yourself in that moment.

[00:23:36.380] - Speaker 1
Just like my dad. My dad paints paintings. He doesn't do exhibits or anything. He does it because he does it. He doesn't know any other way to live. That's what he does. He doesn't even sign them. It's for me, releasing it is weird because I never really listen to those songs again. I rarely put on Toxicity. I rarely put on System Records, Scars, anything I made once I put it out, it's almost like, bye-bye.

[00:24:08.420] - Speaker 2
But even the song from childhood, if you haven't released it, you might still play it.

[00:24:14.440] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:24:15.050] - Speaker 2
Because it's still yours. Once you put it out, it's not really- And I enjoy it. It becomes everybody's.

[00:24:21.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and I enjoy it. I don't know any other way to be. I would be doing this if I was not the guy from system of a I would still be doing this. It's for me. It's not even an approach. It's just the way it is. That's the way I know. That's the way I've watched my dad. That's the way I've seen art. You do it because you enjoy it. You love it. It's an itch, and you want to impress yourself.

[00:24:52.180] - Speaker 2
How is it different playing by yourself versus playing with a band?

[00:25:00.540] - Speaker 1
With a band, you're rehearsing to play a song, playing by myself is more intimate. I don't really play in front of people anymore.

[00:25:09.550] - Speaker 2
By yourself?

[00:25:10.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Remember I said I used to take my guitar. For some The reason once the band got big, something changed in me. Every time I picked up a guitar in front of people, it became this big deal or something to them.

[00:25:26.980] - Speaker 2
You think people had expectations or something?

[00:25:30.930] - Speaker 1
I don't know, but I don't... I wait for my girl to go to bed. She doesn't rarely ever sees me play the guitar. It's always when I'm alone. Yeah.

[00:25:45.920] - Speaker 2
You can entertain yourself alone for a long time doing it. Yeah.

[00:25:50.380] - Speaker 1
Hours and hours. Yeah, and not just guitar, man. Like I said, it's not like I'm not in love with this. I'm in love with making sounds, synthesizers, Making stuff. Anything that feels right to me at that moment, that I have a craving, and my cravings change. Sometimes my craving is the guitar. Sometimes I only want to play in clean. Sometimes I don't want to plug it in. I just want to play it like that. Things change when you don't plug it in and write something as opposed to put some distortion on that and write something.

[00:26:24.850] - Speaker 2
You think it has something to do with what you're hearing or how it feels on your fingers?

[00:26:30.550] - Speaker 1
I think how it feels and hearing, sure. I mean, you're hearing it, but you put an effect on it makes you play a different something. Well, not putting anything is an effect all its own as well.

[00:26:46.140] - Speaker 2
Most of your songs are straightforward guitar plugged into the amp.

[00:26:49.460] - Speaker 1
Not too much.

[00:26:50.830] - Speaker 2
Not a lot of tricks.

[00:26:52.380] - Speaker 1
But I don't count out that maybe I may do some tricks somewhere.

[00:26:56.380] - Speaker 2
You're not against it, but just most of your songs are. It hasn't happened that way. It's going to happen that way. Was system your first band or were you in a band before?

[00:27:08.120] - Speaker 1
The first band situation I ever played for was with these three guys, and we used to play Metallica covers in their dad's little garage. I was probably about 13 years old around that time.

[00:27:19.980] - Speaker 2
Did you ever jam with other people or was more playing songs with other people?

[00:27:24.180] - Speaker 1
At that time, it was more playing songs with other people. Towards the end of high school, I met this guy at a party, and he was with someone that I had gone to elementary school with who I hadn't seen for a long time. They were looking for a singer, and I was like, Okay, I can sing. I'm a singer. They had a lead guitar player guy, but I said, for me, the guitar and the vocals, it comes together. I'm like, A combo deal there. I went and tried out for their band, and they were into what I was doing. We played Paranoid by Black Sabbath. It just hit. Shabel was there. Shabel is also someone I remembered from that Romanian elementary school that I went to that I had left a while a while ago, but he's a year older than I am, so he was in the class, but I remember Shavel from there. There was a few people that came to those rehearsals that were from that elementary school. Shavel was there, and Shabbat was just there as a friend not really playing anything. He heard us and he told the guys in the band that were his friends.

[00:28:38.810] - Speaker 1
He said, he's like, just get rid of the guitar player and bring this guy in. He's doing the guitar and he's singing, and you guys sound more alive. Then I started bringing songs into that band. They were more like rock. This is like, we're talking early '90s, late '80s. The glam scene was still…

[00:29:01.210] - Speaker 2
Like hair metal was still happening?

[00:29:03.100] - Speaker 1
It was more towards that direction music, but a little heavier than hair metal. We didn't really have the hair. But the style of the music was that, more rock. It wasn't very metal, it was more rock. And so yeah, Shavel told them, Keep this guy and get rid of the other guy. That's what ended up happening. That band shared a rehearsal studio with a band that Serge played with, but Serge didn't sing. Serge just played the keyboards at that time. He had never sang before. So I was the singer. At some point, that band wanted to get rid of their singer and ask me to Like, Serge's band asked me to be their singer. But I was like, they sang in Romanian. I could do it, but I just wasn't something that I felt. I felt a little bit out of my skin singing in Armenia. I always sang in English. I never became their singer, but I started jamming with them.

[00:30:05.320] - Speaker 2
The kids in that band, were they born in the United States or were they born somewhere else? Do you know?

[00:30:11.490] - Speaker 1
Probably born in Lebanon.

[00:30:13.330] - Speaker 2
Born in Lebanon, which is so Maybe- Serge was born in Lebanon. You grew up here, were born here, so English was your first language. You know some Romanian.

[00:30:22.820] - Speaker 1
No, I went to Armenia school. I speak Romanian. I can sing Romanian. It's just not something I wanted to do at that time. I don't know. It just didn't flow out of me the same way English still.

[00:30:37.720] - Speaker 2
Did many of the kids have the same story of parents coming to the US, similar situation?

[00:30:44.780] - Speaker 1
Well, it depends what country they're coming from.

[00:30:47.490] - Speaker 2
Tell me some of the examples because I don't know anything about the community.

[00:30:50.640] - Speaker 1
Well, it was war. The Lebanese Armeanians came here because there was war at that time in their country. Persian Armen came here because Yaya Tola took over at some point, '79. Iraq, Armenia, Saddam. Everyone was coming here for a better life. Things were changing in the countries that they grew up in, which takes balls, man. Yeah, for sure. If shit was changing here, I don't know if I'd get up and leave and go to fucking Iraq.

[00:31:23.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah. No, it's radical.

[00:31:25.080] - Speaker 1
I went to Iraq. When I was 14 years old, my mom took me to Iraq. What was that like? When I was 14, I was full on speed metal, metal kid. But I had a Motley Crue T-shirt on the whole time. I was walking around Iraq with a Motley Crue T-shirt, and it had this check's ass. Our luggage was lost. That's all I had. I wear this Motley Crue T-shirt, and I think it was like Nikki 6 on a motorcycle or something. It was this check with her ass sticking out. It was a culture shock. I was there for two months.

[00:32:06.690] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:32:07.560] - Speaker 1
I saw my family. I mean, people I only saw in pictures. My grandmother, my aunts, my cousins. It was nice to see them. But this was at the height of Saddam. So everywhere you turned was Saddam. If we were in this room, you better have that picture of him up there because they'll question you if you don't. So business, everyone's house. You walk outside, there's a statue. You look at where there's a picture. You look over there, the building. There's no Marlborough ad. It's a Saddam ad. Two channels on the television, one of them, Saddam, All day. One of them, Sadam half the day. Wow. I'm from Hollywood and not used to this life. I had all my cassettes with me with my Walkman, and I took a bunch of metal magazines, and I read through every single. I was bored. But Slayer, Show No Mercy. When I think of Iraq, I think of Slayer, Show No Mercy. Because that was the album that I had on in my head a lot. It was just two months of... It was very educational. I learned a lot about how the world is different than where I come from.

[00:33:34.280] - Speaker 1
If you say anything bad about Saddam, I would be this little punk kid, and I'm like, What if we told Saddam to fuck off? They'd go, Shit. Don't fucking say it. They'll take you away. Yeah, don't say that shit, man. You're crazy.

[00:33:47.650] - Speaker 2
The people live in fear.

[00:33:49.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the people live in fear. You don't fuck around. You don't say that thing. You put the picture up. Yeah. I think I might be the first person that might have taken that music to Iraq in 1989. When I put on for my cousins, Slayer, Matal.

[00:34:14.000] - Speaker 2
They never heard anything like that before.

[00:34:15.800] - Speaker 1
What the hell is this? It's like, this is music?

[00:34:19.680] - Speaker 2
The music they were hearing was more like what your parents grew up on.

[00:34:23.020] - Speaker 1
Yes, or a pop version of that as time went on. Yeah.

[00:34:30.640] - Speaker 2
Then were you happy to come back to Hollywood?

[00:34:34.760] - Speaker 1
We were living in Glendale at that time, but I was a kid that grew up in Hollywood. We only had been living in Glendale for two years at that point. I was happy, but during the first Iraq war, the desert storm, that's when I learned the media lies to you. I was only about 15 years old at that time.

[00:35:03.160] - Speaker 2
What were the lies?

[00:35:05.300] - Speaker 1
Well, just dehumanizing the people in Iraq so the people here would be more open to us throwing bombs over their heads. Both times are very tough for my family because it's my grandmother that's there. It's my aunt that's there.

[00:35:21.450] - Speaker 2
You know that they're good people like you.

[00:35:24.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I know the other people in Iraq were very nice people as well.

[00:35:28.930] - Speaker 2
Maybe they didn't like Saddam, but it had nothing to do with the people.

[00:35:32.430] - Speaker 1
No. Half the people hated Saddam. More than half the people hated Saddam. They just couldn't come out and say that they hated Saddam. But my family didn't like Saddam. On the most part, I still have some ants that like...

[00:35:48.020] - Speaker 2
The ones who liked them, what did they like?

[00:35:51.210] - Speaker 1
Well, in their head was like, just don't start trouble and trouble won't come to you. That's the deal.

[00:35:58.240] - Speaker 2
It's like if you mind your own business, everything It's fine.

[00:36:00.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah, don't try to overthrow the government. Don't try to conspire to do things. Just live your life and you'll be fine.

[00:36:08.700] - Speaker 2
It was only if you went against the government that you'd be in trouble.

[00:36:16.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but his sons were fucking assholes, too. They would pick on people. You would say... I mean, there was a movie about it. The guy would go to a wedding and take the bride and fuck the bride. His sons were probably bigger sons of a bitch as than he was. Torture. If they assume, maybe you didn't do anything, and they just assumed, and your next thing you know, you're being fucking tortured, and you're in a room with cigarettes going out and your fucking eyeballs or some shit. I don't fucking I couldn't tell you the details as well as my family members can, who lived there. I was only there for two months.

[00:36:54.540] - Speaker 2
They were all happy to get out?

[00:36:57.540] - Speaker 1
Some of them wish things just didn't change because Because it was their home.

[00:37:01.800] - Speaker 2
Understood. They missed their home, but their home changed.

[00:37:06.430] - Speaker 1
They had no choice. They had no choice. Because once again, you had ISIS that stuff. I got them out of there before all that shit started happening. They're Christians. So not the safest place to be a Christian when ISIS is running around town, chopping heads off. They just assume that you might be doing something against them, and you're screwed. Like I said, they detained my uncle back in the day because he accidentally bumped into some guy's bike, and that guy happened to be some huge official. It was a total accident. They take him to this room, and they made him feel like they were going to kill him. In his head, he was like, Fuck this. I got to find a way out of here. Yeah.

[00:37:52.620] - Speaker 2
Now we were up to, you get asked to sing for the band that Serge was in.

[00:38:00.680] - Speaker 1
I don't do that, but I ended up jamming with them a lot. I'd rehearse with my band, and then if they came in, I would stick around and I would play guitar with them.

[00:38:12.870] - Speaker 2
Were you friends with all of them?

[00:38:14.890] - Speaker 1
I got to know them through this situation. I wasn't really friends with anybody, to be honest with you.

[00:38:21.460] - Speaker 2
It was just- People to play music with.

[00:38:24.090] - Speaker 1
The guys we shared our studio with, and that's how I got to know them. It's not like I knew them for years. They're older than I was. Serge is eight years older than I am. But that's how Serge and I became friends through them.

[00:38:37.200] - Speaker 2
Were they serious about that band?

[00:38:38.900] - Speaker 1
Did they think-Not so sure. It was like a weekend, but guys that had other things going on, but they played like... They had equipment and they enjoyed playing and jamming. But I'm not sure they were trying to take it anywhere. I mean, through my life, I was Anyone who knew me when I was a kid would tell you he always said that this is what he wanted to do. If you met me at eight years old, if you met me at 12 years old, anyone who knew me through my life knew As I was getting older, they even called me to the school counselor once, and I'm a high school dropout, and I got kicked out of my high school twice. They sent me to a continuation school. I don't know if you know what that is. It's where all the pregnant girls go. So pregnant girls, gangsters, the kids that were more trouble-I see. Would go there because it ain't working out for you. You ditch all day or you get into too many fights. You know what I mean? They send you away to this school. It was like a bunch of bungalows for lunch.

[00:39:55.590] - Speaker 1
A lunch truck would show up. It was totally different. But anyway, they sent me to the counselor, and they're like, Are you failing all your classes? You hardly show up to school. You show up, you ditch. You probably go to one or two classes. What do you want to do? What do you want to do with your life? And I go, I'm a musician. They're like, You're a musician.

[00:40:15.690] - Speaker 2
Even then you knew it. You thought of yourself as that.

[00:40:19.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I said, I'm going to... So they're like, What's your plan? I go, I'm going to start a band. I'm going to play on Sunset Strip. That's what I told my counselors. They even had a school psychiatrist there and everything. Is everything good at home? And I'm like, Everything's fine. But it was just something that in my head, I had convinced myself that this is going to happen. I don't know, man. I was very confident Yeah. They're like, All right, off to CT, you go then. They sent me to CT. Through my late teenage years, I was always looking for the band. This is the band that I feel like I can make it in. I might have been in a band, but I was like, I don't think this band is going to make it.

[00:41:07.590] - Speaker 2
When you say make it, the aspiration was to play on the Sunset Strip.

[00:41:11.910] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and become popular on the That's the sunset strip, I guess.

[00:41:16.430] - Speaker 2
But you didn't think about playing... Last time I saw you play, 60,000 people came to see you play songs that you've recorded more than 15 years ago. But that was never the goal. The goal was a club band.

[00:41:31.560] - Speaker 1
Well, at that point, the goal was to just start a band that you feel confident with and you're going to go play the clubs. That's all I knew. I didn't know the business. I was just a kid. I didn't really know what you had to do.

[00:41:46.040] - Speaker 2
How old were you at that time?

[00:41:48.460] - Speaker 1
Sixteen.

[00:41:48.760] - Speaker 2
Tell me about looking for the band.

[00:41:54.140] - Speaker 1
Well, it's just we would... Anyone who I told that to would say to me, Really? How many Armenians do you know that made it? That's from my Romanian friend.

[00:42:07.490] - Speaker 2
People would not be supportive. Or not be supportive, but- I had a lot of support, but obviously, it's- People didn't believe it was possible.

[00:42:15.970] - Speaker 1
It's a pretty far-fetched thing. Yeah, not realistic. How many bands actually do get there?

[00:42:21.880] - Speaker 2
It's very rare. Very rare. Very few.

[00:42:24.520] - Speaker 1
You might probably be better off buying a lottery ticket or something. You know what I mean? It's really rare. But I had confidence. Then one day, my guitar got stolen, so I was looking for another guitar, and I went to a guitar store, and Tracy Guns, the guitar player from LA Gunz, walks into the guitar store, and I'm jamming, I'm playing. He's like, You're going to buy that guitar? He goes, I got that guitar. Come to my house and we'll see what… Maybe I'll give it for a good deal or something like that. At this time, this guy was on MTV. You know what I mean? La Guns was doing okay. Me and my cousin, she drove me to the guitar store. He was originally in Guns & Roses.

[00:43:13.600] - Speaker 2
That's why they were called Guns & Because of Tracy Guns and Axel Rose. I know. But now he's in LA Guns.

[00:43:20.850] - Speaker 1
We went to his place and my cousin asks him, she goes, My little cousin here, he's always talking about he wants to do something in music. He wants to make it in music. She goes, Aren't there a zillion bands in LA? At this time, it was like, it was, it was that. He said, Yeah, there are, but there's only a couple of good ones. For me, I was like, All right.

[00:43:52.480] - Speaker 2
I want to be one of those good ones.

[00:43:54.120] - Speaker 1
No, I was like, I am one of those already.

[00:43:57.010] - Speaker 2
Wow, that's great.

[00:43:58.910] - Speaker 1
I was like, I'm almost there then. You know what I mean? In my head, I was that cocky. That's great. It's funny because I don't really have that in me anymore the same way. But that kid was really… Anyway, so okay, cool. That was that experience. It gave me… It was like, so it does matter if you're good or bad, too. Yeah, some guys make it because they have connections, but if you're actually good, there's a chance. There's a chance. So just be good. Put something together that's good. Then life happens. That band I was in that was sharing the rehearsal for one reason or the other didn't work out. Serge and I became closer friends and started hanging out. And somewhere down the line, I didn't want to be... I really look up to people like Pete Townsend. I really look up to the guys that are like those guys in their band. I think Jerry Cantrell is one of them. They sing, but they're more of the writer or the guy who's producing what's happening, the guy who's setting the table. And Serge at the same time wanted to become a singer, but he had never really fronted a band.

[00:45:18.070] - Speaker 1
Remember, they asked me to sing. It was this transition that happened where I pulled my singing back. Still sang, but pulled it back. He was trying to find himself at this time. Let's just say early Serge. Anyway, this happened, and me and him meet. We stick with the bass player from my other band, but we meet this guy who was this Hawaiian drummer, who was some tall guy that played like a beast. His name was Domingo. That's when we became Soil, which was the band before System.

[00:46:00.420] - Speaker 2
It's you, Serge Domingo, and the bass player from your previous band. Yeah. Were any of the soil songs later System songs?

[00:46:09.120] - Speaker 1
Parts of them.

[00:46:10.220] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:46:10.840] - Speaker 1
Like the End of Sugar, I sit in my desolate room. The song Soil. That was a soil song. Tentative, which was came on mesmerized, hypnotized. That rift was from the soil days. The song wasn't the same, but that rift, I wrote Tentative with that rift in there. So once again, this was very early on in Serge's vocal as a vocalist. He was doing some stuff that was cool, but then he was doing some stuff that I don't think we were getting yet. I wasn't, and Domingo wasn't. So Domingo No, really wasn't. He was like, What's he? He does this crazy stuff and this craky stuff. I was 18, 19 years old at this time. This guy was much older than I was. He was more leader than I was in the situation. And so behind Serge's back, we would try out other guys. We would tell Well, Serge, we're not rehearsing today, and someone else would come in and try out. Mostly because he really wanted somebody else.

[00:47:41.090] - Speaker 2
Domingo wanted somebody else.

[00:47:42.250] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I understood because Serge had not developed yet.

[00:47:48.730] - Speaker 2
He was still green as a singer.

[00:47:50.420] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:47:51.150] - Speaker 2
He was really a keyboard player. Yeah. Had you ever sing together yet?

[00:48:00.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, on this track that we did called Waco Jesus. It was about David Koresh. We sang together on that track, but that never became a soil song. Soil was like the songs were not really songs. The way I always see it as system of a down is the song version of the soil sound. I see. The sound of system of a down was there.

[00:48:27.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:48:27.800] - Speaker 1
Not fully, but there. Yeah.

[00:48:31.790] - Speaker 2
How long was soil? How many years?

[00:48:33.910] - Speaker 1
Not even years. Maybe a year. One year. Maybe a year. We played one gig. Okay.

[00:48:39.530] - Speaker 2
Only one gig was soil?

[00:48:40.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was at this little café. The stage was so small that the first rift, I fell off and I fell on a drum set of the other band. It was like this stage was this tiny thing, and I was like, wow. I was so hungry to be on stage. I just couldn't keep myself from just losing it, and I just accidentally fell off the stage onto a drum set. But that was our only gig. Shava was there, and we were having a little pit. So Shaava would come into the soil rehearsals as a friend. As a guy that, I really like what you guys are doing, man. He was just-Fan. Yeah. I wouldn't call him a fan. He was a friend, but he liked. He dug the band and he was just supportive. He played some guitar. He wasn't He wasn't really a bass player at the time. He was just playing guitar. Not really as long as I had been playing, but maybe for a couple of years, and he was getting better. Through that time, I started becoming friends with Shabbat and Shavo and I started hanging out more. Anyway, we played that one gig.

[00:49:51.060] - Speaker 1
Domingo was from Hawaii. He decided, I guess he had a kid or something, and he moved back to Hawaii. Soil was gone. At this point, I was like, Okay, Shavo and I have been really good friends, and we've been talking a lot, and we have a lot in common with the heavier stuff. We both like Sepul We both like Pantera. We both like these heavier band, death metal bands. I decided to bring Shabbat in, and I didn't really discuss it with anybody, but we brought Shabbat in It wasn't really a band yet because the drummer left. Yeah. After trying so many singers, I was like, none of these guys are better than Serge. I started appreciating some of the things that maybe I didn't appreciate early on. Serge was still there. Schavo came into the picture, and that was the beginning of System of a Down. We had the band name before we even had the... I would sit in the car with Shavo, and we would just listen to music and talk about it. It'd be cool to start a band that's like this, like metal. We talk a lot. He even mentioned one time he's like, And yeah, one day we'll get Rick Rubin to produce our album.

[00:51:27.510] - Speaker 1
It's fucking crazy. It's It's crazy because he…

[00:51:32.530] - Speaker 2
It's not even a band yet.

[00:51:34.300] - Speaker 1
We didn't have a drummer.

[00:51:37.700] - Speaker 2
It's amazing.

[00:51:38.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I was going to Valley College at the time. Not really. I was just going there to show my mom like, Oh, look, I'm doing something response, but I would ditch that too. But I reconnected with Andy, which was the drummer that was with the band before Soil that I was in. We reconnected and I was like, it didn't work out last time with him. There was some personality things going on. But I was like, maybe things have changed. We really need a drummer. He's good. I brought Andy in, and we're like, Let's jam with Andy, guys. Everyone knew Andy, but we were a little hesitant because we had our issues in the past. I I'd known Andy since the third grade. I went to elementary school with him. But once Andy came in, that's it. We just started playing. I brought in a song. I remember the first song I brought in was a song called Flake. We never played it, never recorded it. It was okay. But I had brought in the vocals and the arrangement, and we played, and the band started developing. I would bring in more songs, and then I would start writing with Serge's vocals in mind.

[00:53:09.230] - Speaker 1
We all hung out at the studio together. We all listened to music together. We all got stoned together. There's something about that that's part of the band's development when you're all listening to the same type of stuff. Once again, Serge doesn't come from the rock influence world or metal even. His brother I had a big CD collection. I would listen to that stuff, but Serge not so much. I would always be trying to turn Serge on to listen to this guy, listen to this, listen to that, and just try to open his ears to styles. Believe it or not, the doors were a big influence.

[00:53:50.750] - Speaker 2
I love the doors. I wouldn't make the connection, but that's really cool.

[00:53:54.140] - Speaker 1
Well, the spoken word stuff. A song like War, We Will Fight the Heathens, We Will Fight the Heathens. I had the verse in the course, but for a bridge, a lot of guys would go into a guitar solo, and for me, I was like, What if we just… He talks over it. I would write these parts, so it would give him space to have those spoken word moments. Then he would say, I wouldn't tell him what to say. I wouldn't say what to do. Systems started developing and We started playing in clubs. We played in clubs for a while with Andy. Then the band was starting to get popular in the club scene. I knew that was it. I knew this was the band. This was the band. I felt it. This is the band that I was looking for this whole time.

[00:54:53.800] - Speaker 2
Did you know how far out your songs were?

[00:54:59.320] - Speaker 1
I never saw It just can't...

[00:55:01.260] - Speaker 2
Because they just come to you naturally.

[00:55:04.830] - Speaker 1
I think there's something abstract about system of a down. Yes.

[00:55:09.530] - Speaker 2
Metal music tends not to be an abstract form. Bringing that abstraction and Middle Eastern roots to metal changes everything. It really was. It was like nothing I ever heard before.

[00:55:29.410] - Speaker 1
I I think we were trying to do something that wasn't copying other people, but I'm not sure how much of it was so intentional.

[00:55:40.780] - Speaker 2
Because it came natural to you. It's how you heard the music.

[00:55:44.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and the way he sang was the way he sang.

[00:55:48.060] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.

[00:55:49.050] - Speaker 1
It just made for a good combination. I wrote a lot of vocals myself. The vocal style A Lile of System of a Down is a mix between me and Serge. Then somewhere down the line, things were not working out with Andy. This was close to when we were starting to get some interest from labels and stuff like this. We felt like if we want to take this far, it's probably not going to happen with him in the band. It was really tough because he was a very talented guy. I'll never take that away from him. He is. He's still alive. He is a really talented drummer, keyboard player, and he ended up becoming the singer of a band called The Apex Theory.

[00:56:39.430] - Speaker 2
Cool.

[00:56:41.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It wasn't his talent, let's just say. John was someone that was a guy that we shared a rehearsal studio with. Was he in another band? He was in another band that System and that band shared a studio with. Our drumet, his drumet were like face to face, and And Shava and I were at our pot dealer's house, and Shava goes to me, Hey, guess what? Andy broke his arm. He punched a wall and he broke all the bones in his arm. And I looked at Shava, and I was like, Call John.

[00:57:17.660] - Speaker 2
Had you ever played with John before?

[00:57:19.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah, just jamming. I knew he was a good drummer. I know he could handle it. He was a different drummer than Andy. Not as loose as Andy, but more solid, dependable, strong. When I think of John's drumming, it's solid, it's strong, it doesn't wave.

[00:57:39.300] - Speaker 2
No. He's super solid. Super solid and groovy, too.

[00:57:45.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Apparently, John was like, before you guys called me, he goes, Every single one of you had had a conversation with me saying that this might happen because things were…

[00:57:57.360] - Speaker 2
The writing was on the wall that Andy was not going to make Yeah, it was just looking that way.

[00:58:03.070] - Speaker 1
First rehearsal, John knew a lot of our songs already because he had been there for our rehearsals listening to them. He'd probably been there in some times when we were writing them, just hanging out, because the studio for us was a place where both-Was the hangout. For both bands, for all the guys. He caught on to it right away. That was towards the end of the Sunset Strip transitioning into getting signed.

[00:58:32.090] - Speaker 2
The first album is called System of a Down, 1998. Which song would be representative of this era of system?

[00:58:43.700] - Speaker 1
Sweopy, Sugar, War, Pluck, more the heavy stuff. I think the goal at that time was play the clubs and start a pit. You know what I mean? Be heavy, be unique, but be heavy. Yeah.

[00:59:00.290] - Speaker 2
To get the energy, to get the response from the audience?

[00:59:03.410] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:59:05.760] - Speaker 2
Let's see. Let's hear Sweet Bee.

[00:59:31.000] - Speaker 3
Papa did not talk about the experience. The other day, her name was Jesus. I've never heard everyone cry, everyone cry, everyone cried. Cry philosophy, cry a philosophy, cry a philosophy, cry. You die for a philosophy, die for a philosophy, die a philosophy, die. Cross and terror ravages of architecture, let me die, blaze. We're cross and terror ravages of architecture, rest her in the space. See, for me, that just came naturally.

[01:00:16.100] - Speaker 1
When that part, it was just like, it should go into this. I don't know. I can't tell you why. You're in your little trance, and it just goes that way.

[01:00:33.350] - Speaker 2
And I can see a doors-like moment.

[01:00:39.560] - Speaker 1
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:00:41.290] - Speaker 2
It's not... It didn't sound like the doors, but I understand the connection in that change and the dynamics of the vocals also be something you might hear in the door.

[01:01:00.390] - Speaker 3
Really funny to me.

[01:01:06.860] - Speaker 1
You know, some people, you always tell the story of when you first saw us, you were laughing or it there are some guys in bands that might take offense to that. I like that there is a sense of humor in System of a Down's music. Me too. Because it's emotion, and you're trying to cover different emotions, not just one. And sense of humor is something I think a lot of guys can't pull off. A lot of bands can't pull off sense of humor. You don't hear it too much sense of humor in a rock music. You'll zap maybe, a little bit of some funny- But it's also the combination of how hard it is and how quirky it is that makes it funny.

[01:01:56.170] - Speaker 2
It's so extremely hard. It goes from seemingly light vocal ideas to these screaming vocal ideas right next to each other. The juxtapositions are wild. It makes me laugh listening to it just like the first time I saw it.

[01:02:21.260] - Speaker 1
I think it's just what... Like I said, none of it was done on purpose. I think it just the combination of my writing and whatever vocal style I have mixed with Serge's vocal style and the influences that we had. Our influences were heavy bands or like Cannibal Corp and things like this. But we also had influences like the Beatles, The Doors, and Romanian, and ethnic. We all grew up around that stuff. There was stuff in our roots that I don't I think, were in the roots of other bands, and it was done in an honest way. There are some bands that mix ethnic stuff with metal, but it's like, Okay, we're playing metal, and then it goes into the ethnic part. It's not a mutation that it should belong. When two people have a child and you see the characteristic of one parent and the other parent.

[01:03:26.410] - Speaker 2
It makes something new.

[01:03:28.120] - Speaker 1
But it sounds like- It's not this thing combined with this thing, and we do the A part for a while, and then we shift to the B part for a while. It's more like-They belong together.

[01:03:38.290] - Speaker 2
Together, they're making a new thing. Yes. That new thing we have not heard before. I've not heard it before.

[01:03:44.500] - Speaker 1
Yes. That's what I'm mostly proud of if I accomplish that as a writer and the band accomplishes that as a band, that it sounds like we're bringing worlds together, but these worlds belong together. They weren't forced to be together so we can be the band that mixes all that stuff together. You know what I mean?

[01:04:05.340] - Speaker 2
Do you remember anything about writing Sweet Bee?

[01:04:08.870] - Speaker 1
Again, in my room at my parents house, I had vocal phrasing, but I didn't have the words. When I brought the song into the band, it was probably like, something like that.

[01:04:26.340] - Speaker 2
You had the phrasing, but not the lyrics.

[01:04:30.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah, probably for the choruses, and Serge went off and did his thing in the verses. Yeah, that's pretty much how I brought him. But when I wrote the song itself, I can't remember exactly what. Just trying to be drivey, trying to be heavy, trying to start a pit. In those little guitar things that I sometimes did it in those days, probably more than I would in these days or even later on in the band, just little intros. It was almost like the tiny explodes into… It really does. It's like it's pushing the heavy.

[01:05:14.230] - Speaker 2
The heavy part is so much heavier coming after that. If it just started after the intro, it wouldn't have the same effect at all.

[01:05:22.490] - Speaker 1
It makes it crazy. It makes it zany. I think that's what we were going for. That's what I was at least going for. We were that at that time. Remember what we used to look like at that time? It matched the music in a way. We all were very theatrical, very made up, We looked like not from this planet in a way at that time. It all matched the way we looked, matched our music, matched the live show, matched the way we moved on stage.

[01:05:58.360] - Speaker 2
We were very- Then tell me about The album comes out, going on tour. What was the experience like of first album comes out?

[01:06:08.660] - Speaker 1
I could only speak for myself. Everything that I said I wanted to happen for myself Because I can't speak for Serge. I can't speak for you, but just for myself as where I wanted my life to go was starting to happen. I felt a lot of pressure, especially being the guy who's the main writer in the situation. I was having a lot of panic attacks all of a sudden. Just being at the movie theater. One second, I'm laughing. Next thing, my hands, my palms. I remember once we were playing at the Whisky, I I turned pale and they called the ambulance. My heart started beating really fast. I was just having like... I didn't even know what a panic attack was, but I was getting them. I had never left home before thinking things that I wanted to happen were happening, and that was positive. But once again, I was... What was I? How old was I? Like, 22, 23, maybe. So I was really young. I hadn't experienced the world. I was a kid. I had to learn how to meditate.

[01:07:22.690] - Speaker 2
What do you think the pressure was about?

[01:07:25.420] - Speaker 1
Here's your chance.

[01:07:26.760] - Speaker 2
I see. You didn't want to blow it.

[01:07:28.340] - Speaker 1
I didn't want to blow it. And that stayed through the albums, too, where it was just... I wasn't getting the panic attacks, but I just always... I really didn't want to blow it. I knew how important the second record was, and I was already thinking about the second record when the first record was coming out. We went on tour with Slayer. I mean, I had Slayer on my fucking wall with my headphones in Iraq. And now I'm on the bus with Tom and and hanging out with Slayer. Then we're on the Ozfest, and there was Ozzie. I used to have dreams where Ozzie was having dinner with me and my parents when I was eight years old. I was always obsessed I was blessed with these people. I was a big fan. I had a lot of respect. There I am in the same room, and I have an album out the way they do. Also, it felt like, okay, now Now we're being looked at with the bands that have albums out, not just the Sunset Strip bands anymore. I never looked at it as competitors, but the bands that you're surrounded with now are the top bands in the world.

[01:08:47.660] - Speaker 1
That felt like pressure, but I didn't feel like I didn't belong. I was like, I think we're good, man. Play after us.

[01:08:58.520] - Speaker 2
Historically, The opening for Slayer is a tough slot because Slayer audiences are probably the least open to hearing anyone but Slayer. How was the experience for you?

[01:09:12.280] - Speaker 1
I played the heel in wrestling, and I would mock them if they weren't yelling Slayer. If they weren't chanting Slayer during our thing, I would start them and I would say, You're not big enough Slayer fan. You're not chanting Slayer. That's how I played it. I think it worked with them because all those same places we came back and we headlined pretty soon after that. Amazing.

[01:09:38.960] - Speaker 2
Do you feel like by the end of the set, the Slayer audience was accepting most of the time?

[01:09:46.500] - Speaker 1
Some of them. I mean, we didn't... Because the way we looked was not Slayer audience.

[01:09:55.180] - Speaker 2
Not necessarily Slayer friendly. No.

[01:09:58.440] - Speaker 1
The way we It sounded.

[01:10:00.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah. That's as difficult of a gig as you can possibly do.

[01:10:05.610] - Speaker 1
It's like heavy metal boot camp if you were... Yeah. At that time, especially, too.

[01:10:11.200] - Speaker 2
First time I saw Slayer was with Anthrax, Megadeath, I can't remember who the fourth band was. From the beginning, before the first band went on, the crowd was chanting Slayer through all three bands until Slayer got on stage for hours. Slayer, Slayer, It was insane.

[01:10:31.450] - Speaker 1
No, it was stuff of legend. Those Slayer shows in the earlier, even before our time with them. You would read about it in magazines and people get hurt in the pits. It was intimidating Slayer was intimidating. The most. The audience was intimidating. The band was intimidating.

[01:10:51.190] - Speaker 2
So wild. I'm so glad you got to do it.

[01:10:55.630] - Speaker 1
Well, you had a lot to do with that.

[01:10:58.550] - Speaker 2
It really makes you good standing up to that challenge.

[01:11:02.420] - Speaker 1
Us and Europe.

[01:11:03.930] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:11:05.200] - Speaker 1
Our first tour in the US and our first tour in Europe. The Europe was a little tougher. There was one show, I think it was in Germany, where we played the same place two nights in a row. We used to open our set with No on the first record. Starts with drums and Anyway. We play the song, Nothing.

[01:11:30.860] - Speaker 2
No response.

[01:11:33.650] - Speaker 1
Crickets. We just kept playing our set. The next day, I came to the band and I said, If the same thing happens after no, John, start no again. We're going to play no until you cheer. We're going to play that same fucking song. Wow. We didn't have to play it more than twice, but we played it twice. They cheered after the second time.

[01:11:57.480] - Speaker 2
You challenged them.

[01:11:58.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That's how that went with the Slayer shit. It's like, Fuck you.

[01:12:05.500] - Speaker 2
Amazing. It was like that. You weren't intimidated by the audience. I mean, in real life, you were.

[01:12:10.500] - Speaker 1
There was this venue we played once in Portugal that they told us, If they don't like you, they throw syringes at you. We walk into this place and the roof has a bunch of syringes on the roof of the place. People throwing them up there and they've stuck up there. So I wore long sleeves and you're going up there and nobody threw syringes at us. But imagine, that's the walk.

[01:12:38.500] - Speaker 2
That's pretty rough.

[01:12:40.060] - Speaker 1
Then in Poland, they hated us once. That's a more historic system show where we get there and there's an audience and there's dudes in the front with SS fucking signs and just intimidating, and they weren't having it. They didn't like us very much, and they started throwing things at us. Serge was like, Turn on the lights. Turn on the lights. Then they threw a bagel at Serge, and it hit Serge, and they were throwing coins at me. I was playing it where I would pick up the coins and I would put them in my pocket, and I was blowing kisses at the SS guys. But Serge took it to another level, and I'm like, Oh, no, this isn't good. You're not going to be able to fight with thousands of people, man. He was like, Turn on the lights. Who threw that? Who did that? And the bagel came flying at him. That was the Poland show. These are all places we've gone back and now we're headliners. Amazing. We had some shows in Europe that not everybody understood us right away.

[01:13:53.050] - Speaker 2
Did you know that when you went back, it was going to be okay? Or not until you went back?

[01:13:58.220] - Speaker 1
We were headlining the next time the smaller theaters. It wasn't with Slayer.

[01:14:05.880] - Speaker 2
Then next time you went back, people were singing along with every word?

[01:14:10.380] - Speaker 1
It was more of an accepting audience. Yeah, it was like the London Historia, the first time we played with Slayer, the next time we went there, it was our show. The crowd was amped. We started selling 1,000 seaters, 1,500. Still on the first album or not?

[01:14:25.330] - Speaker 2
The first album.

[01:14:26.190] - Speaker 1
Still on the first album?

[01:14:27.030] - Speaker 2
Yeah. You went around two times on the first album, dealt with the Slayer audience, and then went back and all good.

[01:14:36.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah, more accepting. We were growing and the word was going out and we were building our fan base.

[01:14:44.280] - Speaker 2
Who were the other bands in the scene at the time that you were coming up? Who would have been the contemporaries?

[01:14:54.690] - Speaker 1
Corn was doing their thing. Deftones were doing their thing. I guess it's the scene that people I like to call new metal. I know a lot of people see System of a Down as new metal. We don't really see it that way. I like the word alternative metal, maybe more. I think we're a little more experimental. I think so, too. We were taking things... We had songs like spiders, aerials, atua that weren't necessarily metal influences. They could have been psychedelic influences and different kinds of rock influences. Bands we played within LA, some of them got signed. Static X, Cold Chambers, were, again, bands that you put into the new metal. But it just so happens that we were around at the same time and we came through the same scene as they did. But I never felt like we really sounded like... I like those bands. All the bands I just mentioned, I think are a really good band. But I don't think we really sounded like them. I feel like we were doing something a little detached.

[01:16:09.140] - Speaker 2
The second album is Toxicity, 2001. What would you say was different about this album than the first album?

[01:16:21.480] - Speaker 1
Vocal harmonies. First album, I had a couple of vocal parts. On our demos, there was a song called Damn, where I sang the whole song. Me singing in the band was not something foreign to the band. But in Chopsuey, there was just more vocal. Serge and I started doing more vocal harmonies on Atua, Ariel's.

[01:16:48.600] - Speaker 2
Which one would be a good one to demonstrate?

[01:16:57.060] - Speaker 1
I love atua. Great. I wrote it about Charles Manson. At what was his environmental thing. But this new metal bands were not doing this.

[01:17:20.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:17:22.750] - Speaker 3
You see me, pictures crazy.

[01:17:28.050] - Speaker 1
All the world I've seen before me passing by.

[01:17:32.340] - Speaker 3
I've got nothing to gain, to lose. All the world I've seen before me passing by. You don't get It felt very natural for me to go into this after that.

[01:17:53.830] - Speaker 1
There was nothing weird about it to me or to us as a band. That's like Simon and Garfunkle, na, na, na, na, you know?

[01:18:10.250] - Speaker 3
All the world I've seen before me, passing by. Silent my voice, I've got no choice. All the world I've seen before me, passing by. I don't feel it anymore. You don't care about how I feel. I don't feel it anymore. You don't care about how I feel. I don't feel it anymore. You don't care about how I feel. I don't feel it anymore. I don't see. I don't hear. I don't see.

[01:18:47.060] - Speaker 1
Totally normal. Nothing to see here.

[01:18:53.440] - Speaker 2
It's so funny, man.

[01:18:57.380] - Speaker 1
When we do interviews and people would be like, your time signature, and none of us are really schooled musicians, so we're not like... Just feel it. Yeah, we just feel that time signature or whatever it's going into. To me, it's just an emotional, nice song. All the world I've seen before me passing by.

[01:19:23.630] - Speaker 3
It's just... I knew that I was going to start singing more as time went on.

[01:19:52.340] - Speaker 1
I didn't want to overdo it, so there was room for growth.

[01:20:00.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the band developed over time, and one of the developments was you got to sing more, you got to sing harmony. If you listen to the first system album, the idea of the next album having vocal harmony, you wouldn't imagine it. Do you know what I'm saying? Because it's so heavy that you don't associate harmony in that music. I don't know if there's any super heavy music that has harmony.

[01:20:29.550] - Speaker 1
I don't Or that harmony. Garfunkel, Simon Garfunkel type of harmony. It's what I like to listen to, and it just comes out naturally out of the writing when you don't put limitations and walls and say, Well, this has to be heavy. We just got to be hard. It all compliments each other.

[01:20:55.740] - Speaker 2
I think- Even more, they amplify each other. It's like the hard sections seem insane coming after the Simon & Garfunkly part. Simon & Garfunkly part's nice, nice song going along, maybe moody.

[01:21:11.640] - Speaker 1
But then the- It gives you a break from the hard too.

[01:21:15.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but then the hard comes in and it's wild. Then we go back to Simon and Garfunkel, and then it gets hard again. But then it gets really hard where it already seemed too hard for what came before Now it goes to the next extreme. It's exciting because I don't know any other music that works like this. The dynamics are so extreme. In a way, it almost seems like it shouldn't work, but it does.

[01:21:49.070] - Speaker 1
Everybody in the band has to be versatile. John can't just be a heavy metal drummer. John is a very versatile drummer. Sarah Ches can't be a heavy metal singer. I can't I guess to be a heavy metal writer. Everyone in the band has to have broad taste and open mind for it to come off and be played as musicians where it works, where the style works. I know a lot of great heavy metal drummers, but they're one-trick pony, and they play that stuff really great, but probably wouldn't work on songs that I write because I need you to go from place to place, and sometimes very quickly.

[01:22:38.410] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the experience of this album coming out and going on tour for Toxicity.

[01:22:43.620] - Speaker 1
We were bigger. Chopsuey comes out. Next thing you know, we're walking in the malls and kids recognize us. That life changed after that. I guess you can say MTV was still playing videos at that time, and they were heavy rotation of Chopsuey.

[01:23:08.140] - Speaker 2
Do you remember anything about riding Chopsuey?

[01:23:10.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I was in the... Either we were still in an RV or I was in the back of the bus, and I had a guitar, and that's pretty much where the main…

[01:23:20.640] - Speaker 2
Can you grab the guitar and show me what came first? Two parts.

[01:23:22.420] - Speaker 1
The intro came first. The Once again, this is probably not tuned correctly, but I'm just…

[01:23:38.020] - Speaker 3
That came first. Now, I can't remember if I did the…

[01:23:51.900] - Speaker 1
Or if I just went into… I don't remember what came first after that, but those parts pretty much came together. The vocal came very natural. Well, the vocal pretty much walks with the… My lyrics were different. It was Wake up, tell me what you think about tomorrow. Is it going to be a pain and sorrow? Tell me what you think about the people. Is it going to be another sequel? That was my original lyrics, but I wasn't married to him. Serge pretty much sang… He didn't change the song, so I was like, So he sang Then Serge put in the repeat vocals. You wanted to that?

[01:24:35.100] - Speaker 2
Well, wake up.

[01:24:37.820] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. No, Serge took it to that other place, and I loved it.

[01:24:43.620] - Speaker 2
I never heard anything like that either. It was so unusual. I remember not even knowing what to make of it. It was so unusual.

[01:24:55.360] - Speaker 1
I didn't think it was going to be the song that it was going to be. It's our most It's a popular song. It's the song that introduced the world to us, I guess you could say. But that whole us.

[01:25:09.940] - Speaker 3
That just flowed out of me.

[01:25:16.080] - Speaker 1
The lyrics just flowed out of me. The lyrics meaning for me was how... See, I'm not sure the verse matches what my lyrics are saying, but the lyrics for me was how How people judge people on how they die. For example, if you died of cancer, poor guy, but if you died of a drug overdose, you had it coming. It's like how people are judgmental, I cry when angels deserve to die. It's like how people are judgmental even in someone's death. That's what my lyrics meant. Wake up, grab a brush, pull a makeup. Till this day, I'm not sure where that comes from and what that really means, but it fit really well. It is what it is. It's what became the song. Then this middle part, I think you have the story of where you guys… I wasn't there, but…

[01:26:11.350] - Speaker 2
Yeah, in the library, pulling down.

[01:26:12.810] - Speaker 1
Well, there was no vocals there because all I had was, Father, Father, Father. That's all I had. I didn't have the whole… I think you and Serge put that together with the Bible.

[01:26:25.830] - Speaker 2
I don't even know if it was a Bible. Whatever book it was, he pulled down and just picked it, but that did happen.

[01:26:31.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah. That's how that part came about. There you have it. You have Chopsuey, and it's our most famous song, the one that people recognize the most from System of a Down. It came to me all back when we were, I don't know where we were driving through, but we were on tour, and I was just sitting in the back playing a guitar, and that's where it came from.

[01:26:55.600] - Speaker 2
Let's hear it. We're rolling Suicide.

[01:26:59.460] - Speaker 1
Oh, and it It was called suicide before.

[01:27:21.410] - Speaker 2
Some interesting cords going on that add orchestration. It makes the part much bigger.

[01:27:29.000] - Speaker 1
I was doing a lot of layering and experimenting with layering during toxicity recording. I think you might have been the... You wanted to, though. Really? I don't remember. Really? I don't remember. Because you would make suggestions like that.

[01:28:02.700] - Speaker 3
I'm going to cry when angels deserve to die. Wake up. Wake up. Grandma should put her little makeup. I just got to pay to win. I just got to pay to win this shit.

[01:28:27.770] - Speaker 1
What do you think that keeps her from the table? I mean, Like I said, I would have never thought that this was going to be the single.

[01:28:34.150] - Speaker 2
I remember I played this for Tom Morello, and he's like, That's crazy person week.

[01:28:41.660] - Speaker 3
Again, the vocal harmonies.

[01:28:54.120] - Speaker 2
Honey, he's so good.

[01:28:59.680] - Speaker 1
Sarah and I have very different voices.

[01:29:03.150] - Speaker 2
They look so good together.

[01:29:04.740] - Speaker 1
It's a hot and cold type of thing, I think.

[01:29:11.230] - Speaker 2
It's so odd.

[01:29:17.810] - Speaker 3
And that underneath.

[01:29:31.030] - Speaker 1
Every time I hear it, there's a death metal band called Obituary. Do you remember that? Yeah, I'm like, That's where you did that. That's why you played that. You love obituary. This part's incredible, too. It's incredible. See, these are your ideas, though. Really? I think so, because you would always it has to end off big and dramatic, and this does, this like... You would lead us into these kinds of big, outro, emotional things. It works.

[01:30:14.500] - Speaker 2
It's Whatever it is, it would fit. I don't remember any details, but I just remember like- I don't remember.

[01:30:20.340] - Speaker 1
I don't remember details either, but I remember the suggestions that you would make to us and how they would change the songs. That was one how the endings would be this grand thing. Instead of just singing the chorus all over again, like let's sing it.

[01:30:37.760] - Speaker 2
Giving a reason to have another chorus at the end.

[01:30:39.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and sing it in a more dramatic and bigger- Finale. Yes.

[01:30:44.720] - Speaker 2
Any other developments during that period of the band between albums two and three?

[01:30:52.350] - Speaker 1
I think as a writer, I was starting to get into more, not necessarily starting pits, but trying to be heavy in different ways.

[01:31:04.280] - Speaker 2
I thought.

[01:31:06.810] - Speaker 1
For me as a writer, I think I was transitioning into that. I also felt like as we were going along, Serge wanted to sing more, and you pushed him more into that direction as well.

[01:31:21.180] - Speaker 2
He got to be a really good singer. I remember on the first album, it was hard for him to sing the songs. I remember live seeing the band in those days His performance was great, but his singing wasn't yet great. But by being on the road so much, he turned into a great singer.

[01:31:38.400] - Speaker 1
And great performer.

[01:31:39.630] - Speaker 2
Absolutely. But the voice really took on this operatic quality that wasn't really there in the beginning. In the beginning, it was more quirky and yelling.

[01:31:49.070] - Speaker 1
Yes, and growling. Yeah.

[01:31:51.760] - Speaker 2
Couldn't have predicted it in advance. I wouldn't know that it was going to happen.

[01:31:55.720] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I was aware of that, and he never told me I don't want to growl or anything. But I could feel like he was going more into singing than screaming. He wasn't as aggro and angry. The third album was... The thing is, I would write so many songs for all these albums that we'd ended up having either a third album or the double album. If I didn't bring in that many songs, we were We only had three records because we only had three recording sessions. First, Toxicity and Mesmerize/Hypnotize. Third album was Steal This Album. That was stuff that we didn't put on Toxicity that we thought was still good. But then remember, somebody had leaked it.

[01:32:50.080] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:51.280] - Speaker 1
That's why we called it Steal This Album.

[01:32:53.450] - Speaker 2
What's a good song representative of this?

[01:32:57.580] - Speaker 1
There's so much stuff here. I I wouldn't say it's representative of the album, but this song right here. Who was doing... I don't know. Our bands around us weren't doing this. Nobody was doing this. I mean, this doesn't show you what the album is, but this tune.

[01:33:19.020] - Speaker 3
I have a problem that I cannot explain. I have no reason why it should have been It's not heavy at all.

[01:33:25.450] - Speaker 1
It never gets heavy at all. I have no questions, but I sure have excuses. So Like I said, trying to be heavy in different ways.

[01:33:34.540] - Speaker 3
I know how I feel when I'm around you. I don't know how I Melotron.

[01:33:56.950] - Speaker 1
I think that's in culture.

[01:33:59.980] - Speaker 2
Beautiful harmony.

[01:34:03.790] - Speaker 3
Now, this is a song that I wrote and could have sang myself, but I was still in a place where I was like, didn't want to go full on yet.

[01:34:21.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:34:21.940] - Speaker 3
You know?

[01:34:25.900] - Speaker 1
And Sarah's changed the lyrics to this song from what I originally had. But once again, if I'm not married to it, it's not changing or hurting the song.

[01:34:35.530] - Speaker 2
No. If the person who's singing the song isn't connected to the words, it won't be good.

[01:34:40.230] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[01:34:41.760] - Speaker 3
I forgot that I had a solo part in this song.

[01:34:57.620] - Speaker 1
I haven't listened to this for years. I forgot that that was there. Beautiful.

[01:35:03.290] - Speaker 2
The phrasing is very Middle Eastern.

[01:35:06.020] - Speaker 1
Greek. Greek. Very Greek-like.

[01:35:10.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:35:13.510] - Speaker 1
Buzuki-like. Yeah.

[01:35:18.420] - Speaker 3
But there was more heavier stuff on this, like a song like Innervision.

[01:35:28.500] - Speaker 1
How I Could have been on Toxicity. We just didn't want to make Toxicity that long.

[01:35:34.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll just send an interview. Second song.

[01:35:39.640] - Speaker 1
Very Middle Eastern as well. This rip.

[01:35:52.640] - Speaker 3
I have a home, longing to roam. I have to find you, I have to meet you.

[01:36:00.440] - Speaker 1
Let's see, we're moving into directions that are not... You know what I mean? We're going into different places now. More melodic and more experimental. Yeah.

[01:36:15.330] - Speaker 3
Yeah, I like this song a lot. Your sacred silence Losing all violence.

[01:36:31.400] - Speaker 1
Another one is a high-way song that's on this album. That's another good one.

[01:36:35.830] - Speaker 3
I need to find you. I need to seek my inner vision.

[01:36:41.600] - Speaker 1
Mr. Jack.

[01:36:43.070] - Speaker 3
Inner vision. Inner vision. Inner vision. That's rad. Never too late to revend a bicycle's power, breaks more than a year. I'm giving you force.

[01:37:08.040] - Speaker 1
That's rad.

[01:37:09.820] - Speaker 3
Never too late to revend a bicycle's power, breaks more than a year. I'm giving you force. Yeah, it's yours. There's only one true path in life. The road that leads to all is to one. There's only one true path in life. The road that leads to all. Vision. The road that leads to all. Vision. ♪ Inner vision ♪ ♪ Your sacred silence, losing all violence.

[01:38:15.620] - Speaker 2
They come quick. Let's hear a little of the Highway song.

[01:38:31.000] - Speaker 3
I need, I feel the love. You love to love the fear. I never want to be alone. I've forgotten till the road keeps moving clouds. The clouds become unreal. I guess I'll always at home. Do you want me to try? Directing your night? An exit lights the sky. The sky becomes complete. Traveling hearts divide the throne. I Another song, like I said, in a more emotional, heavy direction.

[01:39:45.200] - Speaker 1
Although the chugging is there, the heavys there. But still more like dancy chuggy.

[01:39:50.410] - Speaker 2
It's not medley.

[01:39:52.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:39:53.570] - Speaker 2
More bouncy, dancy.

[01:39:54.960] - Speaker 1
I remember when I wrote this song, I had Deepesh Mode in mind.

[01:40:00.200] - Speaker 2
Deepesh Mode.

[01:40:00.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was like, I don't know that.

[01:40:06.830] - Speaker 2
Pick up the guitar and show me the...

[01:40:09.270] - Speaker 1
Well, I mean...

[01:40:13.640] - Speaker 2
Show me the Deepesh Mode version.

[01:40:16.550] - Speaker 1
In my head, I was thinking if the guy from Deepesh Mode was singing, I don't know. It might not be Deepesh Mode, but in my head, that's what…

[01:40:27.920] - Speaker 2
You visualized it.

[01:40:28.920] - Speaker 1
That's That's what brought the dark. If you had synthesizer… I don't know. I could hear it. Maybe. I don't know if you can, but I can hear it. I can. The way he sing. I don't know. I don't want to sing like the guy from De Bejimont, but just these cords took me there. Then there's this part where it goes, That part came from Remember there used to be freestyle music, dance music, like Timmy T. In my head, there was a lot of synth going on on that song, but there was no synth at all in the recording. But when I was writing it- You wrote it, you were envisioning since?

[01:41:33.600] - Speaker 2
Yes. Cool. The groovy part, the dancy part, is that the same?

[01:41:41.580] - Speaker 1
It's just the same chords that changes the way I play it.

[01:41:46.740] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:41:47.600] - Speaker 1
Do you If you had a 909 or something kick like that going like that. In my head, that's what was happening when I wrote that. But then you play it with a rock band, you play it with a guitar.

[01:42:19.520] - Speaker 2
But it's cool because envisioning those sounds inspired you to write a different song than you would write if you were writing a song for a metal band. So It becomes new music.

[01:42:31.750] - Speaker 1
Different inspirations, different colors.

[01:42:34.400] - Speaker 2
Then did you guys tour this album?

[01:42:38.120] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:42:39.090] - Speaker 2
It just came out.

[01:42:39.950] - Speaker 1
No. Yeah, we just put it out. Like I said, we put it out because someone leaked those songs, and they put out versions that we didn't necessarily like. So we went to your place, remember, and we redid some of them, rearrange some of them, did new vocals on some of them.

[01:43:01.530] - Speaker 2
We recorded all the songs. For Toxicity, we recorded them all and then narrowed down the ones that were going to be on the album or maybe the ones that were most likely going to be on the album, still probably more than were actually on the album, and then we would refine those. The songs from Steal This Album weren't completed, certainly not to the mix stage. No. But they were tracked.

[01:43:27.840] - Speaker 1
They were born during that time.

[01:43:30.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because they hadn't done all the overdubs or probably all the singing.

[01:43:34.130] - Speaker 1
Or even like, Mellotrons and different.

[01:43:37.920] - Speaker 2
The overdubs. Yeah. Then next is Mesmerize and Hypnotize. Any memories of that time in the band?

[01:43:49.240] - Speaker 1
Well, I had just moved into a new house because toxicity was so... I still live there, actually. I've been living there for 23 years. That's where I did a lot. I I wrote a lot of that stuff in the living room. But it was an interesting time because just the dynamic in the band had changed. Do you think just because of success or something else? I don't know. Yeah, maybe success had something to do with it. Well, Serge's heart wasn't into it the same way. Why do you think that I think the way we picked system songs to be on the record is everyone... We had a list of songs. It was very democratic, to be honest with you. Absolutely.

[01:44:41.580] - Speaker 2
The best songs, one, always.

[01:44:43.260] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, I can't tell you which one to pick. I can't tell John which one to pick, but it just so happens that a lot of the ones that were picked were songs that I brought in. Nothing was ever done. No one was trying to hurt anybody. We In my head, I don't care who wrote what song. I just wanted the best songs and the songs that worked together and made that album. I just wanted the best for the band, best for the album. We were just in a weird place where we had a member that was just not along with it the same way that he was before. I don't want to the wrong thing because you say something and then all of a sudden it becomes this, Darren said this. You know what I mean? But trying to be really careful with my words. But I felt pressure because I was like, It's a very tough time to explain for me.

[01:45:51.050] - Speaker 2
Tell me about what you remember about the recording.

[01:45:55.360] - Speaker 1
That was fine. We were at your house, Laurel Canyon house.

[01:45:59.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Where blood sugar, sex magic was me. I remember you had an idea to fill the room that was going to have your guitar amp and the acoustic guitar work done.

[01:46:13.950] - Speaker 1
We put It's like a wall of acoustic guitars.

[01:46:16.200] - Speaker 2
A wall of acoustic guitars.

[01:46:17.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I just was experimenting because- What was the thought? Well, I would go to the guitar center, and when I'd play an amp in their vintage room, everything sounded so good in there. I saw this, they had this wall of acoustic guitars, and I would be thinking, there's got to be something about the sound going through those guitars.

[01:46:39.870] - Speaker 2
Like a resonance or something in the room.

[01:46:41.750] - Speaker 1
Some resonance, and that's what I got, this twangy and it's out of my guitar. I wanted to try that with the guitar as well.

[01:46:49.190] - Speaker 2
Which was a really cool idea. I never had experimented with anything like that before.

[01:46:52.390] - Speaker 1
It was a very subtle thing that happened with the guitars, but it gave me a little bit more twang, a little bit more cut out of the guitars.

[01:47:01.020] - Speaker 2
It was a cool idea.

[01:47:02.040] - Speaker 1
Thanks. I was just trying to experiment with stuff based on that.

[01:47:07.270] - Speaker 2
Anything in terms of the writing process that was different or next level?

[01:47:15.520] - Speaker 1
Well, you were really pushing us to not repeat ourselves. I remember during Mesmerize and Hypnotize, when we showed you something that sounded like something that would belong on toxicity, you would look at us and say, We did that already. I was trying to take my writing to a place where we were just trying new things, not even necessarily metal. You had songs like Violent Pornography, radio, video that were very much system songs. Sounds like system, but something the system never did before. That's why those two records, Mesmerize and Hypnotize, I sound a bit different than the others because it was really you pushing us to go to other places and not be afraid to go to other places.

[01:48:11.490] - Speaker 2
Not be limited by the past.

[01:48:13.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah, not be limited by whatever we did before. A song like BYOB, like I showed you earlier, went from metal to this fucking P funk chorus, back to metal, into punk rock, They're very experimental songs that still fit in the world of System of a Down, but they're just done in a different way.

[01:48:40.250] - Speaker 2
Should we listen to a radio video? Yeah. Should we have a good one? Yeah.

[01:48:45.780] - Speaker 1
I love playing this song live, too. This song always comes off live. It's dancy, it's quirky, it's happy. I can't compare it to any other song I have ever written, or I can't compare it to anyone else's song either.

[01:49:11.400] - Speaker 3
Hey, man, look at me rocking out. I'm on the radio. Hey, man, look at me, rockin' out, I'm on the video. Hey, man, look at me, rockin' out, I'm on the radio. Not metal at all.

[01:49:46.630] - Speaker 1
I think I was also going into less of a metal and more into a rock direction with the band. And even with Scars, Scars even went even farther farther farther than I thought. I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to go down further into a rock. As my writing has gone along, I've gone more into a rock direction with my writing through the years.

[01:50:11.520] - Speaker 3
Hey, man, look at me rocking down. I'm Really Danny and Lisa.

[01:50:23.930] - Speaker 1
They were my friends, my neighbors, growing up in Hollywood. They lived across from me. It was almost like, look, can you see me now? I'm in this fucking van. I don't know where they are, but they were just somebody I remember from my childhood. It's almost like if they could only see me now. I'm on the radio, I'm on the They take me away from.

[01:50:47.720] - Speaker 3
Hey, man, look at me rockin' now, I'm on the...

[01:50:50.380] - Speaker 1
Got to have that.

[01:50:57.690] - Speaker 3
They take me away from. The strangest plain sauce. Sweet The only reggae groove in the history of system of a down.

[01:51:21.460] - Speaker 1
Is it?

[01:51:22.670] - Speaker 3
I think so.

[01:51:29.930] - Speaker 2
Memorable solo. Simple, memorable, melodic.

[01:51:34.800] - Speaker 1
That's the way I like to solo if I'm going to solo as a guitar boy. Another thing about it gets faster and faster. That's another thing we used to... With sugar, it gets faster and faster. So tempo, fucking with tempo.

[01:52:00.310] - Speaker 3
It could also be something in folk music where the songs would build and people would dance and spin. Yes. But once again, you were pushing us to go into different places, and I was trying to do that without losing our identity.

[01:52:34.900] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and it still sounds like... It doesn't sound like anybody but system.

[01:52:37.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I had a guy who really didn't really want to be there, to be honest with you. There was a lot of shit going on. I can't say he didn't want to be there, but his heart wasn't into it the same way.

[01:52:51.170] - Speaker 2
It's great. We recorded Mesmerized and Hypnotized at the same time. How did we release them?

[01:53:00.540] - Speaker 1
Same time? No, they were... I don't even know if the double album was planned or anything at first, but they were released months apart. Then The Souljerside intro, that's one thing I love about this record or those two records is where it starts with the Souljia Side intro into BYOB, and then the second record ends with the Souljia Side complete, and it bookends That wasn't something that was really planned. That came when it was like, Oh, we're going to do a double album. It came to me where it was like, That'd be a really cool way to bring them both together.

[01:53:43.800] - Speaker 2
Let's listen to Soulja Side.

[01:53:51.290] - Speaker 1
My uncle is in this song a lot because he was a soldier in Iraq. I see. When I wrote this song, he was still in Iraq, and the second time, America bombed them. A lot of these stuff I wrote around that time, BYOB.

[01:54:18.040] - Speaker 3
Wondering when savior comes, is he going to be saved? Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life. Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die. They were crying when their sons left. God is wearing black. He's gone so far to We went from the first record to this. It's a long way. It's a play. Wild evolution. In three recording sessions, really. They were crying when their sons left. All young men must go. He's gone so far to find the truth he's never We went from the first record to this.

[01:55:11.930] - Speaker 1
It's a long ways away.

[01:55:15.400] - Speaker 2
Wild evolution. In three recording sessions, really.

[01:55:30.930] - Speaker 3
God is wearing black. He's gone so far to find no hope. He's never coming back. They were crying when their sons left. All young men must go. He's come so far to find the truth. He's never going home. Really cinematic.

[01:56:04.280] - Speaker 2
It's like watching a movie.

[01:56:15.170] - Speaker 1
I just think as the time went along, the songwriter in me came out more in these records than writing metal songs, but just more like singer-songwriter song.

[01:56:59.000] - Speaker 3
I remember when I wrote Lost in Hollywood, Hollywood.

[01:57:15.460] - Speaker 1
And I brought in the song, and you told me, It's not finished. And I'm like, What does he mean, It's not finished? So it was just the beginning. But just you saying that, and I still tell this story, is you just had to say that to me. And then I went home that night and I wrote the whole second part of the song which made it this whole became more epic. You just made that one suggestion of saying, It just sounds like it's not finished yet. I really appreciated that, though, man. You would pull things out that I didn't know were there.

[01:58:03.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah. We all were working together to make the best thing it could possibly be, whatever that was, through loving it and honestly talking about it, whatever came up. Yeah. That's just a little bit of that.

[01:58:28.050] - Speaker 1
There's heavier stuff on this record, but for me, these songs are the ones that I like the most because it was going into different places. If I'm sad about anything about not making more records with System, it's that we never got the chance to evolve even more. To see what would be that. To go farther. You're crazy. Those vicious streets are filled with strays. You should have never gone to Hollywood.

[01:59:07.850] - Speaker 3
They find you to time you. Say You're the best they've ever seen. You should have never trusted Hollywood.

[01:59:25.530] - Speaker 2
The harmony is so cool, the notes.

[01:59:29.940] - Speaker 1
So I only had this when I first brought it in.

[01:59:39.250] - Speaker 3
I wrote you and told you you were the biggest fish out here.

[01:59:52.760] - Speaker 1
You should have never gone to Hollywood.

[01:59:58.020] - Speaker 3
They take you and make you. They looked at you in disgusting ways. You should have never tried This is the part that I went home and wrote after you told me it wasn't finished. That beautiful.

[02:00:30.450] - Speaker 1
I was standing on the wall, feeling 10 feet tall. All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevards.

[02:00:42.310] - Speaker 3
This is my frontage, this is my new rage.

[02:00:49.100] - Speaker 1
All you bitches, put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care. It gives me this vibe of all the young dudes. It has this open... Yeah. Don't stand me. Yeah. To me, this is heavy. It was very heavy in emotion. Absolutely. As the band went along, I think we would have gone more into this place and maybe not as metal and not as... Chilly It just started with the funk, but as they went along, they changed into a different direction.

[02:01:50.480] - Speaker 2
So cool.

[02:01:53.760] - Speaker 1
I think we were capable of doing that. I'm not sure a lot of bands are capable of You already made the transition from metal to experimental music and didn't lose system of a down. Yes.

[02:02:11.040] - Speaker 2
That's the hardest part.

[02:02:12.050] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[02:02:13.250] - Speaker 2
Within the realm of experimental music, there's a lot of places to go.

[02:02:17.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You really meant that, the beautiful part.

[02:02:27.650] - Speaker 3
All you like it The song's about when I was a kid, I ride my bike and you'd see people sitting at the bus stop, or there was a lot of prostitution where I grew up.

[02:02:52.350] - Speaker 1
I mean, right in front of my apartment, there was a motel, and it was a whole prostitution going on. And All those pictures are in my head when I sing this song or when I wrote this song was just all the people that I grew up seeing, didn't know them, but just grew up seeing in the streets of Hollywood that either came here with a dream or... But a lot of my childhood is in this song. I was born in Hollywood You know? So you got to see these sad stories. Just some sad, some not sad. I don't know. But just how did that person end up in this place? I would be riding my bike around the block, and how did these people end up here?

[02:03:51.460] - Speaker 2
Two interesting stats that I never made the connection before. I never thought of it as five albums, even though it is five albums. Then you mentioned The Doors. The Doors only made five albums, and System only made five albums. Then the other one is System's entire recording career was over seven years, and The Beatles entire recording career was only seven years. They made 13 albums in the seven years, but it's still seven years. It's just interesting.

[02:04:25.050] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, look, I'm proud of the records. Like I said, I don't live with any regret or anything like that, but it would have been nice to see where the band would have evolved if we kept putting music out. If we put out an album now, it's just so far away from when we did this. It doesn't continue the story to me.

[02:04:47.740] - Speaker 2
It feels like starting a new story, really.

[02:04:51.690] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I don't know. There was a time that that might have been something I wanted. I'm not sure how much I want that Understood. Anymore. I'm sure people won't be too happy to hear that from me. But yeah, I'm not at the same place where I was- Understood. Maybe 10 years ago. Yeah.

[02:05:09.540] - Speaker 2
But then again, maybe that's the place to be that allows it to happen.

[02:05:14.240] - Speaker 1
You can't predict where you're going to be and how you're going to feel.

[02:05:17.840] - Speaker 2
Impossible.

[02:05:19.600] - Speaker 1
But yeah, man. I think for a short period of time that we had in a few recording sessions, we did evolve quite a bit.

[02:05:31.140] - Speaker 2
Quite a bit. Quite a bit. A lot of growth and a lot of material in a short period of time. Loads of songs.

[02:05:40.510] - Speaker 1
We actually had even more leftover from those sessions.

[02:05:47.180] - Speaker 2
Maybe someday.

[02:05:49.150] - Speaker 1
If that did ever happen, I might want to go back and look at them again and maybe...

[02:05:54.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but the same thing happened with Steal This Album.

[02:05:57.830] - Speaker 1
It would be that thing.

[02:05:59.540] - Speaker 2
Finishing They're playing them, essentially.

[02:06:00.570] - Speaker 1
Yeah. There's a reason why they weren't on the record. They just weren't as good. In some way, they had good parts, but maybe not good completely. You never know.

[02:06:14.170] - Speaker 2
How would you say your relationship to music has changed over the course of your life?

[02:06:24.200] - Speaker 1
I was writing albums at this time. Now, I release stuff Scars, but Scars has two records out, and I have a new one coming next year. But I write at my pace now, and I write for me, and then I choose to put it out when I want to put it out. There isn't as much pressure.

[02:06:52.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but you still continue writing. Oh, yeah.

[02:06:54.900] - Speaker 1
That's what you do. No, I have tons of songs that nobody's ever heard.

[02:06:59.230] - Speaker 2
And you continue adding to that list?

[02:07:01.770] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I do have quite a bit of material that no one's heard. Some will work with systems, some will work with scars. But at this point, they're probably all going to end up going to scars. At some point. There was a time where I held on to them because I was like, Okay, we might get back in here. We might need these songs. I've just held on to songs through the years because thinking maybe and when that time comes, we're going to need these songs. I've just held on to music and enjoyed it myself. Like I said, I would be doing it if there wasn't a fan base. There'd be something missing in my life. I wasn't still writing and playing.

[02:07:54.950] - Speaker 2
What's your experience of playing live now?

[02:07:58.560] - Speaker 1
With System or Scars?

[02:08:00.100] - Speaker 2
Both.

[02:08:01.700] - Speaker 1
It's a totally different experience. With System, we're playing, I know what to expect. The band is big. You just said you came to our show, there was 60,000 people there.

[02:08:11.720] - Speaker 2
Everybody's singing along.

[02:08:13.220] - Speaker 1
Everyone's singing along. But man, I just played two shows with Scars a couple of weeks ago, one at Aftershock and one at the used to be Bank of California. There was people singing Scars songs and there for Scars, and I was I expect it a lot less. It seems like a lot of people... I don't promote the band very much. I don't put the band out too much, but there are people there that really enjoy those records and enjoy my writing and show up for those gigs. But it's different because there's a different vibe because you're working for it again. It seems like you work for it with system, but when the people are there to see you and adore you and all that.

[02:09:02.030] - Speaker 2
Sing along with songs, a lot of the work is done in the material.

[02:09:05.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you know what to expect. With Scars, I never know what's going to come in front of me. And so there's this... It's a little bit more stressful for me because I don't know what to expect. Is it going to be a thousand people there, 2,000 people there, or they're going to be 200 people there. I don't know. But these last shows, man, were really great with Scars, and I'm excited to put out this new record that I've actually been holding on to this record for a couple of years.

[02:09:38.570] - Speaker 2
It's a good sign that you can write songs, even talking about system songs, you would talk about songs from different albums that might have been written in your parents house, there's a timeless feeling about your songs where they don't sound like they're now or that they get old, that they're just good songs, and good songs seem to always be good songs.

[02:10:06.300] - Speaker 1
I think some people are like, Hey, when I hear you play the guitar, I know it's you. I'm like, I don't think it's so much the guitar. It's just the way I range songs, the way I write songs, I think if I had a signature to what I did, it's the songs. It's the songs. It's not necessarily the instrument that I'm playing. It's how I organize and how I compose and put things together that work in a way that it ends up sounding like one of my pieces.

[02:10:36.410] - Speaker 2
Because you put together pieces that don't obviously go together, but they flow very naturally in your songs.

[02:10:44.260] - Speaker 1
I have a really broad taste in music. There's so many different kinds of genres, so many different kinds of music that I love. You don't feel one way all the time either. I feel very fortunate to I'm being an artist that... I love death metal, but I couldn't just play in a death metal band.

[02:11:07.960] - Speaker 2
I love- It would get old and it would be limiting.

[02:11:10.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I've built myself in a way where fans aren't necessarily surprised when I do something different. I feel like I would do it regardless whether I can get away with it or not. It's honest to me. It's cool to be able to have that room and not be just, I have to use these heavy riffs and this vocal style all the time. I feel very free as a songwriter to be able to do what I want, and it comes out sounding like me, whether it's a song like Lonely Day or a song like BYOB. Look, I know Scars isn't his biggest system, but some of my songs that I'm really proud of, I wrote their song called Insane, Babylon, that are Scars songs that Guns are Loaded. There's some songs that I'm very, very proud of in the Scars catalog as well. I think I'm fortunate to have that outlet as well, too, because some people have that one band. I do have another band that it seems like people care about and come to see. Great. I feel very fortunate with that. Tetragrammatin is a podcast. Tetragrammatin is a website.
