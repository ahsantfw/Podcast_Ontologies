[00:00:09.050] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton, tetragrammaton.

[00:00:23.490] - Speaker 2
I was living in Maui in my twenty s and I spotted a guy in a health food shop and he had a big beard. And I was immediately attracted to him or something about his face. And so I didn't kind of do anything about it. I just saw him and I just thought, I'm really interested. And I felt a draw to this man. Anyway, a couple of days later I saw a picture of him up on a notice board. And so I saw a picture of him on a notice board and he was advertising these things called Human Design readings, which I had knew nothing about. And so I called him up and he came over to the little house I was living in and his name was Chaitan Parkin and he's written several books on human design now and he's a really great teacher. And he gave me this human design reading session in this little house in Maui. And it was really a profound moment. It caught something in me. It caught. My year was this early ninety s.

[00:01:33.020] - Speaker 1
I had no idea it's been around that long.

[00:01:35.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, yeah, Ra, the founder, Rahu, he kind of received the teaching in nine.

[00:01:41.080] - Speaker 1
Ra, yeah.

[00:01:43.410] - Speaker 2
And he's a really interesting character. He received the teaching or the transmission of that in 1987. And then it took him some years to kind of pull it together into a system and start teaching it.

[00:01:57.460] - Speaker 1
Do you know what his background was?

[00:01:59.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a little bit. He was a maverick. You would have loved to interview him. He was kind of genius, I would say intellectual genius. I don't know. I think he'd been a businessman and he was canadian. His original name was Robert Krakower and he had a successful business of some form. Anyway, his story, he told beautiful stories, was one day he was driving somewhere to pick up something for his interview he was doing or something, and he left the car running and he went into the shop to pick something up and he just had this moment and he just said to the person behind the till, do you have a back door? And the guy said, yeah, sure, that way. And he just walked out the back door of the shop into another street and never came back. Left his car running and never came back. And he just left his life. Maybe he had a wife, I'm not sure. And he headed off as a nomad. He disappeared from the world. Everyone wondered what happened to him. He ended up on the isle of Abitha in the Mediterranean, living on someone's roof. Just follow, you know, he didn't take any money with him and he just had to kind of.

[00:03:22.270] - Speaker 1
Do you know how old he was at this time?

[00:03:24.150] - Speaker 2
I'm guessing he was like thirty s. Yeah. Anyway, so he ended up living wild on the island of Ibiza. And living in a tree is what he tell this story. It's like he got this chair and he pulled it up into this tree, and he lived in this chair in this tree. And I think he was experimenting with several kind of plant medicines and things. And he went really out because he'd cut himself off from the world that he knew and had vanished. And so in that state, he received this huge teaching, this huge transmission that lasted eight days. And he received it from what he called the voice. That was all he ever said, the voice. It was kind of scary how he talked about it as well. And there's loads of good things online listening to him tell the story. He tells it way better than me. He's a wonderful storyteller. Beautiful voice, speaking voice, resonant, deep voice. And then out of that journey, he started eventually. He's kind of a misenthrope, Ra. He had this kind of very cynical about the world and people in general. He didn't really like people. He was a real recluse.

[00:04:38.890] - Speaker 2
He loved animals and dogs, and he had this beautiful dog, and he loved nature. And so that's why he lived out there. Yeah. So that was the story of Ra receiving this massive kind of teaching. And then he started to put it together. And slowly he went to Germany, ended up in Germany, started teaching it in Germany with this guy called, who was one of his first students, and I met, who's a lovely man. And eventually it started to form a little community around it. It started to kind of become quite crystallized.

[00:05:14.810] - Speaker 1
And in the beginning was the teaching just in his head. There was no writing yet.

[00:05:19.590] - Speaker 2
He hadn't written anything. He was a speaker, so he kind of spoke a lot. And then people would transcribe. And then he did write a book. It was sort of an initial book. It's known as the black book. If you can get hold of it, I'm sure it's still around. And in it was sort of raw teachings about his version of the Yi Ching, of unlocking the Qing and using it in a completely different way with this body graph, this graph, which you've probably seen if you look at human design, this nine centered graph with these different connecting pathways, channels. And it was a really innovative way of applying the Yi ching into the body and into psychology and sociology and human design has a sort of fractal layering so you can apply the principles across multiple subjects from physiology. And that was interesting, kind of exploring some of the genetic patterns. And that was where I learned about all that stuff from Ra. Well, he wasn't a scientist, but he had a good grounding into the sciences, and he had a very dark sense of humor. Right. And he wasn't into the new age or spirituality in its kind of modern form.

[00:06:36.080] - Speaker 2
He was quite cynical about, was a. He was a wonderful teacher to be around. I went, I met him in New Mexico.

[00:06:43.910] - Speaker 1
So from Maui, you had the experience first and then you went to seek him out?

[00:06:49.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think it was maybe a year later, a couple of years later, when I got back to the UK, which is where I lived, and then I thought I was going to go and study the system, learn more about it. And so I went to New Mexico to do a course, and I did. This course wasn't with Rach. It was with another woman called Zeno, who was sort of one of his main kind of proponents at that time.

[00:07:16.460] - Speaker 1
How many other practitioners were there at that time?

[00:07:18.990] - Speaker 2
It was establishing itself. It was sort of the early days, so I'm guessing there were a few hundred. But it had that kind of fresh, wild sort of wisdom feeling. And there was this community gathering around it, and there were really interesting people. And there was this feeling that we kind of all found something really magical. And it was emanating from this man who kept kind of coming out with new layers. And it was all inside him. He would just sit down in a room and he had a subject and he would just teach from this voice that came through him. And it was an amazing thing to be in his presence. There was a palpable kind of energy sitting with him. You felt like you were in the field of a revelation that was fresh and that was emerging. And the first time I met him, I sat in the back of one of his classes and he would just lecture. He just lectured. Everyone was silent. He just talked. There was no interaction. Or there might have been some questions at the end, maybe if you were lucky. And then he'd sit around afterwards or in between smoking joints and just drinking black coffee, and people would gather, and that's where you would have dialog and ask him questions and converse with him.

[00:08:35.930] - Speaker 2
So it was kind of wild. It was a wild teaching that came into the world. And then it became more and more formalized.

[00:08:45.040] - Speaker 1
Tell me more about what happens after that.

[00:08:48.890] - Speaker 2
Well, Ra came to me and we had a kind of affinity. He was a difficult man to get to know. He had an energy that was sort of a bit fuck you, keep away. And that was. It was like a shield around him. And it was very hard to get through that. Certain people seemed to have the key, but not very many. But you wanted to be around him because it was this source of wisdom. As I said, it was palpable and alive. And he came to me and he said, richard, I would love you to set up a school in the UK. Because he kind of saw that I was intelligent and grounded and that I might be able to do something with this. And I was really kind of excited about that. And he said, look, I'm going to give you the rights. I'm going to sign over the rights so you can do it in the UK. So I set up a school. I didn't know anything about setting up a school. I'd never taught anything in my life.

[00:09:55.470] - Speaker 1
Did you have a plan to have a different life?

[00:09:58.140] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:09:58.700] - Speaker 1
What was the original plan? Or what was the original plan? It would be.

[00:10:01.620] - Speaker 2
I was going to be a wine and spirit merchant. A wine merchant, which is my family business. Yes. And that was kind of. Since I was like 14 or 15, that was what I wanted to do.

[00:10:12.680] - Speaker 1
It's what your family did and you liked the experience. It's a beautiful life.

[00:10:17.370] - Speaker 2
Yeah, beautiful life, nice lifestyle, really good business. One of the oldest wine businesses in the world. Real reputation. Berry Brothers and Rudd limited. Most people in the UK who know anything about wine will go, oh, Barry Brothers and Rudd. Yeah, they're really great. It's an amazing, iconic brand. It's sort of up there with other iconic brands and often has had a long tie with Buckingham palace and managing the royal cellars and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. So I didn't go that route because this other route opened up and I started exploring these other things. So, yeah, it was a thing for me then to start teaching this wild new thing that no one had ever heard of. But it was exciting.

[00:11:07.430] - Speaker 1
Did you have enough information to be able to teach it?

[00:11:11.430] - Speaker 2
I did by then, because when you're interested in something, you're passionate about it. I became obsessed by it, and many people do become obsessed.

[00:11:19.760] - Speaker 1
So you learned everything there was to learn about it?

[00:11:22.030] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I hung off his every word. I kind of had about six or seven private sessions, readings with Ra, which you had to pay a lot for, but I just invested in that and I wanted to know everything. And there was everything he'd ever said. Basically, I absorbed over a period of years and then I started to teach it and groups came and I had articles that came out in papers, some of the big papers in the UK. People got hold of it, something new and interesting. And you had these charts, these human design charts that were kind of alluring.

[00:12:03.840] - Speaker 1
So would it work like, would you say it'd be a form of psychology?

[00:12:09.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:12:10.570] - Speaker 1
People would come to it out of wanting to get insight into themselves.

[00:12:15.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. So it was anyone that was curious about self knowledge, this was for them, because the human design gives you an imprint. It kind of works through astrological information. So you give your birth date, time and place, and then it factors that into a grid where the I ching is kind of laid out in a circle, which is really interesting. There's a whole sort of story behind that. Traditionally, when you see the I ching, it's in a square. It has these hexagrams in square. So putting it around a wheel was really interesting because it enabled you to kind of understand all kinds of hidden relationships between the symbols, these hexagrams, and then placing those into a graph of the body, of a sort of symbolic graph of the body. They're called. The body graph enabled you to kind of say things about someone. So you had this.

[00:13:13.740] - Speaker 1
Is it related to chakras at all, or. No.

[00:13:16.670] - Speaker 2
Ray would say that it was a kind of updated version of the chakras. So it went from seven till nine. And he talked about us being a new kind of transitionary being, and so that the chakra was now an outdated model. And this also kind of brought in the tradition of the kabbalah with these roots, these pathways that connect up these spheres.

[00:13:39.710] - Speaker 1
Like the tree of life.

[00:13:42.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So it synthesized quite a few, although it didn't synthesize the specific teachings of the kabbalah. It definitely had a visual connection to its tradition in some way. And so you could look at this body graph, and you can still do it online and get a lot of really interesting information. But essentially what it did is it gave you a strategy for living your life. Very clear strategies. When I first had it, my strategy, and most people's strategy actually, is to wait. The first thing Chaitan said to me is, you need to be really patient. You need to learn how to wait. Life will come to you, and through your responses, things will flow. That was a kind of taoist type teaching.

[00:14:33.840] - Speaker 1
I believe it's a kabbalistic teaching as well.

[00:14:36.710] - Speaker 2
But then there were certain groups of people who didn't have to wait. Right. They were caught. So ra began to kind of categorize different types as.

[00:14:46.140] - Speaker 1
But it was all based on this chart and based on their birthday.

[00:14:50.690] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yeah. And it was always a little bit strange that because Rai was really not into astrology and had no real training in it, and I think was a bit embarrassed about that aspect of it.

[00:15:03.080] - Speaker 1
So fascinating to have that trust in something and to doubt aspects of it as not making sense. Yet in practice, it works. It's like getting past any beliefs or baggage that we're carrying and seeing. Well, in practice, this is working. It's just interesting.

[00:15:24.890] - Speaker 2
It is interesting, yeah. And it was really interesting that it came to him. Yes. A man that was quite skeptical.

[00:15:30.370] - Speaker 1
And it speaks well for the work, that it could come through him, even though he was skeptical.

[00:15:36.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think there were a lot of questions he couldn't answer and never answered, as far as I'm concerned, but that's another story. But he was a really interesting man. I think I knew him to a fairly good degree. Yeah. And then my relationship with that system changed over the years. The school I developed became quite successful. It grew. We had sort of trainings, and I laid out a kind of program for people. I got really into it and did a really good job of it. But then what happened to me is I started to feel constricted by its language and by the kind of categorizations and the narrowness. And I kind of felt like everyone's just going out and parroting this stuff. And it was true. People were just parroting Ra. You'd have a chart and you'd say you'd have the same reading from him as you'd have from someone else. And it just felt a bit kind of rigid, even though the strategies and things were really useful, I think. I mean, I applied them in my own life and things took off for me. But what was ironic is I applied them in my own life, and then I started to diverge from the system naturally, and I wanted to explore it in a wider way.

[00:17:01.690] - Speaker 2
So I felt uncomfortable for several years with that, and I didn't quite know what to do, and I began to tinker with the language a little bit and open it up. And I think Ra was quite for that. He saw that I was reading the formulas really well because it was a system built of know formula in terms of language formulas, because it was analyzing the change.

[00:17:24.700] - Speaker 1
It was like a framework. And you were building on the framework.

[00:17:27.670] - Speaker 2
Exactly. But then I wanted to innovate more because I was frustrated with the language, and I felt like the language wasn't. Well, it wasn't fair. So in other words, you'd have someone, and they'd have a chart, and if you followed the language, you'd give them quite a negative sounding reading. And if you had someone else and they had a different kind of chart, they'd leave with quite a positive sounding reading. And I felt like the language that he'd used in the basis it was arcane. For one thing, it's very difficult to understand some of it, but the other thing was that it just didn't feel like it had a balance. An example is, I might say, oh, to someone, you have the channel of struggle. So you're designed, human design, you're designed to struggle in life, and that's a pretty intense thing to say to someone. And then another thing you might say to someone, oh, you can't trust in your intuition. And that's also a pretty heavy thing to say to someone. And so I couldn't say those things. And so I started to question it. So I was a person very highly trained in it, deeply questioning it, which was interesting.

[00:18:38.500] - Speaker 2
I was one of the only people really doing that. One or two others begun to, and because I was in this position of authority, it was a bit tricky. And then I started to formulate a whole new language for it. And that was when still rooted in.

[00:18:53.960] - Speaker 1
The same principles, but changing the language to be more, as you saw it, actually working.

[00:19:01.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm a language lover, right? I'm a linguist. I was trained in literature and poetry. I've written a lot of poetry and had some awards and things. So I kind of really love language. And so I start to apply that love of language into the system and into the I ching. And essentially what I did is I recalibrated the entire language. But then what happened was that I started to feel pushed out of the community because it was a kind of human design community. I started to feel squeezed out of the community by not even so much ra. But the people around him, they weren't approving of my language. I'd kind of diverted from the dogma, essentially. Yes. So what happened is I kind of had this very difficult situation where I just realized I had to leave and start anew, and I built this thing. I had a successful school. So anyway, I decided I'm going to go to Ra. And what I'd also seen is that I'd seen him break with many other people over the. He was a difficult man. He wasn't particularly empathic. He didn't really want to hear people. He just would cut them off if he didn't agree with them.

[00:20:18.340] - Speaker 2
And so there was a lot of littered kind of messy financial relationships that he left behind, and there was a lot of scandals and things. And I decided I was not going to let that happen. And so I went to Ibiza and I met with him and stayed with him for a couple of days and just talked it through and said, look, I'm going to have to leave and I want to go my own way, but I want to give you back the rights because you gave them. And I could have sold them, they were worth something, but it felt clean, like, he gave them to me. I gave them back to him.

[00:20:50.340] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:20:50.660] - Speaker 2
And with the recommendation for someone to take over as well. And he had the same. He agreed with the person who took over it from me. So it was kind of a clean break. And then I set off and started to create something completely new, which in time became gene keys.

[00:21:07.730] - Speaker 1
And how long did that process take to piece together the gene keys?

[00:21:11.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it was a sort of rolling, flowing process. It was like assembling a big kind of cosmic jigsaw puzzle. And bit by bit, year by year, it started to coalesce and come together. I started to meet interesting people who brought kind of key components. Like, I met this guy who had a deep understanding of sacred geometry, and he showed me how I could apply these principles also through sacred geometry. And that really helped me create a profile of my own which has spheres and pathways, but isn't the same tool as raz at all. It was more a sequential kind of tool for understanding the path of your life rather than the imprint of who you are. So if you look at human design, it's like this is claiming to say, this is who you are, which I'm not comfortable with anyway. And any piece of paper telling me who I am, I don't want to know. But this is your journey. That was more palatable for me. These are the archetypal stages of your journey through life. And that's what the gene keys started to become. And then I integrated a lot of that knowledge I'd learned from Ra, and I had my own big mystic experiences a couple of times, a couple of them, one before I'd even met Ra, way back.

[00:22:40.790] - Speaker 2
And that sort of informed where I was going.

[00:22:45.100] - Speaker 1
Tell me about that experience.

[00:22:46.820] - Speaker 2
That was in the. Just to get the order right. Yeah, it was before I met Ra. I woke up one morning in my bed into an altered state of consciousness. Spontaneously. I woke up out of sleep into a fully awakened state, which I recognized, but I'd never been in one before. I was interested in those things. But I hadn't taken anything. It was just a spontaneous thing. And it was a beautiful metaphor. You wake up out of sleep into awakeness. And that stayed with me for three days. And I traveled around.

[00:23:26.240] - Speaker 1
How was it different? Tell me how it felt different.

[00:23:28.740] - Speaker 2
There was no resistance in my body. All resistance or fear had just been taken away from my body. I mean, I can't explain that, but I felt, for the first time ever, utterly free. Because there was no definitions, there was nothing clinging to me. There was no fear, there was just no resistance. So I felt energy flow pouring through my body in a way that I can't explain. Like, I felt cosmic consciousness pouring through my body. It wasn't even my body, but I was a localized kind of point of it. And I had no idea. I didn't question it at the time. I remember having a thought, I wonder if this is going to last forever. I hope so. That was my thought. I remember that thought. I really hope this stays.

[00:24:23.770] - Speaker 1
And no idea what brought it on.

[00:24:25.850] - Speaker 2
No idea. Completely spontaneous. A causal, in that sense. And yeah, later I had some insights about it, but it's still a mystery. So for those three days and three nights, because I didn't really sleep, all I did is drink a lot of water. I didn't eat anything. And I just traveled through the cosmos and I just made the most of it. Actually, I didn't know it was going to last three days, but something in me was saying, you need to learn as much as you can out of this state. And so I just traveled with my kind of higher mind into the fractal universe. I asked so many questions and the answers were just instantly there. And there were places that, I mean, I asked questions about my future and some of the answers were there, other ones weren't. There were definitely areas where it's not permitted. I was like, I'm really interested by that. Like, oh, so omniscience even has its kind of blind spots. I thought there was something beautiful about that. But bigger things, I could see more local things about me and my life or my love life or those kind of things.

[00:25:43.600] - Speaker 2
I didn't see everything, but I did see big stuff. Like, this is how the universe works. This is our relationship to the cosmos, to the void and the time that we're in and the epochs and our ancestry and our lineages. And I filled notebooks with images and texts and graphs. And it was like, over those three days. Yeah, it was really something.

[00:26:09.610] - Speaker 1
Maybe it's that personal aspects of it are not written in the same way that the impersonal.

[00:26:16.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:26:16.670] - Speaker 1
That the big systems are.

[00:26:18.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. And also maybe it's just not permitted because in a way, your undermine it. In a way your own soul might be saying, you don't want to spoil the movie, do you really? It's like the deep part of you saying, you don't want to know this. You think you do, but you don't want to know when you're going to die or how you're going to die, because those kind of was. It was really extraordinary. And I remember sitting on, because I traveled throughout the UK in those three days and everything had a mystical significance. Every place I went to, every person I met, there were a lot of strange events that happened to me. And I ended up on this remote island off Wales called Bardsy island. And I was sitting on the top of a. A little hill, and I had to find a fisherman take me out there, and I just knew I had to go. There was a very clear voice in me just saying, go here, do this. And it was just all laid out. And I had to go to this island. And so I went and found this fisherman who ran me out there and just left me on the island for a day.

[00:27:33.270] - Speaker 2
There was nothing else there, really, but it had legends around it. Legend was that Merlin was buried there and that it's called the Isle of 20,000 saints. It's the end of a very powerful pilgrimage route from the middle ages. Lots and lots of people used to go there as a culmination of their pilgrimage. So I sat on that little hill in the sort of wind and light rain, and then this experience that I was having kind of fell off me like a blanket. It just kind of fell back into the earth. And then I was just left as this guy again, I joked the other day, I said, I was telling this story. I said, oh, no, not this guy. With all his neuroses and whatever and vulnerabilities.

[00:28:26.270] - Speaker 1
So beautiful that you got to have that experience.

[00:28:28.200] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it was an epic experience. It's always been with me, and in a way, I've been unpacking it ever since.

[00:28:41.360] - Speaker 1
So then you spent years developing the gene keys?

[00:28:44.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:28:45.220] - Speaker 1
And did you start teaching it right away, or did the book come first?

[00:28:49.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I wrote the book first. I started teaching some innovations on the 64 hexagrams, I call them. Then the 64 gifts. I discovered these gifts in each one. I wanted this new language that kind of was up a bit more upbeat. And as I went to teach that course about 100 tell me this is right.

[00:29:09.180] - Speaker 1
It wasn't upbeat for the sake of being upbeat. It was upbeat because that's how you actually saw it?

[00:29:13.550] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:29:14.520] - Speaker 1
You weren't sugar coating it.

[00:29:17.180] - Speaker 2
No. And the story was that I was on my way to this workshop to teach this workshop, which was well subscribed, a couple of hundred people in Newcastle. And I was on the train and this friend of mine, Werner Pizzal, who is austrian psychotherapist, very kind of astute student of psychotherapy. And we sat on the train and we were talking. He was kind of coming to support me and knew human design. And he was one of my friends from that era. And I was showing him these gifts. I said that there are 64 gifts in the Yi Ching. And then we were talking on the train and we said, you know, there must be shadows in each of these gifts. There must be, like, what is the shadow? So we spent the train journey, 4 hours exploring the shadows of each gift in the Jinkies book. I then wrote down those shadows and explored them in more depth. And we also discovered that underneath each shadow was a sublayer of a repressive and a reactive kind of aspect of these patterns. They're just basically human patterns. So by the time we got to the workshop in Newcastle, we had like a whole new set of keynotes to work with.

[00:30:36.730] - Speaker 2
So I had gifts and shadows, and it was like a really cool spectrum. And then that evening before I went to bed, I just thought, there's another level. Because I have this love of threes and trinities and I like, what's the transcendent level? If you have a shadow, and then you have inside that shadow, potentially a gift that can be born and a shadow being a victim pattern, a human victim pattern, might be a form of conflict that we create in our lives. Might be failure. It might be one of the words. Failure is one of the words, right? And how failure can undermine the thought of failure, the fear of failure can undermine us. But the same energy of failure, the gift, could be called preservation. So it's like that same energy, like, if you could use the energy at a higher level, then you might choose to preserve something beautiful for the Future instead of being constantly undermining yourself. So you might actually find something creative to do where you're like, passing something on to Future generations. The gifts were very creative. Anyway, that Night I thought, there's 64 keys of transcendence. And they came all that night in a kind of Rush, all of them.

[00:31:55.180] - Speaker 2
They came in an hour.

[00:31:56.190] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:31:56.930] - Speaker 2
Like really fast and clear and they came out of that heightened state that I knew from my mystical experience. And there were words like compassion, so that one preservation become veneration. And then I saw whole lineages behind them. I saw like, wow. The whole lineage of Buddhism is a lineage through that thing when it comes.

[00:32:18.980] - Speaker 1
Through like that, because it becomes so clear in an Instant. Amazing.

[00:32:26.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And then there were words like compassion. I could see the whole story of the Buddha and the Christ coming together through that one and the shadow, because I knew the e qing as well, and there were 64 of these. The language was RIch inside me, like a Fractal Language that I was discovering. And I was really excited. And so I arrived at the course the next morning with this whole Language Unprepared. And I just said to the students who were there, I said, look, I can teach you the course I plan to teach, or on the way here, it's completely changed. I can just teach from there. And they all were like, yeah. So I taught for the first, I guess, the first ever gene keys course, but it wasn't called gene keys. And we started to explore it in the room live. And it was powerful with.

[00:33:15.990] - Speaker 1
So what's interesting, what I'm hearing is, when you see the thread of Buddhism or the thread of Christ, all of these systems, or the Ching, all of these systems are descriptions of the same thing.

[00:33:33.740] - Speaker 2
Yes. But seen through a different lens, a different eye. You know those gods with a thousand eyes.

[00:33:41.300] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:33:42.880] - Speaker 2
Or the Peacock.

[00:33:44.100] - Speaker 1
These are all just different ways of accessing essentially the same information, exactly the.

[00:33:51.300] - Speaker 2
Same stream of love, wisdom, divinity, but through these different lenses. It was beautiful. And ironically, back when Ra gave me a reading years and years before, he said I would do this, he didn't know what it. He said, you will codify the spiritual ways. All the spiritual ways. And I had no idea what he meant when he said doing. He died by the time I started doing it.

[00:34:20.490] - Speaker 1
Amazing.

[00:34:21.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's nice, that image of the different lenses.

[00:34:25.260] - Speaker 1
It's interesting. It's interesting that it's all descriptions of the same. We think of them as opposing forces, when that's not the case at all.

[00:34:34.070] - Speaker 2
No, totally not. Yeah. That's why you could equally say nothing. I think that's why Lao Tzu and those other great sages just said, well, better if I don't say anything, because if I start talking, I'm talking down a stream, and people will think that there's importance in that stream, and there's so many other routes.

[00:35:00.560] - Speaker 1
Tell me how the gene keys is arranged in the book.

[00:35:04.620] - Speaker 2
Well, it's simple, really. I took the I ching, and I decided to kind of illuminate these words that I had found. So I'd found, as I said, 64 shadow words, 64 gift words, and 64, I call them cities. That's the sanskrit word city. Some may have heard of that. There wasn't a word in English to describe, like an enlightened, realized state that was different to other states. So 64 cities, and that I called the spectrum of consciousness, and that was the language framework that then became this book. I decided just to write each of those hexagrams and explore them. And so I took them at random. I didn't take them from one to 64. I just thought, I'm going to start with ten, just because it was the first one on the top of my head. I don't think I did start with ten, actually. And I just contemplated it, and I didn't refer to any old texts or eaching books.

[00:36:08.700] - Speaker 1
When you contemplated it, did you contemplate the word? Did you look at the hexagram or no?

[00:36:14.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. But I didn't analyze it. I didn't go, oh, that's heaven over earth. I just looked at it. I kind of had an understanding of those things. I had studied with this incredible man, Hua Qing Ni, chinese master, master of the Y Ching. He's got a wonderful y Ching book. Hua Qing Ni, one of the best books on the Y Ching. And he was like an old. I think he's a 74th generation teacher of the Ying, like, really long lineage. Reading his books has a certain energy signature that he weaves into the books. And I think as you read his books, you get a sense of his enlightened consciousness.

[00:36:56.980] - Speaker 1
Where is he based?

[00:36:58.860] - Speaker 2
He was based in the sort of Oregon area, west coast somewhere. He's got two sons who now run a kind of chinese medicine university. So he taught a whole load of Tao teachings. And I met him when I was out in the US and kind of became one of his mentors. He called them mentors, not one of his mentors, but he kind of permitted me to teach in his name, if you know what I mean. Yeah. And he was an amazing man. He was like this golden orb of a man and beautiful presence to be in. Had this incredible wisdom.

[00:37:40.640] - Speaker 1
Have you always hunted down great teachers?

[00:37:43.670] - Speaker 2
Not always, but some came to me, they seemed to be taoist teachers. The other one was Mantak Chia, who's a completely different kind of teacher who I studied with for many years, doing Qigung. And he was much more technique oriented teacher. I read his book. Yeah, great, great. Kind of crazy man. I love his way of teaching. Very technical, very practical. Yeah. But also the Tao that seemed to be. I had a strong draw. I mean, I went to India in those places, and I also explored the chakras and those kind of teachings and a bit of Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism, but it seemed to be the Tao that had a deep hold on me, these chinese sages. Yeah. So that's how I wrote the JiT. So I contemplated each key, and however long it took me before, I felt like I had something to say. But what happened for me was it became alive. So I took three keynotes and I contemplated them, and then they came alive in my life in some way. So something happened, like an event, or if it was failure or something. Suddenly I met someone who had just failed dismally in something, and there was this whole story, or sometimes it was my own experience.

[00:39:02.390] - Speaker 2
Something came up for me.

[00:39:03.630] - Speaker 1
You would have an experience that would give you insight into the subject.

[00:39:07.900] - Speaker 2
Exactly. So that's how I wrote the book, out of a living understanding. So some keys came quite quickly.

[00:39:15.600] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:39:16.090] - Speaker 2
And others took a long time, months before, until something had happened. I couldn't rewrite about it. And. Yeah, so it was a real process. And it took about four or five years of writing, the first pass of the book. And then I got hold of an editor who helped me refine, and then I wrote another whole layer to it because it didn't have depth. It didn't have enough depth. So I went in and I did another rewrite, which was more focused all in one burst, but it took a couple more years, and then. So in total, it took about seven years.

[00:39:55.690] - Speaker 1
Did having all 64 in front of you help the refining process?

[00:40:01.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah, definitely. I had the strangest feeling when I put the final full stop on the last one, I was happy, and the last one was Gene key 22. It was one that Jojo was never happy with. And then I suddenly got it after I'd been very, very sick. And it's the key of dishonor and grace, and it's really like a master key. Those double digit numbers are like there's something special about them. 20, 211, 33. And they have some special kind of teaching in them. Anyway, so I got been sick, my whole family was sick, and I was sort of trying to care for my young kids while they were sick, while I was sick. And it was just a miserable, miserable time. And my wife was sick, and we were all stressed, and it was awful for like two three weeks. And then out of coming out of that sick period, I wrote the 22 and then finished the book. And it was all about the nature of suffering. That's what it's about, that one. The kind of core nature of suffering and what I call the sacred wound. And when I finished, I had this strange experience of like, wow, I've somehow taken the experience I had in the day experience and I put it in a book.

[00:41:22.900] - Speaker 2
I realized that I'd done that without realizing that's what I'd done. Just the stream of that kind of awakened consciousness, seeing it through all these lineages and lenses, I had been guided to do it in this book, the Gene keys, it was then called at the end. I called it the gene keys, and I wrote the introduction at the end because I had no idea how to use it.

[00:41:45.950] - Speaker 1
How did you come up with the title?

[00:41:47.670] - Speaker 2
I think it was a title I played with early on because I realized the relationship between DNA and the know which you and I were talking about recently. And it's an extraordinary mathematical relationship. It is pure mathematical. So when you look at the hexagrams of the Yi Ching and they're made up of trigrams, which are made up of. So hexagram is six lines in a line, and there are either broken lines or unbroken lines. Yin and yang, they're called. And those are called. When you have a broken and an unbroken line, that's called a bigram. So in other words, when you combine them in twos, you end up with four bigrams, right? And those relate in a way to the four bases, nucleotides of DNA. And then they form triplets through what are called trigrams, which are combinations of those nucleotides. And then they expand out into 64, which are the codons, the patterns of our genes, of our dna. So any geneticist will recognize that language instantly and go, oh, yeah. But also when you go deep into the Yi Chang and you see that underlying structure, you realize that that is the pattern for life.

[00:43:00.580] - Speaker 1
And it's in a 3000 year old book before any of the western understanding of this information existed.

[00:43:07.680] - Speaker 2
Totally. Totally. And it was a guy staring into the back of a tortoise. That's the legend. Anyway, sitting on the edge of the Yanktee river, the tortoise climbs out. This guy is lying there in the sun, and he looks at the tortoise's back and the kind of interlocking patterns of the tortoise's back, and he suddenly has this epiphany and he writes down the. He draws these birams, these trigrams, and that becomes the foundation for what's called the bagua, which you see on the korean flag, for example. It's that. And that then spawned the Yicheng as an oracle, eventually became an oracle. I think in its early days, it probably wasn't used in that way. I think it was used as a spiritual practice because that was how the Genkis used me. I became its student, and through contemplating them, I changed something in my DNA. And by the time I finished that book, I was know I literally had gone through a whole cycle where my biology changed, my shape changed. I had the same experience with people who've translated it. I had this lovely man, Ollie, who's Romanian, who translated the Genkis book into Romanian, and he came to me and he was cursing out, you would love him.

[00:44:28.720] - Speaker 2
He was a drummer in a death metal band, right? I don't know how he got to be the translator of the Genkis, but his life utterly changed in translating this book. And he lost a huge amount of weight while he was translating it. And he went through a whole series of revelations in the early days. I joked, I said, this is a book that talks to your dna. I think it does. I think many people have talked to.

[00:44:55.260] - Speaker 1
Yours, and that's why they'd exist.

[00:44:57.070] - Speaker 2
Exactly. So there's a fundamental pattern somewhere at work here. And then I started to explore it in other areas as well. And I started to. Musicians would start coming to me and saying, you know, the octaves are also a 64, the eight octaves. And architects would come and say, well, you know, the phi spiral and the Fibonacci sequence, like, those are also sixty four s. And then our technology, 64 bit technology that allows the computer to operate, and our phones, it's all 64 bit technology. It's the same binary coding that is littered throughout the universe. Even some of the kind of fringe physicists are saying that the potential structure of spacetime is a 64 fold tetrahedral grid. Because you see it kind of when you map these geometries, these sacred geometries, vector equilibrium, and you're mapping the kind of structure of spacetime, it also may well have a 64 fold pattern. So it's a fundamental pattern of life. And what came out of that, and this was the understanding I had in my three days, that we live in a hologram, a fractal hologram, where everything is a map of everything else. So that contained in one kind of tiny photon is the whole universe, or contained.

[00:46:32.020] - Speaker 2
It's the insight of Blake the great poets or Shakespeare, and everything is encoded inside everything else. So we're living in this simulated holographic universe. I know that's getting kind of deep, but that's the revelation of this code, of the dna, of the gene keys. So that's why I called it gene keys, because I realized these were keys that related to our dna, and I wanted to make that link. Yeah, it's interesting.

[00:47:07.860] - Speaker 1
I had an idea. How about take a look through the art of contemplation and read us something that speaks to you?

[00:47:15.910] - Speaker 2
Sure. Let's see. Here's a nice part. You know, the reward of pausing the mind of light, your new gift of insight, can bring some extraordinary rewards into your life. Chief among these is lucidity of mind. After some time, you will find that your mind grasps the essence of any particular problem spontaneously and effortlessly. The main hallmark of a lucid mind is its ability to transform any challenge into a creative opportunity. As you learn the art of contemplation, you will even find that your thinking itself begins to pause as little spaces begin to open out between your thoughts. A clear mind repels both doubt and confusion. This new sense of inner spaciousness can give you a fresh confidence in the power of your own mind that you will transmit everywhere you go and in everything you do. I'll just say one more bit. In JApan, where the art of contemplation has been perfected through the incisive practices of Zen BudDhism, one of the characters used for the word contemplation is. And there's an image of the character. The literal translation of these two characters is light flashed through the mind. Many human beings have intuited that the mind operating at its highest potential is connected to the notion of light.

[00:48:40.900] - Speaker 2
We speak of flashes of intuition, of illumination and enlightenment. All the great mystical traditions allude to this inner light that exists in a state somewhere just beyond our ordinary mind. The highest goal of the art of contemplation is ultimately to reveal this inner light. So that's the reward of learning, the art of pausing, which is the foundation principle of learning to contemplate.

[00:49:11.680] - Speaker 1
So in contemplation, are the spaces between the light as important as the light?

[00:49:17.670] - Speaker 2
Yes, absolutely. Yeah. And this book came about after the gene keys. And it's funny in a way, because I kind of wrote it in response to my father, who, when I showed him the Gene keys book, said, I don't understand any of this. And he was a practical man, a businessman. And so I said, okay, I'll try and write something else. And I wanted to write this book anyway because I realized people were asking me, how do you do the gene kits? Like, I love the wisdom. And there were these profiles that you could get, and you can explore all that stuff online, but then people would say, how do you do it? And I said, the secret is the art of contemplation. So I wrote this book, the art of contemplation, short book. It's my desert island book, under 100 pages, where I just distilled everything down to this single technique that is ageless and timeless and hasn't really been explained very often, strangely enough. I mean, we have a lot of descriptions and techniques around meditation and mindfulness, but not so much. What's contemplation? We kind of tend to think it's like thinking about something a lot, right?

[00:50:35.800] - Speaker 2
And so I took this beautiful word, contemplation, and then in this little book, show how it's a spiritual practice that many people can grasp very easily, much more easily than meditation. And it might include meditation as well, or it might not. It might include riding your bike. It might include playing music. Contemplation is a very broad, generous, creative field. You can do anything in a contemplative manner. So it opens up a whole beautiful technique. And what I just read is, one of its highest possibilities is that as you learn to do things in a contemplative way, which involves pausing, because contemplation is not a fast word, it requires that you do things slowly and that you pause in between activities so that you can integrate things more clearly. I mean, this is how I wrote my jinkies book. I took seven years. Contemplate, taking my time, not rushing, not kind of planning. You can't plan contemplation. It's not a strategic word.

[00:51:55.120] - Speaker 1
In some ways, the book on contemplation is a how to read the gene keys. It is, although how to do anything.

[00:52:02.950] - Speaker 2
It's how to do anything. Do you know what? It doesn't even mention the gene keys, that book. There's no jargon in it. And it's how to do anything. In a way. If I've ever written a masterpiece, I'd say it's that little book, because it's just distilled and it's practical, and anyone can learn to pause. Anyone can do it.

[00:52:27.290] - Speaker 1
If I wanted to get into the gene keys, what would be the entry path?

[00:52:32.680] - Speaker 2
This, I would say, yeah, learn to contemplate, and you can apply it to business. If it's something that leads you to lucidity and wisdom, surely that is the most precious thing anyone can have. I mean, there's love, but it's an aspect of love. The mind of light is wisdom and love coming through the mind. So it's the heart mind at work. So if you can see through the heart in lucidity, you can apply that to every decision you make in life. And that decision will be a decision rooted in flow, good fortune, rhythm, harmony. But you have to slow down from being in a stress state. And that's what this little book kind of invites you to do, makes you more relaxed.

[00:53:29.660] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the triple flame.

[00:53:31.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the triple flame is in the back of the book are a bunch of little exercises that I wrote later, and I just thought, here are some fun things you can do to help you enter the field of contemplation. An example is there's a whole section on lingering. It's like, try and linger a bit more often. When we finished something, we rush straight onto something else. And actually lingering is that quality of just being a little bit more lazy and just allowing things to just stretch out a little bit more. And it's in that lingering. And I use the example of you're having dinner with a bunch of people, and then some of you have to go home, but you decide to stay on. It's in that lingering state that the most interesting things always come out. There's a few people left. There's three or four of you there. You're lingering. Maybe you had a few drinks or whatever. The conversation suddenly opens up.

[00:54:28.110] - Speaker 1
It's like it's off the record. Exactly.

[00:54:30.660] - Speaker 2
And you can apply that lingering to anything in life. And I say there's other words, like sauntering, meandering, like if you're walking somewhere, give yourself a bit more time so you're not rushing in a straight line from, if you're going to work, give yourself an extra ten minutes and go through the market just for the hell of it. Just or along the river just for the hell of it. Because when you get to work, I guarantee you'll get there in a way better space and more prepared.

[00:54:59.280] - Speaker 1
Powerful in that. So much of today's society is about efficiency. And this is the anti efficiency message, which is really helpful. It is.

[00:55:10.310] - Speaker 2
But ironically, it actually creates more efficiency. Yes, because you don't waste energy, because you have lucidity. So rushed decisions lead to wasted energy, stressful decisions lead to wasted energy. Things go wrong, so you waste energy. It's entropy.

[00:55:28.090] - Speaker 1
It's one of the things with meditation where I've heard it said that I don't have time to meditate. If you spent half hour meditating, you would have so much more time in your day.

[00:55:38.810] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yeah. And so the triple flame is a little pausing technique that's a bit more structured. And we created an app for this, the triple flame apps on the App Store. And it just requires pausing every 3 hours for three minutes. So really simple. I don't think there's anyone that can't do that. It's that simple. So three 6912 o'clock, you pause for three minutes and the app just gives you a little ding. And you can either choose to do a little guided three minutes meditation or chanting or whatever you want, or you can just sit quietly. Or if you're in the middle of an activity that you can't stop, you do it for three minutes in really intense state of kind of relaxedness and awareness, mindfulness. So you start to create these little pauses throughout your day and then you start to string them together day after day after day, week after week after week, month after month after month. And it starts to have a really strong subtle impact on your biology, on your psychology, on your emotions, on your, you know, you start. That's why I said the reward of pausing is eventually you have those experience of the mind, of light.

[00:57:00.710] - Speaker 2
You begin to see things in real lucidity. You actually begin to inhabit a meditative state because you've kind of tricked your body into pausing. And what will happen is you will pause outside those three hour windows.

[00:57:14.540] - Speaker 1
You're training yourself to be able to pause.

[00:57:17.220] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And then you will also. Probably what will happen is you'll stretch out those pauses because you enjoy them so much.

[00:57:23.750] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:57:24.190] - Speaker 2
And so you might stretch it to ten minutes or even an hour if you're really good at it.

[00:57:30.190] - Speaker 1
I learned this method from you some time ago and practiced it before there was an app just on the three six nines. And really love it. I love it. It's so simple and profound.

[00:57:44.570] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it is. And there's another lovely element of the app is I asked the guy who created the app to show how many people are pausing with you right now, which I think is a lovely feeling because across different time zones, people are pausing at three six nine. And you can reset, you can set the app, I think in the next version you'd be able to change it to whichever time zone you want. So you can pause, same as the west coast of the USA, or you can pause with people in Africa or wherever they are. And the plan is to create a map so you can see the wave of pausing around the world of people pausing. So there's this also feeling of, you're not alone right now. In these three minutes, there are 54 people, or 154. A thousand. That's the goal, really is like 10,000 people pausing right now for three minutes. That'll have an impact.

[00:58:42.910] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[00:58:43.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:58:44.610] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the ecosystem of the gene keys in the digital world.

[00:58:49.460] - Speaker 2
Well, interestingly, I have a really great little team of people at gene keys that we built organically, and we love each other and know each other really deeply, and we live the teachings and we have a lot of fun and we've built a business out of it, and we're committed to certain principles like generosity and affordability and integrity and those things. So we keep it very affordable for people and it's growing. And early on, we decided, let's try and do an online retreat, right? One year we're going to do an online. No one had done any online retreats. This was way before the pandemic and zoom and stuff. But we put together this idea and we created an online retreat which lasts three months, following through some strands of your gene keys. So each person would have their profile and they would go through the four gene keys that relate to your sense of purpose, to unlocking your purpose. It's a contemplative program, and it was four months. So we created, like, this one key a month. Right. So you had a lot of time to really explore that key in your life, and each key unlocked a different aspect of your genius or your purpose.

[01:00:08.880] - Speaker 2
And we had about 500 people, and the first one was really great all around the world. And we did this online kind of rhythmic retreat that got people into the teachings, but also kind of stayed in their lives. So they actually integrated it into their daily life instead of going off on retreat and then coming back and having a big experience and then coming back. And how do you integrate that? That's quite challenging. So we thought, let's do it in life. And it was hugely successful. And then over the years, we developed these online retreats and really got good at them. And then the pandemic hit, and we were completely set up and we were just about to launch our biggest ever online retreat, which was about love and relationships. And we were experts in Zoom and all those things that people had, we were dialed. So we hit the ground running. In the pandemic year, we did this huge six month retreat on love and relationships with thousands of people who signed up. And it was really powerful having that global community and people could do it. At their own level. So we designed these retreats so that it doesn't take over your life.

[01:01:28.830] - Speaker 2
It just zings along in the background and you can dip in whenever you can. It's like you come in depending at the level you can give. So maybe one month you had more time, so you gave more, but the next month you were really busy, so you had to go in a bit lighter. So we got really good at kind of essentializing truths and things so that.

[01:01:49.780] - Speaker 1
People could there be like assignments, themes.

[01:01:53.620] - Speaker 2
Each week, each month. So we draw out the essence of, like, you need to watch this. It's only ten minutes.

[01:02:00.570] - Speaker 1
Or like a video course.

[01:02:04.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's something like that. But also with live, we call them community calls. So in the second week of each month, always we had community calls where people could come together in different time zones and meet and discuss, meet each other and discuss their keys. And then we'd put them into little chat rooms of four or three or four people randomly. And people had incredible experiences meeting people. And we start to see all kinds of patterns of like, wow, I was in a room with three people and they all had the same keys as me. If we didn't do that deliberately, or I was in the room with someone and I'd had a car crash and they'd also been in a car crash. And so we had so many of these stories. I can't tell you how many synchronicities occurred in these retreats. And people met and fell in love with each other and got married, and people made friends for life, and people went traveling across the world to someone they'd met in one of these retreats. So they were really powerful. And we still do them today. We're still doing them, and we're trying to kind of have it so that the time is not.

[01:03:15.240] - Speaker 2
You're not spending too much time online. But essentially, I've created these online self study courses for the gene keys that you can do in your own pacing and your own rhythm. And it's not too much. And I've done books as well, so I've written the hard copy books as well for each of the called sequences of the gene keys. Understanding your gene keys and your profile. So it's really popular, and people are reading those books and exploring their keys and loving it.

[01:03:49.050] - Speaker 1
Is there a way to go online and put in your birth date and find out what your keys are?

[01:03:55.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah, genekeys.com. And then profile free profile. And you put it in and then have a look. It gives you a bunch of words it gives you some little paragraphs and if they resonate, then you might want to take it a bit further and come and do one of the actual online courses or programs or get the book. Or get the book. Yeah, the books that take you through your profile, which are called the sequence books, they're also on Amazon. It's all described online. And there's a little course about to come out new to the gene keys that will show people much more clearly how they begin. But it's kind of wild. And I'm not a teacher in astrology. I'm not an astrology guy either, but I'm really interested in that. Like why? How? Because that puts a lot of people off. They go, well, I don't believe in astrology. It's nonsense. But I have a lot of good skeptical friends around me and I have great conversations. And one day it came to me as I was talking to this old friend of mine, this man in his eighty s, and he was like, I don't believe in that nonsense.

[01:05:03.450] - Speaker 2
And we were talking and I said, well, you know how we see the universe has fractal patterns in it, right? So we look in the same pattern that we see in a nebula. You can see when you cut open a cell or slice a grapefruit in half, you'll see self similar replicating patterns throughout the universe. The fractal patterns, right. And space has fractal patterns woven into it. And if space does, then time must, because time and space can't be separated. So time also is fractal. And what does that mean? It means that every moment contains a pattern, a signature that reflects some aspect of the whole. So when you look with the gene keys, you put these 64 fractal patterns and then you put them into a time clock. It's like you're looking at a map of fractal time. And this is how I've understood what astrology, the core insight that led to astrology, how you read it, is another whole thing. Yes. And whether you're any good at reading archetypes and the symbols, but in the gene keys, it's 64. So you're looking at a 64 fold fractal map of time, which you can put around the clock of the year.

[01:06:32.190] - Speaker 2
So it gives you touchstones to contemplate, but it doesn't tell you who you are, it just gives you something to contemplate. And they really tend to resonate with people. I don't know. That's what people are finding.

[01:06:47.660] - Speaker 1
Is everything based on patterns?

[01:06:51.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I would say so. But some of the patterns are wild. They're not like we think of patterns, we think of euclidean geometry, whereas wild geometry is kind of more chaotic. Yeah. Like an oak tree growing that it's not so easy to predict which way. So that's also a pattern. But there's a perfection even in those wilder patterns. And chaos theory, right? Chaos theory is showing that even within chaos are underlying principles, the branching into threes.

[01:07:31.610] - Speaker 1
For example, when we do interior work, is it happening inside of our body?

[01:07:39.670] - Speaker 2
You got some good rascally questions. Yeah. Because the body is the kind of foundational hologram. So every cell of our body, when we go inside, when we close our eyes and we go into our inner world, our body is the kind of baseline, it's the anchor. That's why the Buddhists teach breathing. And the most ancient techniques are always around breathing or chanting, because it just brings this rhythm deep into your body. Contemplation does the same. It brings you eventually to awareness of your breathing because it slows you down. And when you slow down, you become aware without doing a technique of breathing. So the body is like that kind of anchor place. It's the field where transformation occurs. It might occur there last because it's physical. So you might experience an emotional transformation quicker. But then how that gets communicated into the structure of the body, because it's coarser, matter may take longer. So transforming the body in that way can take longer physical patterns, if you know what I mean. Yes.

[01:09:09.650] - Speaker 1
Tell me about faith.

[01:09:11.370] - Speaker 2
Faith, it's a beautiful word, faith. I don't use it in the gene keys. There are many words that appear in the gene keys, like faith doesn't appear. Trust doesn't appear. Hope doesn't appear, yeah, faith, it depends on how you look at it. You've got to kind of extrapolate it away from religion maybe. And then it becomes very akin to trust, because if you've really come into this place inside you where you've found that pause, that eternal pause, that's when you reach faith. There's no doubt in it. And it's not belief either, to me, true faith, it's not belief. It's not something you've constructed. Like, I read the Bible or the Bhagavad Gita, and that's given me faith. It would be something that came from a real lived experience of divinity inside. And that is what creates faith. It's a direct knowing. It's a cellular certainty. That's what it is. It can never be taken away from you once you've felt it's very akin to grace. Grace is another word that's like.

[01:10:34.430] - Speaker 1
It's interesting, the idea of the difference between knowing and belief, and they are very different.

[01:10:40.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's like when they asked Jung, do you believe in God? And he said, I don't believe. I know. That's a completely different answer.

[01:10:53.970] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:10:54.870] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:10:55.910] - Speaker 1
Talk to me about the power of numbers.

[01:11:00.390] - Speaker 2
Numbers are great, aren't they? They are great. I got some mathematical friends, and one of the things that I realized in my mystical state is that everything is made of numbers. Everything. And sometimes I remember walking through a forest, because when you look through the gene keys, you're looking only through 64. Right. But they're the numbers of eternity. So they go on and on forever, like the Fibonacci sequence. Like math, pure math just goes on and on forever. Or PI, on and on forever. So they are a way of kind of training the left brain to see infinity, to see and grasp the infinite. But they can only take us to the precipice. Like, in a way, they take us to logic, which is founded on numbers. And science, which is founded on numbers, essentially can only take us to the very edge, the precipice, the paradox. And then beyond there lie dragons, as the saying goes. So numbers are beautiful because the construct of our, what the ancients call the maya, they call it the maya, the illusion, the fabric of spacetime. The illusion is not quite the right word because it gives the wrong impression.

[01:12:29.190] - Speaker 2
But the fabric of the construct of our reality is made up of things that can be counted and numbers, like pixels. The scientists are going on smaller and smaller and smaller numbers and greater and greater and greater numbers, but eventually they get to the same place. They both get to paradox. They get to the infinite. And so there's a place where numbers point towards that, but then they stop, literally. And there's a lovely quote by poet Norman Nicholson. He says, the infinite adjusts itself to our need. I love that, the infinite. I've contemplated that a lot in my life. Infinite adjusts itself to our need. And I think numbers kind of are wonderful because they're the foundational construct of our reality. But there's a point where you can't really understand the mystery unless you go beyond the number. Yes.

[01:13:31.110] - Speaker 1
It's like if you could see the fabric of reality, the pattern going on forever, the part that was close to you, you might be able to analyze and understand, and it just repeats forever. But at some point, you can no longer measure it.

[01:13:51.870] - Speaker 2
Exactly. I mean, I love scientists. I just find them sometimes hilarious. Like the other day, I heard a scientist saying, we think there may be more than one infinity. So you have to listen to yourself sometimes and go, okay, it's just beautiful. But there's a point where you have to enter into the mystery, and it's quite hard for the left brain to let go and then move into the right brain territory, which is the whole, which is where you have to inhabit the mystery. And that's the only way you can ever know all of it. So a theory of everything, according to me, is not possible.

[01:14:35.440] - Speaker 1
Yes, no, I understand. What else do we know about the 64?

[01:14:41.340] - Speaker 2
Adds up to ten. Yeah, well, it reduces down to these 816s. It's eight by eight. Yeah. It contains all these fractal kind of. This is what the gene keys are. It contains these fractal kind of universal lenses. So every key is like, opens up. It's like an encyclopedia when you open it up. So contemplating on one key is like opening up an entire eye on an entire universe. So you can look through each one of these lenses.

[01:15:22.470] - Speaker 1
Would you say each one of them? When you look through the lens, you're looking through it with a particular emotion? Is that what the words. What are the descriptive words for each of the keys?

[01:15:32.820] - Speaker 2
Well, they might be creative words or they might be practical words, like a gift. The six gen key. Six gift is diplomacy. Right. So that's a process word, but it's also creative because you're constantly having to learn diplomacy in human relationships, and that key is all about human relationships. It's transcendence is the word peace. So how do you find peace? You find it through learning the art of diplomacy until you've arrived at peace, and then you no longer need the diplomacy, because it's a part of who you are. And diplomacy doesn't just mean being kind of nice. It's about really, really listening and empathizing with all of life. And that's what peace is. So each key can have an emotional component, it can have a process component, it has a transformation woven through it. So every one of the 64 is a pathway to transformation. So you can actually just take one at random? Many people use my book like that. They just use the book and nothing else, and they just open it and they read it. They read one, and that becomes the thing they contemplate.

[01:16:49.170] - Speaker 1
I'm going to pick one at random now.

[01:16:50.760] - Speaker 2
Cool.

[01:16:51.220] - Speaker 1
And I want you to tell me about whatever comes. Okay. 29th key, leaping into the void.

[01:16:59.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So the shadow of this key is a lovely word. It's not lovely, but it's half heartedness. Right? And the gift is called commitment. And the city is called devotion. I love this one. And the original Yi Ching name for it is the abysmal, which is a great word. I love the poetic word, the abysmal, the abyss, leaping into the void. And so if you're going to leap into the void, you can't do it half heartedly. Right? And so this key is all about saying yes and how we don't say yes fully. So think about relationships. Like, I discovered this through default in my own way, right? I discovered that there was a part of me, as a man that always held a bit of myself back in relationships. And one of my teachers said to me, he was a relationship counselor teacher, and he said, in a relationship, 99% commitment is the same as 1% commitment. That really blew me away. He said, because you're either committed or you're not. If you're holding something back, you're not fully in it. Well, I might meet someone better. There's a little part of me that's like, yeah.

[01:18:19.890] - Speaker 2
So I had to learn that through myself in my relationships. And when I finally saw that, that I wasn't fully in it, I finally realized that was the moment I fully committed. You can't make that decision. It just happens.

[01:18:36.470] - Speaker 1
And it's not just in relationships.

[01:18:38.490] - Speaker 2
It's in everything. It is in everything. It's in creativity. It's in everything. Everything you do, yes. If you do something half heartedly, it's bound to fail, if you know what.

[01:18:50.600] - Speaker 1
I mean, or not be good.

[01:18:52.140] - Speaker 2
Either way, it's just not going to lead to fulfillment.

[01:18:54.730] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[01:18:55.120] - Speaker 2
Okay. But also, it has value. Every shadow has value. Right. Because it's going to teach you where you're not committed. If there's something you're doing in your life and you're doing it half heartedly, really look at that thing and contemplate it and realize that through that area of your life, energy is leaking and that leak is causing you pain. It's causing your biology pain. It might be causing problems in your biology. It will be because everything's connected, like we said about the body. So half heartedness is a great thing to find in yourself. If there's anything you're doing half heartedly, realize it, and then you can recalibrate.

[01:19:38.750] - Speaker 1
You can recalibrate and either not do it. Not do it or do it.

[01:19:42.400] - Speaker 2
Exactly. So commitment is about where you then give yourself 100%, and commitment leads to devotion. It is the process of transforming half heartedness. That's what it is the gift, is the process of transforming the shadow. It arrives at the city, right? So it arrives at. Do you do something with utter devotion? It's like you as an artist. You see so many artists, and that devotion is like, it's the only thing they want to do. It's the only thing they can think of. That is when things just really kind of. Because you're doing your life's work, you're doing something you're designed to do, because every cell of your body's behind it. That's devotion. So it's a beautiful key that teaches us about half heartedness and lack of commitment and commitment and then full devotion.

[01:20:40.820] - Speaker 1
So other things here listed in the 29th key are the programming partner, which is the 30th gene key. What is a programming partner?

[01:20:49.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So when you put the keys, 64 keys, in a shape around the wheel, this is kind of a bit nerdy for eaching people, but it's fun as well. What you see is that opposite one key is in the wheel. If you put them in a 64 pattern, is its exact opposite hexagram, right. So if it's Yinyang. Yin Yang. Yin Yang, then this one is Yang. Yin Yang. Yin Yang, yin opposite. So I call those the programming partners. So every key is part of a binary, in a way. So whether you're working with your profile or you're not, it's really good to understand the other side, because they're archetypes, right?

[01:21:33.440] - Speaker 1
And they balance each other.

[01:21:34.610] - Speaker 2
I imagine they imbalance or balance each other. So they create biofeedback loops. So at the shadow level, they create negative biofeedback loops. So the shadow of 30 is desire. Right. It's the force of desire. So you have desire and half heartedness, and there's a kind of dance between those two. There's nothing wrong with desire. There's nothing wrong with half heartedness. It's just a starting point. So we get to learn about our desire and lack of through half heartedness. And by following our desire, but not fully, we learn all these different things. And then desire gets transformed into lightness. That's when we are able to. We're not sucked in by our desires. We don't become our desires. We have a little bit of pause around them so that we can follow them or not follow them, and then we have clarity so we can choose which desire to follow. Which desire maybe to just kind of hold. Because if we follow every desire in our life, it can lead to chaos. Right. So it's about how we deal and handle with the energy of desire. So those two keys, especially at the higher level, you get to see devotion and rapture.

[01:22:58.090] - Speaker 2
Rapture is that state of where desire has actually been transformed into this kind of beautiful state of bliss, where it doesn't matter if you follow your desire or if you don't follow your desire, you're in bliss. So it doesn't matter. So you can choose any route, but you had to get there through a process of transformation. And part of that is going on the journey of lightness and commitment and learning. So at the shadow level, there's a biofeedback loop that keeps you in the victim place, where you're just a victim of your desire cycles, and you're following one after another. And then it leads you to kind of realizing you're not fully committed. You just followed your desire into that relationship or that job or whatever it was. And so you either stay in those cycles, which creates misery, or you begin to work with them and break out of them. And then you find the beauty of committed practices and relationships and activities. And then you feel lighter inside yourself, and you have this wonderful dance. And then finally you get to this heightened state of transcendence. And those heightened states I describe in the book, but they're, in a way, our future consciousness, I would say, as a species, because most people may have tapped them occasionally or maybe in a plant medicine journey or in some extreme event, or if you're lucky, like me, you have one of those mystic experiences or a Flash, and then you touch into those higher states, or perhaps you're with a great teacher, and you feel it in their presence.

[01:24:47.950] - Speaker 2
Rapture is not something that very many people know about in the modern world, but it exists as one of our kind of higher codings. And so the whole nature of gene keys is showing us what's hidden in our dna, what's latent, that there's a future evolution waiting for us that we haven't yet untapped, we haven't tapped it yet.

[01:25:12.490] - Speaker 1
Also in the 29th is codon ring, the ring of union 4729 and 59. What is that?

[01:25:21.020] - Speaker 2
This is definitely for the nerds, Jinky. Nerds. Well, there's patterns within patterns, and some of them I haven't taught yet. And this is one of the ones I've not taught yet. I've not shared it. I've contemplated it myself. But if you look through the keys, they naturally form clusters that relate to. There are 21 of them, 22, 22, 21. It depends on how you look at it. And they form families, and they relate to kind of almost genetic families, and they may relate to our amino acids because there's 21 or 22 of those. And so it's a kind of pattern I haven't fully unlocked yet, but that I'm contemplating, and my understanding of it is what it shows us is it shows us the machinery of karma. So it shows us how we are moved in groups, how we as a species are evolving in genetic groupings through races and gene pools, and how the machinery that the Ancients call karma is underneath all of that. So there's this incredible web under the surface of life, the dharma, everyone on the surface that we call it the dharma, which is our destiny. But underneath, you know, that old, wonderful old woodcut with the man peering behind the curtain of the global, and he's looking behind, and there's all this machinery behind.

[01:26:52.360] - Speaker 2
It's like a medieval woodcut. It's quite famous. I can't remember who it's by. But anyway, under the surface, there's all this machinery. And the codon rings are kind of. They are how we are moved as whole groupings. So that what they do is they show us a level of orchestration that is underneath normal. If you drop into a heightened state, you see that, you know that it's part of the faith or the trust look like everything's working perfectly according to how it's even terrible things are part of the underlying tapestry that's being woven by human consciousness. Shadow is part of it. So the codon rings show us more collective fields and wound patterns.

[01:27:39.730] - Speaker 1
I love that you've included them, even though, as you've said, you're still contemplating them. You're not all the way there yet. No, but you see the architecture, you recognize that it's there. And by including it in the book, it invites others to participate in that unfolding. Yeah, it's beautiful.

[01:27:56.300] - Speaker 2
Exactly. People always ask me about them, when are you going to do that? For years they've been asking, when are you going to do that? I sort of like when it happens. It's a big piece. It feels like I'm going to have to get there somehow. Yeah.

[01:28:10.270] - Speaker 1
And the sacral plexus, the physiology. Physiology.

[01:28:15.810] - Speaker 2
I put these in. These were a little bit from the human design kind of revelation. And again, I put them in so that the gene keys had a relationship in the body, in the physiology? In the body. And I don't really understand them either, but they kind of.

[01:28:33.960] - Speaker 1
But those relationships are there.

[01:28:35.740] - Speaker 2
They're further contemplations. I think maybe in the future people will. Body workers and people will be able to kind of work with these keys in unique ways. So I put them in there, and.

[01:28:46.670] - Speaker 1
Then there's an amino acid.

[01:28:48.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and there's amino acid. So people like Zach Bush, for example, who I've been recently doing some work with, know he'd love to create some of the amino acid profiles so that we could try them out on people with their gene keys and see what kind of effects it has. So that was interesting. Again, I put them in there so that those conversations would happen long after I'm gone.

[01:29:13.090] - Speaker 1
Yeah. How do you think contemplation works?

[01:29:16.470] - Speaker 2
It's a spontaneous process. We create the space, we create the field, we create the pause. And I describe in the book here three stages that I noticed, and I love threes. So everything in my work is about threes. And the first is pausing, which I've discussed already. Like, you create the space and then your contemplation inhabits that space in some way. Depends on what you're doing or not doing. And then the second stage, which is the transformational stage, is called pivoting. Pivoting. And pivoting is when a breakthrough happens. So something occurs in a pause where you see something different in a new way or you see a pattern of yours in that pause. So you kind of break the momentum of a difficult pattern in your life or a shadow pattern or a victim pattern because you've paused. It's like you take a deep breath and you realize you haven't been breathing until you take that deep breath. And that breath is the pause that then changes the pattern. And then you start breathing more deeply after that. And the same in our everyday life, you create the pauses. And in some of those pauses, a pivotal experience occurs, a breakthrough occurs.

[01:30:43.320] - Speaker 2
It's spontaneous. It can't be predicted. You have to create the pauses. Otherwise the pivots don't happen. You may have a thousand pauses and only one pivot, and you can't predict when it'll happen. But when it happens, you really know it. So something occurs inside you. It can be subtle and creep up on you, and then suddenly you realize it. Or because it's crept into all those pauses. Or it's an instant epiphany and you find yourself in tears or laughing or having a panic attack or something that pushes you out of a state into another state. Right? When I say panic attack, it doesn't mean like, contemplation causes panic attacks, but what it might do is push something out so that you can see it more clearly. And if you create the space of the pause. The only safe place is space, is where you don't have an expectation of yourself or anything. You can just allow anything to occur in those pauses. Right? That's the beauty of the contemplative state, is anything can emerge. And it wants to come up from the unconscious. Things want to come up. Things that we've repressed, perhaps traumas, perhaps from childhood, perhaps from past lives.

[01:32:04.840] - Speaker 2
If you go into those kind of things and they want to kind of come out because they're waiting to be transformed. So the pivot is where those breakthroughs occur. And then the third phase I call merging. This is a beautiful phase, and it's less defined. And it comes about as we have more of those pivots. So if you have two or three pivoting experiences in a year, then you experience a more merged field. So the merging is what happens. The pattern has been burnt from our DNA. A pattern has been burnt white hot out of our DNA. Like a shadow pattern. A victim pattern has gone, and it will never return. Like an addiction, for example. We all have a lot of addictive tendencies. So if you create those pauses around your addiction, you might carry on with your addiction. But slowly, slowly, one of those pivotal experiences is going to occur. And one day you're going to say, I'm stopping that, or I'm going to find help, or I'm going to ask for help. That can be a pivotal experience. And then the moment that happens, you reset the track. And then you follow that pivot where it leads.

[01:33:33.040] - Speaker 2
And eventually it leads to emerging experience, where it's gone. The addiction has been transferred to a higher level. A thing with addiction is you don't really get rid of it. You transfer it to a higher level. It's the same with these shadows. You don't really get rid of them. You transfer them to higher frequencies. They're a higher frequency functioning of our DNA. So we can't pull them out. We have to burn them. And then they become like phoenixes. They become something higher, if that makes sense, yes. So the merging is a beautiful, subtle experience. Where we gradually return to our source, to the cosmic consciousness. So contemplation done over a lifetime, starts to kind of give you a merged experience with existence. That experience I had at the beginning where I was merged. Some of us have had those experiences. But contemplation lowers us into that state very gently. It's a very, very gentle practice. That's why I love it. It's not intense. It can be intense. The pivoting experiences can be very intense, but in itself, it's very subtle, it's very background. But creating those pauses, actually is all you have to do. It's all you have to know.

[01:34:56.310] - Speaker 2
But I lay out in the book those three phases. I call them also insight, breakthrough, epiphany. Those are the three kind of signposts. Like an insight is something that occurs through the mind, like that mind of light. Suddenly you understand something mentally that you didn't.

[01:35:12.860] - Speaker 1
That's the thing about epiphanies. I'm only coming to realize this now. Listening to you speak, that an epiphany is not really a discovery. It's a recognition of something that is. It's just being able to see something that is, that you couldn't see before.

[01:35:26.890] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. A breakthrough is, I see it as an emotional kind of realm where something emotionally has to move through. And then the epiphany, which is a deeper. It connects more to the merging is a physical. It's when something is a pattern is physically transformed. You remember I said earlier that the physical body takes the longest, the merging takes the longest, because this is the coarsest matter. So for patterns to actually change at a fundamental physical level, it's like we have to have an epiphany. And epiphany makes it sound like it's something mental, but it'll be a physical experience. You may sweat, you may go through a diet change. Something occurs in your body, a response where you have to shake off the pattern. And sometimes it could be intense. Tears. I've seen epiphanies in people. Sometimes I've seen a woman break down in one of my contemplative courses, and just seeing her wracked by kind of shaking sometimes it's not always like that. It can be very subtle, but sometimes it is very physical. Often the most common thing is tears. And they can be tears of joy or awe, or they can be tears of grief.

[01:36:58.460] - Speaker 2
But tears almost always come with an epiphany.

[01:37:02.020] - Speaker 1
Where do you see the line between science and spirituality?

[01:37:07.130] - Speaker 2
I think it's coming closer, particularly, as I said earlier, like when scientists begin to kind of reach the limits of paradox and realize that there's a place where these two things kind of kiss each other. I wonder sometimes whether science will kind of surrender at a certain stage and maybe thousands of years from now, where we've got everything we want, we've got all we need, in terms of, there's a part of our brain that, the left brain that has to know how everything works. But I wonder whether at some point, even an evolved scientist might come. There are many of them, right? And they come to that place where often in their later life, where they start to kind of drop more into that imagination, where they go into the mystic because they realize they're not going to get there with the logical bits and pieces mind. And I think also there's a place where the mystical side, as it incorporates more, it can't push away the scientific, as it incorporates more of that which it feels like is happening more. Gene Keys is an attempt, I guess it's my attempt to bring those two together, but I'm not a scientist.

[01:38:31.920] - Speaker 2
So through the genkis, you get a poet. Mystics view through DNA. Yes, it's a poet's view through DNA, but why not? DNA is beautiful, scientific thing. Let's have musicians do that. Let's have poets do that. Let's have all these different people come together with different skills and look through the same lenses. That seems to be where I hope things are going, because I think only when you look through multiple lenses rather than people who are too specialized, do you see the truth. You begin to grasp it. Would you agree with that?

[01:39:10.630] - Speaker 1
Yes, absolutely. How much of your worldview comes from something learned versus something intuited?

[01:39:20.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's mostly intuited. The learned stuff is just the kind of storyline, the narrative, the deeper stuff is intuited. In my morning contemplation, as you know, I love tea, and I sit with my little tea in the morning, my little chinese teas, and I contemplate for, like, an hour. And in those morning contemplations, usually before dawn, in the gloom, as the light's coming, my intuition is just at its peak, what the ancients call the yi, the wisdom mind. There's always, like, ten minutes of throwing stuff out of just clutter. You wake up and there's clutter. And so I just let the clutter leave, and then I kind of start entering into. And the tea helps, actually, because it helps kind of propel you a little bit quicker. And then you go into this wisdom mind, and I just wait. Sometimes in that state, and I get profound intuitions about stuff. Sometimes it's universal, sometimes it's quite emotional, but just deep things that I kind of remember or are revelations. And sometimes I often just let them go. I just let them pass through.

[01:40:36.220] - Speaker 1
Do you ever take notes?

[01:40:37.810] - Speaker 2
Sometimes I'm quite playful now because it's like a state I can enter quite easily. So I sometimes just go, I think. I sometimes think, oh, there's a whole book in that. I have a big revelation. I like, oh, my God, I need to capture that. But then there's a part of me that just goes, nah, someone else will get it. And occasionally I do. Occasionally I go, I'm definitely going to make a podcast around that, because I just can't resist. But, yeah, deep things. Like, recently, I was thinking about the sun and stars and my intuition, because there's this question in science of, like, where do they get their fuel from? And my intuition is that they draw their fuel from the void around them. That's my intuition. Everything that is burning or on fire is drawing its energy from whatever they call it. Dark energy, dark matter. It's drawing it from the void around it, because that's how it is for me when I'm in this deep state. Like, the wisdom comes from nothing. It just comes out of nowhere, and then it surges up. And I haven't consciously done anything. And I think that I see that how the universe works is that one pole draws from the opposite.

[01:42:02.870] - Speaker 2
So I think that a really good scientist follows their intuition. They have intuitions like that. And in the Jinkies book, I put a rather rascally idea. At some point, I said, the new science may be not founded on doubt. It may be founded on certainty. So doubt is when you don't know how something, and you build up a storyline and you check this and try that, and it's like a long ladder to get to understanding and then maybe truth, but the other way is you have a cellular certainty, and then you set out to prove it, because I know this is correct. So maybe you could save quite a lot of time with that approach. So I don't know. There must be scientists that do that. They follow their hunches.

[01:42:51.120] - Speaker 1
I'm sure there are.

[01:42:51.920] - Speaker 2
And just think, I feel this to be true.

[01:42:54.510] - Speaker 1
I'm sure everything starts with an idea, and then you work from there.

[01:42:59.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:43:00.190] - Speaker 1
When did your relationship to the tea ceremony first begin?

[01:43:04.990] - Speaker 2
One of the guys I work with, Elijah, his name is, he is a kind of tea monk. And so he learned from his teacher, who's a great guy called Poe, who lives in Portland. And Poe's studied tea for, like, 30 years. But is this real character? He's a jewish guy from New Jersey, but with a real kind of great sense of humor. But he's absorbed in all the different tea traditions and I guess built up a kind of reservoir of knowledge. And he's quite respected in the tea world as well. But he's a kind of maverick tea Master. So he doesn't follow any of the rules of the traditional schools. And he serves love from love. That's what it's all about. And so he's just himself and he doesn't bother about all the perfect kind of ways of pouring. And then he's learned all that and forgotten it all. So I'm kind of of his lineage in a way, where it's very, very informal.

[01:44:15.730] - Speaker 1
How much do we know about the formal tea ceremonies from history?

[01:44:19.990] - Speaker 2
Quite a lot. Not so much. Well, the Chinese have had less of a ceremony than the Japanese. The Japanese took it and then it went through Zen. And so because it got kind of put through the lens of Zen, everything became deeply structured and aiming at perfection and exquisiteness. Whereas the chinese way of tea is a little more informal. It was more about gathering together, chatting, doing business, deals, trading, sharing, laughing, and is more familial in that way. And so I think our tradition is more in that vein. It's more about just drinking really delicious teas and sitting in the field of their energetics together and seeing what they do to a conversation like a tea like this, that we're having quite a rare tea. This is a 90 year old tea, so has serious age. And it's an oolong, which you wouldn't normally age. But some of these teas are just incredible.

[01:45:29.690] - Speaker 1
How long does it steep for these ones?

[01:45:32.700] - Speaker 2
They're different depending on the tea, but oolongs, you don't want to do too long.

[01:45:36.290] - Speaker 1
How important is the temperature of the water?

[01:45:38.830] - Speaker 2
And the temperature for an oolong is cooler than the temperature for a poo air? Poo air teas are more fermented, darker. I would drink them more in the mornings. Some people have them in evenings, but they're strong. They're kind of a little bit over towards coffee, but they're not. They're nothing like coffee, but they have an impact. They're black and dark and forest floor notes and mushroomy, some of them, and very grounding, whereas oolongs are more heart teas. Part of the sort of ceremony of it is just looking at the shapes and the swirls and the steam and isn't that beautiful?

[01:46:23.870] - Speaker 1
Beautiful. So there's a swirling.

[01:46:26.250] - Speaker 2
These are the oils in the tea and a very good quality tea. The oils get released and they form these. Beautiful. Almost universal.

[01:46:36.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah, very beautiful.

[01:46:39.410] - Speaker 2
And so drinking tea in a beautiful location at the right time of day with great company becomes a sort of a contemplative practice in its own right. So sometimes you would serve tea in silence and other times you might put music on, you might use a little bit of incense, you might just chat and have a dialog. It's basically just tea. So what I learned from Poe is just serve it with love and drink it with love and let the tea do the rest. So, yeah, enjoy your 90 year old.

[01:47:25.750] - Speaker 1
Oolong and see we begin.

[01:47:28.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Without any formality. Cheers. It's lovely to be here and really get a good smell of it as well.

[01:47:41.270] - Speaker 1
Woody.

[01:47:45.030] - Speaker 2
But all kinds of layers and notes from the age. And the other thing about these teasers, as you drink them, as you keep steeping them, they change. So the initial first sips, the first pot that you drink, some people throw it away, actually, because it's like you're flushing the age off the tea and then you start fresh. Actually, I quite like drinking the first one because even though it has a bit of. Might have a bit of dust on it, it's just part of the experience. And so their tradition is that you kind of drink. I think we did this before you drink up the chakras. With each pot, there's these beautiful taoist or zen chinese writings by tea masters talking about the seven layers of tea and the seven pots. So, yeah, it's a beautiful metaphor, really. But, yeah, the tea develops as you drink it. And oolongs you tend to sip because they're heart based tea. They're lighter in color. They're lighter, but they're quite elevating because this has so much age on it. I think it has wisdom in it.

[01:49:06.770] - Speaker 1
Where do you find it, a 90 year old tea?

[01:49:10.130] - Speaker 2
It's not easy. You enter into the tea world, the wild tea world, not just shops and online places, you can't get this kind of tea.

[01:49:22.150] - Speaker 1
So it's like a black. It's a club of sorts.

[01:49:23.980] - Speaker 2
It's a club, yeah. And once you know people, they will introduce you to people. And then there are collectors, just like there are collectors of wine. And you would pay a lot of money for a tea like this, especially when you know it's provenance and there's a lot of fakes out there. Of course. People going, yeah, this is a 30 year old tea and it's just a fake. I happen to know these are from a man called Hang jia, who has very good provenance. He's from Taiwan tea master.

[01:49:53.950] - Speaker 1
And we know if the tea is from Taiwan or this is from Taiwan. From Taiwan.

[01:49:58.460] - Speaker 2
It's an oolong from Taiwan. But it's not often you're drinking oolong of this age. It's extraordinary.

[01:50:04.750] - Speaker 1
Can you tell the difference from the tastes of the teas where they're from to the different provinces have tastes?

[01:50:12.150] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean it's like wine. There are so many different types. It's all one tea though. It's all one same leaf. The same leaf, yeah.

[01:50:22.650] - Speaker 1
But the conditions of the different places change it.

[01:50:25.740] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And how they're handled, how it's been processed, how it's been cared for, how it's been stored, where it's been. Know in the tea world, people will taste a tea and they can tell you instantly. A good tea person will tell you instantly if it's been stored in Hong Kong, for example. Because people would deliberately store some teas in Hong Kong where it's damp and hot. And the damp kind of increases the fermentation a little bit and it gives it a certain know which is very different from if it's been stored in mainland China somewhere, know in their mountains. And a lot of teas are stored in Hong Kong.

[01:51:05.600] - Speaker 1
And what's the process from the time that the leaves are picked?

[01:51:10.570] - Speaker 2
It depends, again on the tea, and I'm not an expert in this, and it depends on what kind of tea.

[01:51:18.090] - Speaker 1
Typically is it sun dried?

[01:51:20.410] - Speaker 2
Some of them will put it in the sun. They'll give it a little heat to oxidize the leaves would stop it from rusting to going oxidizing. So it just sort of stops it. So they give it, they burnish it in a pan and then they'll start fermenting it in different ways. Depends on oolongs are treated very differently from the poo airs, which are much more processed in terms of fermentation. They're kind of like a pile of compost. They're turned. Other teas are laid out under the stars deliberately to ingest certain energies or the moon, all kinds of ways of doing it. And of course, then there's people that really take care of the land and it's organic. And a lot of these teas, these old ones are wild teas. So they're from tea trees in the mountains that have grown wild. And the aboriginal people go out with the baskets on their backs and they find these old trees and then they pick the leaves, they climb them and they put the leaves in their basket and they bring them back. And so it's from a pure permaculture environment. It's from a wild environment with monkeys and things, the biodiversity, as opposed to most of the tea that's drunk around the world, which is plantation monocrop, monoculture.

[01:52:41.200] - Speaker 2
So very different kinds of teas, these, if you can find them. So you kind of need to be in the cognicenti of the tea world to find these really good teas.

[01:52:54.010] - Speaker 1
So each time you refill the pot and we do seven, well, you can.

[01:53:01.580] - Speaker 2
Do as many as you want, depending on the tea. But, yeah, this will definitely go seven brews. And you'll see, it'll change its color, its depth, its intensity. The second one usually gives you a much stronger kind of, because the tea has woken up. The tea was asleep. It was dormant. 90 years dormant, lying there waiting for this moment. Poe would say, it really has waited for this moment. It's now in full service to you. It's fulfilling its dharma, which I love. I love the way of a sort of magical way of looking at it. So the second one usually gives you a kind of a louder announcing of its true nature.

[01:53:50.170] - Speaker 1
And you do this for yourself every morning?

[01:53:53.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's a private practice and I love sharing it. I have this kind of metaphor that I tell people about that I always have two cups. And I think it's a good sign for just a good allegory of life. Always take two cups with you because you never know who will show up. So even if I'm sitting in the wild somewhere on my own with it.

[01:54:13.650] - Speaker 1
You'Ll have two cups?

[01:54:14.600] - Speaker 2
I'll have two cups. Just in case a stranger walks by and says, what are you doing?

[01:54:19.130] - Speaker 1
Open invitation.

[01:54:20.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:54:22.150] - Speaker 1
So the second round doesn't have the same experience on top of the tea.

[01:54:27.750] - Speaker 2
It might do if you look at it, but there probably will be oils continue to come out if you get the light right. They are still coming out. Yeah. I can see them in my cup.

[01:54:40.830] - Speaker 1
It's much less pronounced than the first round.

[01:54:46.430] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So see how it tastes. Stronger aroma. And so, really, for me, the teaching of tea is all about its energetics. This is why, even if you have a fake tea, if you really listening to the energetics, it might still be a powerful tea. It depends on what it does inside you. And so one of the beauties of tea is drinking tea is that you're invited to go beyond taste. So the taste is a good indicator and the smell, but you're asked to really go deeper and do, what is this tea doing inside you?

[01:55:32.510] - Speaker 1
The drinker is participating with the tea.

[01:55:35.650] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And I think that's what makes it a beautiful sense of communion. And sometimes when I'm sitting with friends and we're drinking tea and we'll say, so what do you feel? And everyone will describe a different feeling, usually in the body, but say, I feel it here or I feel an opening here. And sometimes you can close your eyes and see if you know it's a plant medicine. After all, it's a plant medicine that you can ingest daily, but different from unlike kind of most plant medicines. It's very integrating into your everyday life. So you can drink it. Often.

[01:56:18.570] - Speaker 1
I tend to slurp it with it.

[01:56:21.310] - Speaker 2
The chinese love slurping, but still, it's interesting to drink a tea that's that old, older than either of us.

[01:56:32.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:56:34.450] - Speaker 2
Something alive in our systems of that age. Very good for the microbiome as well. Do you feel anything?

[01:56:46.630] - Speaker 1
I feel it in my upper chest.

[01:56:49.590] - Speaker 2
Me too. Like a vibration or a fluttering.

[01:56:57.930] - Speaker 1
Do you find your relationship to drinking tea changes over time?

[01:57:05.850] - Speaker 2
I think like anything, it's like any meditation practice or something, it just gets deeper. You find layers and refinements, especially as you drink more tea and wider varieties. Because a tea enthusiast like me, I'll drink many different teas. I'm always interested. It's like looking for the Grail you're looking for.

[01:57:30.660] - Speaker 1
But is the goal looking for the one you most love, or is it the variety that's interesting?

[01:57:36.870] - Speaker 2
It's the variety that's interesting. For instance, I have a tea that I found online in a chinese website. It was from 1968, and it was a block that was made in the cultural revolution, when the individualizing of tea was taken away from the Chinese. And it was all just suddenly there were rules of, this is how you make tea. And suddenly there was this imposition of control over the tea as there was over the people. And so I wondered about that tea, and I thought, wow, I bet that tea tastes disgusting because it's a mono tea. No one has put their own flavor or stamp on it. It's all been homogenized. But it was the only thing that the people were drinking, so they must have actually leaned on it heavily during difficult times when they're out in the fields, they all drank this tea. So I thought that teas are going to really put me in touch with the kind of wounding of those times, the loss of freedom, but also it's going to put me in touch with ordinary people who just were suffering in the fields. And they drank this tea together and they probably drew enjoyment from it.

[01:58:52.620] - Speaker 2
So when I tasted it, and it was pretty inharmonious, but I also got a lot of love out of it. So even though technically or structurally, it's not a well made tea, as you'd expect, because it's homogenized. There was a lot of love in it, and it's almost like it contained the people, people's hearts. Probably one of the few breaks they had during difficult times. So, yeah, tea, it's about the diversity. And sometimes I will drink teas and I think that's really not nice. And I usually won't go on drinking it, because I just think, like, life's too short to drink tea. That actually really is revolting. And I'll just throw it and I'll just try another tea. And sometimes there are mornings like that. This is one of those mornings where tea is just not working for me.

[01:59:44.280] - Speaker 1
If you find one that you like, is it usually in supply where you can keep getting it or not necessarily?

[01:59:50.250] - Speaker 2
Not necessarily. And that's the beauty of it. Like, some of the very best teas, I'll say to my teacher Poe, have you got any more of this? And he'll say, that's, know, this is the last kilo, and we'll drink it together. And it's just like, that's it. And it's a fabulous tea. And that's it. It's gone.

[02:00:08.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's the impermanence.

[02:00:10.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Which I love about tea. And, I mean, just recently, I discovered a tea that, by fortune, that was one of the most delicious teas I ever drunk. And I found that there was quite a fairly large amount of it available. And so I invested in some. But that doesn't often happen that you can actually get for a decent amount, because, like, fine wine, some of the prices in China are, like, off the charts. Tens of thousands of dollars for a brick of tea because of the collectors in, you know, at the same time, what po, my teacher, will say, know, a lipton's tea bag or a Tetley tea bag, that's just bog's standard, everyday tea. You can get just as much love out of it.

[02:01:02.040] - Speaker 1
It's full as much about the ritual as it is the leaf.

[02:01:06.230] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Ultimately, it's about the love you put in and the sharing, the sense of communion. But there's an esthetic to the process. So I think people that become attuned to very fine wines because they developed their palate and their olfactory capacities to a fine degree and they refined it. It's the same with tea. If you really are listening deeply, you can take such joy from exploring the world of tea. And then you collect, like, I have a library of teas that I've collected, and then you intuitively, each morning, or whoever's there, you choose the tea that suits the know. I had with me here today, I only had five teas, but I knew that we'd be drinking this one. It was like it stood up in front of me and went, you need to drink me with Rick. It may not be the best one, but it was just the right one. Yes. And certainly the oldest.

[02:02:17.130] - Speaker 1
No. It's interesting how that. How the wisdom of the tea, it's inherent in it. It tells you exactly.

[02:02:27.480] - Speaker 2
That's exactly it. It's the teacher. It's a plant. If you go into the world of plant medicine, if you happen to take ayahuasca or try those kind of things, the indigenous people will call it. This is grandmother or grandfather, if it's one of the others. And it has a wisdom of its own. It has a spirit, actually. And tea has a spirit. All tea has that spirit in it. And I think in the case of tea, it's deep compassion. I would say that's its flavor. It's here to serve. And all over the world, it's the second most widely drunk liquid after water. So all over the world, people pause and drink tea. It's different from coffee, which is another world, but tea is really about pausing. It's really about sitting together.

[02:03:27.750] - Speaker 1
Did you grow up with tea in England as well?

[02:03:31.030] - Speaker 2
Not to this degree. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Tea time. Yeah. Which was always a very enjoyable time of day because you sat down with your parents? Well, I did when they were there. That was the only time. I mean, maybe at breakfast occasionally, but that would be a time my father would be. He loved his tea, so he would come and sit down, you'd have your tea and your biscuit.

[02:03:55.450] - Speaker 1
And was it at four in the afternoon?

[02:03:57.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah, something like that. Habas four, yeah.

[02:04:00.510] - Speaker 1
Is this the third?

[02:04:01.790] - Speaker 2
Third, yeah. I mean, I consider myself a novice with tea, really, compared to others I know. Been recently reading about this guy called Baisao, who was a Zen tea master in Kyoto in the 18th century. And it's just a beautiful book that was written about him and his life. And he left fragments of poetry that he wrote. And he went through the Zen trainings in his youth and excelled to quite a high level. And then packed it all in and went and became a tea seller, which wasn't done. But he excelled in serving tea. And he would wander around the kind of valleys of Kyoto and the forests and he would serve up tea near the temples to passers by. And they'd come and slowly, slowly he became infamous because people would go and have tea with him and they would have profound experiences because of his presence and the way that he handled the tea and the way he held presence and served them. So a lot of his tea law that has Zen all the way through it is about. I mean, I wish I had some of his things to read here down, but it's about literally what I said about my teacher poe.

[02:05:30.750] - Speaker 2
It's love in a teacup. He put love in a cup. He put truth in a cup by sou because of how he served it. He would say that people who were exhausted by their lives would come and sit and have tea with him and feel completely reinvigorated at every level of their being and leave kind of reborn. And so he became this old mendicant kind of guy, and he started a whole tradition of the people started to copy him. And then there were, like, people that left the temples and became beggar booksellers and beggar all kinds of. It became a whole tradition that he spawned of the kind of wandering beggar salesman. Yeah, I kind of like that idea.

[02:06:24.670] - Speaker 1
It's definitely changing.

[02:06:28.670] - Speaker 2
How'd you find that one?

[02:06:31.310] - Speaker 1
I don't have the language to explain it. I feel like language often is. There's not enough of it for the emotions and the feelings and the flavors that come up, and I don't feel that one in the chest in the same way. But I'm also thinking about it being the third cup and focusing on the lower solar plexus, would you say?

[02:06:58.170] - Speaker 2
Yeah. For me, I feel it more, almost like it's left my body a bit. I don't know. It's out here a bit more, but, yeah, if I were to give it a place, it's dropped down. I actually can hear it in my voice, which I think has dropped down in pitch a little bit.

[02:07:19.710] - Speaker 1
What are the other practices that you've found that either pull you deeper into yourself or push you further out of yourself?

[02:07:32.050] - Speaker 2
I use all kinds of occasions and things. I find walking an amazing, contemplative thing to do. I'm more of a walker than I am a Sitter. I would say. There's a lovely quote from St. Augustine's Solvitur Ambulando. Do you ever heard that by walking, it is solved?

[02:08:02.130] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[02:08:02.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So walking is one of my favorite things. I also run a little bit, which I also find very contemplative. But I'm a non competitive runner, as in, I don't run for health. I run because I like the space and I like the rhythm, and I don't want to run with anyone. People often ask me, you want to come for a run with me? Can I come with you? I want to be alone. I want to just be in the rhythm of the run. And I don't run particularly fast. I kind of roll along a bit and through the countryside where I live, and it's quite hilly and the scenery changes and it's beautiful just to be out in the same with walking, just to be out with the breeze and the rain or the wind or the smells of nature. But, yeah, certainly being in nature is one of the big things. One of my favorite things is to be near the river where I live. I'm a river lover. River dart. This is the most favorite place in the world for me. The river dart valley. It's like a pure, pure valley, untouched by humanity.

[02:09:27.270] - Speaker 2
Old mossy oak trees, lots of lichens. You could be totally alone. Yeah, it's beautiful, wild english river. I don't know, ones that take me out of myself, whether it wouldn't be practices, but anything where I forget to breathe. Yeah, I have a family. I'm a family man. And I notice certain times of the day where pressure kind of builds, usually sort of in the evening before supper time, where the people are tired, my wife's tired, I'm getting tired. There's a meal to be made. Daughter's arrived home, she's tired. There's a kind of crunch time where I can easily lose my center, but I know that that time, I don't give myself a hard time anymore if I do kind of lose my center. And sometimes I might just snap out or something, and I'm like, damn. Sorry. Yeah, it's human. Yeah, those moments. This tea, by the way, is called inner master. I think there's always layers of mastery, layer upon layer. It's like the infinity we were talking about earlier, the fourth pour. Yeah. I wish I had another cup. I'd do something here. Enjoys.

[02:11:26.100] - Speaker 1
It's getting hotter.

[02:11:27.950] - Speaker 2
That one is quite hot.

[02:11:31.150] - Speaker 1
Burning my fingers. It's funny. Same cup, same water.

[02:11:36.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah. We can let it sit for a little while. I think it's in its prime now.

[02:11:48.310] - Speaker 1
Have you ever learned anything about reading tea leaves?

[02:11:50.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's where the tradition comes from, doesn't. Yeah, not so much with oolongs, but with some of the deep poo airs where the fragments just. And it depends on your pot. The fragments kind of come out. Yeah. I think. I mean, you enter this field of kind of transcendence a little bit after the 7th cup, and that's when it was a traditional, maybe to look at the tea leaves and through that mind's eye say what you see.

[02:12:22.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's funny because I think of the practice of reading the tea leaves, about the tea leaves, but it really is the whole journey leading up to the reading that really sets the stage to allow it to happen.

[02:12:35.840] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yeah. It's funny how these kind of things like that just get woven into our lives without us realizing where they crept in. I was sitting on a beach a few years ago, drinking an amazing tea that someone, a friend had given me. And the tide was coming in, and I did the full seven cups, just sitting there for an hour and longer. And after the 7th cup, because I was alone, I was just holding it there, and I was just looking at the 7th cup before I'd drunk it. And these words came into my head. It's all just a storm in a teacup. And I realized that expression, storm in a teacup, like, where has that come from? But I totally got the joke because I was in that state where the entire universe was in my teacup. And I realized that we make so much fuss about our lives, our tiny lives, and I'd been looking around me and seeing all the tiny lichens and little creatures all around, and I sort of realized how small I was. It was a beautiful moment. I started to laugh out loud, actually, at the joke.

[02:13:58.430] - Speaker 2
Tea. Epiphanies. Tiphanies.

[02:14:04.850] - Speaker 1
It's really getting good. When did you first fall in love with poetry?

[02:14:12.130] - Speaker 2
I think Wordsworth turned me on to know William Wordsworth, english romantic poet. Reading his works at school, probably. I mean, I studied Shakespeare and things before that, but, like, we all did at kind of those school. Well, not all of us, but some of us, but Wordsworth kind of. He was a nature poet, and his poetry is very accessible. And I just fell in love with the kind of aura that he created in his poetry and kind of loved his name as well, I think. Isn't that a cool name for a poet? And I think I started experimenting myself in my kind of late teens.

[02:15:01.240] - Speaker 1
Did anyone read to you as a child?

[02:15:03.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah, my mom and dad read to me a little bit. I mean, not overly. Yeah. I love the sound of words. I was also lazy at school, but I didn't want to read the novels. Can't we just do the poems? They're really short.

[02:15:22.570] - Speaker 1
They also say a lot in a very concise, fewest amount of words. And they say much more often than the long tomes.

[02:15:31.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I think sometimes people mistake poetry for the ability to write poems, whereas for me, poetry is about living poetically. So even if you never have written a poem, you might be one of the most poetic people because of the way you're living. So it's more of a way of life. And a poem is just a represent. It's just a symbol. Like you said, it's about distilling beauty and truth into a small space. If you can do that, you have the heart of a poet. Whether you do it through music, whether you do it through your business, whether you do anything, sport, anything, you can distill down to, like, mastery, it's poetic. So, yeah, for me, it's not about poems. One of my favorite writers, who I discovered I love to share, is a hungarian writer called Hamvash Bella. I ever mentioned him to you before?

[02:16:34.720] - Speaker 1
I don't think so.

[02:16:36.130] - Speaker 2
B-E-L-A. He's not been translated much into English, but there is some stuff online, and some of it's not very well translated. But he's such a free thinker. He died in about the think. He's kind of Hungary's Shakespeare, but he didn't write plays. What he did is he mastered the essay, the short kind of prose essay, but he wrote with such poetic insight. And he's sometimes devilish in his. I don't know, his turn of phrase, his metaphor. There's no other writer I've ever come across like his that thinks or writes like him. He's completely unique and has this beautiful esthetic sense of life in the cosmos. And you can tell he was vastly widely read and fascinated by the mysteries, and had read Qing and the Bible and the Tao de Qing, and every mystical book known, and had an incredible memory as well. One of those amazing people. And then because of what happened in Hungary with know communism, he was put to work in a factory. So a lot of his life was just spent as a factory worker, this completely know life. And a lot of his works were lost or burned, his master works, but still quite a bit remains.

[02:18:09.590] - Speaker 2
But as I said, a lot of it's not translated. I actually found a hungarian friend and a housewife and a single mother, say, and I paid her to translate his works for me. His main sacred work is called sienta sacra, sacred science. Never been translated into English, three volumes. And so she translated it for me, roughly, kind of crudely, but well. And so it was this incredibly exciting feeling of reading, being the first english person ever to read this master work of mystic wisdom that tracked from the very beginning of human thinking to upright, up to date now. And a lot of his insights have kind of. I've used into some of my work.

[02:19:01.200] - Speaker 1
I'd love to read it.

[02:19:02.780] - Speaker 2
But one of his beautiful pieces that's translated very well is called a philosophy of wine. And it's a sort of 80 page essay about wine, but he uses wine as a metaphor. But it's exquisite. It's really beautiful. And he talks about. He obviously was a lover of wine. He was a lover of everything fine. He talks about you had to drink a certain wine on a certain time of year, but only if a woman was coming and she had to be under 50. And then you drink this wine. If she was over 50, you'd drink this wine and then you had to have it in these cups at that time of year. You couldn't have it have glasses and then everything. So he had refined down every single kind of like a formula. And he goes into the kind of, what does he call it? Something like the matrix of the mouth, mouth harmonics. And he explores mouth harmonics and he talks about what the mouth really is for. And so he names three things. It's talking. The mouth puts out drinking, the mouth takes in kissing, the mouth does both. And so he combines the.

[02:20:27.480] - Speaker 2
Kissing is the highest form of mouth harmonics. And he kind of lays out this beautiful tapestry of thinking around sensuality. And then he describes the zones on a woman in a way that is so beautiful, like the different scents at different places in a woman's body. He's an artist, I would say, of the senses. He took it to its very highest pitch. So I'm a lover of his writings and his works. You could find that philosophy of wine online. It's really worth a read. He has a rant at the communists in it as well. He has a good rant. He calls them the atheists. Yeah, but it's very amusing and very, very sharp. I mean, you would not want to be on the other side of this man number five.

[02:21:26.830] - Speaker 1
And you started writing poetry soon after reading wordsworthy.

[02:21:31.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I guess I had a few kind of early attempts that were not particularly good. And then I think I just. Jared Manley Hopkins was amazing. I don't know if you heard his writing. He creates images, but it's all about the sounds. So he just creates beautiful sounds so you could listen to it if you didn't understand English. And it sounds so flowing, beautiful, musical, lyrical. And so I kind of took a lot of inspiration from him. And when I started to write, I started to hear the sounds of words following each other, flowing into each other. And I think I brought that into my.

[02:22:13.280] - Speaker 1
Do you read your work out loud when you're writing it?

[02:22:16.340] - Speaker 2
No, I hear it.

[02:22:17.900] - Speaker 1
It's very occasional as you're writing it.

[02:22:19.630] - Speaker 2
I hear it and I hear what's coming next. And if I read it back, sometimes I'll be like, that doesn't work, that doesn't fit. That sentence is too long or too short, or there's a repetition of a word that didn't quite work. I've become very sort of specific in my. Yeah, it has to sound right. It's like the tea. It has to kind of be served in the right way.

[02:22:48.470] - Speaker 1
I think what we learn, getting deep into anything is that same appreciation in detail. It applies to everything. It applies to everything we do.

[02:23:00.910] - Speaker 2
For me, even the set, you know, the sound is even more important than the meaning in a way, because the sound kind of conveys the frequency of the meaning as opposed to. Do you know what I mean? It's the gaps that are part of the words as well. So if you don't get the gaps in the right places, the pauses, it doesn't hold the frequency of the truth that you're trying to convey. You don't want to get caught in trying to make the words bring the meaning, if you know what I mean.

[02:23:39.550] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[02:23:40.170] - Speaker 2
The meaning comes between the words. Yes.

[02:23:44.080] - Speaker 1
And the work is being done by the sound current.

[02:23:48.250] - Speaker 2
That's a nice way of putting it.

[02:23:49.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I know. I learned TM when I was young, and in TM, you get a mantra given to you, but you're not told what the mantra means. And I don't know if it has a meaning. It's more about the sound current and repeating the sound current internally.

[02:24:06.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's funny we're talking about sound currents on the fifth cup.

[02:24:14.610] - Speaker 1
Throat. Funny how that happens. Coincidence, I would think if I was drinking seven cups of something unless I knew that seven was the number. I don't think I would count. Like, if I have a pitcher of water and if I'm drinking water through the day, I would never count the number of cups. It's interesting practice to stay aware of the number of cups.

[02:24:48.190] - Speaker 2
It's also nice because you kind of have an ending. It's always nice to kind of feel there's a structure, and I like the.

[02:24:55.990] - Speaker 1
Feeling of bringing it through the body.

[02:24:57.670] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it's about the length of a meditation. It's an hour or something. It's just about enough water.

[02:25:12.870] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the clean space.

[02:25:17.110] - Speaker 2
The clean space. I guess that's a practice we can all do. Isn't it? Having a clean space? It's one of the suggested practices in the back of my book. It's difficult if you have a cluttered space externally, I think it's difficult to then touch in with an uncluttered space internally. So I think there's a relationship there to be contemplated. For me, living in a family where kids are coming and going and dropping stuff all over the place, I've had to learn not to kind of overly try and control that, because it just becomes a pain. But I do have my space that is a place where I know there's clarity and there's not too much stuff and there's kind of order. And, like, in this room, there's just lovely, clear, clean, white, crisp openness. And I think that's so good for the soul.

[02:26:28.750] - Speaker 1
There's no distractions.

[02:26:30.150] - Speaker 2
Yeah. If you go to, like, look at the artwork from China and Japan and you see it, or music, even, like, a lot of it is emptiness. In fact, there's more emptiness in japanese art than there is content. I think it's like 60 40, something like that. Maybe a bit more in terms of emptiness, there's more emptiness. And same with calligraphy, like big white page, just a few marks on it. There's such a beauty to that. Like, those lingering spaces. And then it really brings a focus to what is there. So I have lived by that philosophy of only have things that are purely functional or very beautiful in your space. Hopefully both at the same time. That's the ultimate. Yeah. So it's really nice thing to do is to clear a space, clear your space, clear someone else's space, help them do that. It's a very therapeutic thing to do. And then having that, there's also a.

[02:27:44.580] - Speaker 1
Sense of accomplishment when you do it. I feel a sense of relief when I tackle a task of organizing something, because it always feels overwhelming in the beginning stages. But that feeling of the peace and balance of cleanliness really feels good.

[02:28:02.850] - Speaker 2
And anything you can bring simplicity to, like if it's a business, for example, how do you simplify a business or a house? Or how do you simplify things? That's such an incredible challenge.

[02:28:20.950] - Speaker 1
I found once you live in an empty space, you become very wary of bringing things into it. It's like when you may be out and about and see something. This is beautiful. I'd love to have this at home. And then you think about it in your empty space, like it's going to take over everything.

[02:28:36.310] - Speaker 2
I know. I think really hard now about taking someone gifts for that reason? Because I'm not sure I want someone to give me a gift. Yes. Because sometimes they're just giving me a problem.

[02:28:53.050] - Speaker 1
Books are good gifts.

[02:28:54.080] - Speaker 2
Books are fine.

[02:28:54.670] - Speaker 1
And books are good to have. Good to have around. I feel good with books around.

[02:28:58.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Because you can put them together on the shelf. But sometimes people, you know, people were sending me books, sending me their books, and I often don't have time to read them, so it's difficult to know what to do with them. I don't want to just put them on my shelf and not read them. Because a few years ago, I edited all my books back down to the essence books, which was a great thing to do. Yes. Yeah. So, yeah, I don't want clutter. It becomes a discipline that and the.

[02:29:28.990] - Speaker 1
Idea that our outside surroundings influence our inner life. So many things come from that. The simple understanding that what's going on outside is going to influence what's going on inside.

[02:29:42.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah. But at the same time there's that you might be married to someone who's just not like that, in which case you have to kind of, if you love them and you're not going to leave them, presumably because they're untidy, you have to expand your own ability to find, to hold that space and even allow. Because I think compassion allows for anything. Right. So it's about even being okay with a little bit of clutter if you can't control it. But, yeah, I think you're really good at simplifying. You have that down really beautifully. I see that.

[02:30:28.920] - Speaker 1
I lived in a house in Los Angeles filled with antiques, and then I got a house at the beach. The beach house was empty and I just ended up never going back to the other house. And I liked the empty house. When I first moved to California, I moved into an empty house and it was great living in an empty house. And then over the years I got some furniture and it was never better than when it was empty.

[02:30:56.230] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Number seven, last one. Yeah. The 6th is really the peak. The 7th is coming back to earth.

[02:31:13.530] - Speaker 1
Closing.

[02:31:14.350] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I've actually had experiences on the 7th cup where it's often just that very. You're back to ordinariness, the spiritual plane has been ascended, and then you're back to chopping wood and carrying water. It changes colors.

[02:31:39.640] - Speaker 1
Quite good. Yeah, it's much lighter.

[02:31:43.250] - Speaker 2
You can taste more of the water, the minerals in the water. So if you have a really good water, that's a key thing in tea, is the water. You had to have good quality water. There's a story about the guy, the master, sending his student off to get the water, to fetch the water, and he tells him to go and get it from the top spring. And it's a long, long walk. This is the tea master. And the guy walks and walks and walks for miles and miles and miles. And then he goes to just below the spring because he doesn't want to. So there's, like, several springs, and he doesn't want to do the last little steep climb, but it's, like, 500 yards further. And he gets it from there, and, of course, he brings it back. And then the master says, you didn't get the right water when he tastes it. You didn't get it from the spring. The sauce. Yeah. Amazing. If you could actually tell that from drinking water. Just water.

[02:32:42.550] - Speaker 1
That was beautiful. Thank you so much for the tea ceremony.

[02:32:46.110] - Speaker 2
It's a real pleasure.

[02:32:47.200] - Speaker 1
I love it.

[02:32:48.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:32:48.780] - Speaker 1
When did 55 come in the series, as they were?

[02:32:53.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think maybe about two thirds through something like that at the time.

[02:32:58.320] - Speaker 1
Did it feel different than the others?

[02:33:00.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah, definitely.

[02:33:03.310] - Speaker 1
What was different?

[02:33:05.070] - Speaker 2
Well, I couldn't come up with a word for the gift, right. So it was the only one. I couldn't find a word. And so the word I had for the city, the highest level, was freedom. Freedom. So I knew it was the key of freedom. And the shadow is the key of victimization. So you have the victim side. So it's kind of a master key of the whole gene keys, really, because they're all about victim states. The shadows and the cities are all about freedom, forms of freedom. So I had to trust my contemplation because it would always locate the word somewhere in the pantheon. And the fact that it didn't, I then contemplated that. So I went into a long contemplation, well, why isn't there one? And then I had this realization that it was the key where change was taking place, so that it was an anomaly. And so, in a way, it was where the gift and where the sort of gift becomes the city. And in a way, it's where we transform first. So it's a place in our genome, it's a place in our dna where the transformation of consciousness begins.

[02:34:31.850] - Speaker 2
And so it's almost like in genetics where everything's written in sequences. It's almost like you splice. The evolutionary current has spliced in a new sequence, and it kind of interrupted an old sequence and spliced in this new mutation. And from that point onwards, everything changes. So it's difficult to explain because I kind of saw it and felt it. So it's from here that all the keys begin to change.

[02:35:05.960] - Speaker 1
Do you know what 55 was in the original Yi Ching?

[02:35:08.930] - Speaker 2
Yeah, often. It's called abundance, actually. So it is that kind of. There's different ways of which people have translated the original term, but it is generally about this kind of explosive flowering of freedom. And so it has that relationship, and its dark side is definitely quite intense because it is that very deep emotional victim energy.

[02:35:41.780] - Speaker 1
Is the valence always the same, that the more powerful the gift is, the darker the shadow is? Is there always a balance like that?

[02:35:50.640] - Speaker 2
I think so. I mean, there's definitely a relationship. The gene keys is. It's like a holographic language. So all the shadows are one thing, they're all the same state, and all the gifts are all the creative transformation of that state in different ways. Like yours, we looked at was the creative process of the word is freshness. So it's this constant freshness finding its way towards beauty. And at the shadow, it's that kind of deep melancholic entropy. That's gene key one. So all the keys are kind of like that. So if you look in one key, you're just reading them all, which is a bit of a joke in a way, because every single key, if you read each one, you're reading the same story over and over and over again.

[02:36:38.530] - Speaker 1
Just from a different aspect.

[02:36:39.800] - Speaker 2
From a different aspect.

[02:36:40.520] - Speaker 1
Different.

[02:36:40.770] - Speaker 2
But this 155, it does tell the story of all the keys, but it also tells a prophecy. It holds a prophecy. That was why I was kind of a bit blown away by it, because it suddenly had this different quality to it. And then as that opened up in me, a whole stream of information, knowledge, wisdom, memory, kind of came through me as I was writing the book, and I was really quite shocked.

[02:37:08.980] - Speaker 1
What does 55 predict?

[02:37:12.750] - Speaker 2
It's about what I call the future human. So I think that the reasoning behind the whole gene keys book and the writings and the teachings are that they're here now at this time, preparing us for something that's coming, a future potential mutation in human beings. And we've mutated in the past or transmuted from one species to another. And our genes do that. They create forks sometimes, and then often an old species withers on the vine and a new one grafted on comes and starts a new kind of phase of evolution. And so that's what I saw, felt, kind of heard, and was filled with from this key and its sort of message. So it concerns that transformation, and it has a beautiful allegory woven into it, which is, you can read in the key it talks about. It's called HeAvenly Hydraulics. And the allegory is the Life cycle of a dragonfly. And it's why, when you look at the gene keys books, you see these dragonflies sitting in them, and it's a symbol. You see it on my name, and you see it because it's kind of the prophetic. Part of the wisdom and the beauty of the life cycle of the dragonfly is it starts its life as a nymph.

[02:38:41.850] - Speaker 2
It lives underwater. It's called a nymph, and it lives for, like, two or three years as an underwater predator. That's its life. And it doesn't know anything other than that. It's kind of lackluster. It feeds on all kinds of things that it finds underwater, other insects and little fish and things. And then one day in its life cycle, something different happens. Usually in the summer or the spring, late spring, it will find a stalk of grass or a reed or something, and it will latch onto it with its legs and it will crawl up it out towards the sun. And it crawls for the first time ever out of the water and sits in the air, clinging to a stalk of grass or a reed. And then this incredible process happens, I should say, actually, before this happens, that there's several stages called molts, where the dragonfly, like a butterfly, goes through internal changes. So it has several of those while it's underwater, which lead to this leaving the water environment and then coming up into the sun. And then what happens is, within a very short space of time, compared to its life cycle, its back starts to split open, and this new creature that's hidden inside it emerges.

[02:40:10.390] - Speaker 2
It has a thorax. It's this incredible big thorax that just pushes out from the old creature that's kind of still clinging to the stalk. And you might kind of sort of think, sometimes I wonder what it thinks, if it could think at that moment, what the hell is going on. Anyway, so the water in it, because it's a water creature, is actually the energy that forces the new creature to open. It's literally a hydraulic process where the water element pushes the thorax and the wings and brings it out of the old creature. And then it's sitting there. It's sitting there kind of drying off, and it sort of waits for a puff of wind and then it's off. And it's this multicolored, iridescent, extraordinary, one of the most aerodynamic, complex hunters that the world in the insect kingdom. It's also, very, very ancient dragonflies were here with the dinosaurs. And so it sort of skips a step in several steps, you could think, because it goes from the water element to the air element. So it's an extraordinary metaphor for consciousness. And that was the metaphor that came through the 55th gene key. That if we are that dragonfly, if we are that lava, that nymph in its underwater stage, and we're in those victim patterns, because we don't know anything else, we can't even imagine the future.

[02:41:51.620] - Speaker 2
It's unimaginable because it's so far from our reality. If you can imagine, the butterfly is a lovely metaphor as well. But in a way, I think these gene keys, the 55th key especially suits the dragonfly because it's this shift from the water element to the air element. And the water element, in a way, is our desire, nature. And it's our desire nature, and our sexuality and our creativity, all that energy, that actually is the thing that's going to transform us. And if you read the book, if you read the 55, it talks about the solar plexus a lot. It's like it's located this change, this mutation, is located in the solar plexus center. And this is something that ra of the human design system also predicted. And so I was aware of this when the jinkies came along and I'd sort of put it to the back of my mind slightly. And then when this dragonfly of the 55th key wrote itself and emerged, I suddenly realized what he'd been talking about. That this center here in us, this solar plexus area that we're now understanding biologically as like an incredible kind of. It's where most of our dna lives, in the bacteria in our gut.

[02:43:11.620] - Speaker 2
80, 90% of our dna is actually bacteria living in our gut.

[02:43:17.250] - Speaker 1
And considered our second brain.

[02:43:19.190] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yeah. But in a way, it's our first brain because it has a higher intelligence at some level than the thinking brain, because it bypasses thought. And also it's instinctive, it's spontaneous. That's why it's the gut. We talk about having a gut feeling. So my understanding is that there's a mutation. And this is, again what Ra said. There'll be a mutation that takes place in the equipment of our solar plexus and that our new awareness will be born from that center. And so in a way, our new awareness is the awareness of these higher states that manifest these cities that are in every gene key. Yeah. So it's entering into miraculous domains. It's entering into that's why it has a prophetic flavor to it. It kind of has to, because it's a quantum leap. It involves a quantum leap. Going from this creature to this creature involves a quantum leap. So the future human is something that we can't quite imagine. It's so far removed from where we are now. But also the prediction, the prophecy is that it will happen quite quickly as the dragonfly. There's been a long, slow build up.

[02:44:44.480] - Speaker 1
It's like a great awakening.

[02:44:45.830] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And then it talks about the great change, which is like, obviously, these times were born in. And I see that quite broadly, like, not.

[02:44:56.720] - Speaker 1
I wonder if these great changes that we go through are related to technology changes, if some new breakthrough in technology changes the way we live, and then through the new way we live, we adapt to this new way and we change.

[02:45:10.170] - Speaker 2
I think it's absolutely, completely involved, because even the birth of the Internet, in a sense, is a kind of precursor of our future awareness, and our future awareness is an Internet. But the mistake sometimes I think, that some people might make is thinking that it's technology that's going to be the part that kind of advances us. Instead of realizing we are the technology, we contain the technology. And the outer technology is a metaphor or a symbol or a reflection or a mirror of what we actually contain inside. And that's why it's kind of manifesting. So what I'm talking about is a networked consciousness, which I think many people also is feeling that that's a potential for us, that humanity, at its next level of evolution could become a networked consciousness, but without the need for external technology, actually a telepathic.

[02:46:19.050] - Speaker 1
I think it's possible that it was more the case and we got away from it with the outer technology, we lost some of our gifts, I think.

[02:46:29.070] - Speaker 2
So, yeah. It was what I also understood from when I wrote the 55th gene key. And some of the stuff I wrote, I kind of read it back to myself after. I just thought, that's really outlandish. Do I really want to be so.

[02:46:42.070] - Speaker 1
Isn'T it fascinating, though, to birth something and then to be able to go back to it and wonder where it came from?

[02:46:49.100] - Speaker 2
It's very unusual, and especially something like that. Sounds prophetic. I was a little bit uncomfortable, to be honest. I still am a bit like, oh, wow. But it felt an integral part of the whole. And it felt like after that key came, suddenly everything took on a new meaning. And the reason for the whole teachings and the wisdom and this new version of the Yi Ching coming, if you like, is to prepare us for this next stage of us crawling up the stalk as a species and not quite knowing what we're going to become. And in a way, you could look at everything that's happening around us as part of that process.

[02:47:33.410] - Speaker 1
It does feel like things are changing very quickly.

[02:47:35.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:47:36.500] - Speaker 1
When you say that the 55th key was a change, was it a change in the writing of the last third? Or was it a change in 5657-5859 through 64?

[02:47:50.630] - Speaker 2
No, I think it just because I didn't write them in order, so I wrote them spontaneously. Although there might be something in that that you've just said, because sequences are fascinating.

[02:48:00.130] - Speaker 1
They're fascinating, and we don't understand why they come in the order they come, but it seems to have some logic that we may not understand.

[02:48:08.880] - Speaker 2
I think you're right. I'd love to explore that more one day. The actual original sequence, it was called in Qi Ching was called the King Wen sequence, where the hexagrams were laid out in this order. And there is a beautiful story that unfurls through them. So you could say that, yes, freedom in the 55 then opens up into the intoxicated state of the 56 and then dawns the clarity of the 57. And you could look at this whole. There's lots of ways in which you can kind of tell these stories through the patterns. Yeah, I think another nice one. We talk about these thing and gene keys called the codon rings. And they were interesting when I started to contemplate them, and I gave them names, and there's 21 of them. I gave them these kind of quite colorful names. And the codon ring, which is these little families, groupings of these gene keys. Sometimes they're four, sometimes they're two, sometimes they're singles. So they're little clusters. This is a two. And it pairs the 55 with the 49. And the 49 is the key of rebirth.

[02:49:24.790] - Speaker 1
And the reason it pairs is that in a circle of the 64, there would be opposite.

[02:49:29.630] - Speaker 2
No, those are the partners we talked about. These are more mysterious. They're to do with groupings that kind of correlate through the amino acids that they share, that the gene keys share.

[02:49:41.080] - Speaker 1
I see. So each one more like shared family.

[02:49:43.860] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And they're a mirror of what happens in our DNA, of the chemical groupings. That's why they're called codons, because they code for specific amino acid connections. And remember, I'm a poet. Right? So this is a poet's view of DNA, not a scientific view, but it is based in the kind of same fractal architecture of the DNA. So it's beautiful. Yes.

[02:50:09.060] - Speaker 1
I think, who better than a poet to explain this really well?

[02:50:13.160] - Speaker 2
And it means I'm not limited by scientific language, so I can use the imagination and some smattering of scientific insight. But, yeah. So that key, the name I gave, that codon ring of those two keys together was the ring of the whirlwind. And they have lovely names like that. And they relate to the arcana of the Tarot, actually, which you might find interesting because there's 22 of them, and they also relate to the hebrew Alphabet. So it's a beautiful code. It's amazing that those codes from the tarot, which is rooted in egyptian kabbalistic mysticism, and then the 22 letters of the hebrew Alphabet are all rooted in our biology through the codon rings, through these collections in our dna, these 22 chromosomes that we have. So I love those patterns. And this particular one, the ring of the whirlwind. See if you can guess which tarot card it is. The whirlwind. It's the tower.

[02:51:18.070] - Speaker 1
Oh, yes.

[02:51:19.610] - Speaker 2
Which is the storm that's coming with the lightning and the lightning. And it involves quantum leap, a kind of massive change. That's what it relates to. And so that's why the two keys are freedom and rebirth. It's the rebirth of freedom or the freedom of rebirth. And rebirth is different from revolution, which is the gift name for 49 hexagram. 49 gene key 49, they call. It's called revolution. So the higher form of revolution is rebirth because revolution goes round and keeps doing the same, like all the revolutions we see. But rebirth is of another dimension. So it's when a whole speed, it's an entire system change, reboots itself and goes in a completely new direction that had no relationship to the old. And that's why this is quite wild and it's why the gene keys is quite a kind of very visionary in that way, because the new human has no relationship to the old human, in a way, it's founded on it. But the new direction, it looks very different. And so if you think about that, the view that we have right now through science, through evolution and all the things we know, if you're trying to project into the future, you're projecting based on what you know from the past.

[02:52:50.570] - Speaker 2
So you look at the patterns of the past and the cycles and things, and you think, well, some people might think, yeah, we're going to go to Mars and then we're going to colonize here, and then we'll find how to travel at the speed of light and technology will do all these amazing things. That's the assumption that most people have. Looking into the future, I question that, knowing what I know about the 55th gen key, because the relationship of the future is not related to the past. So it looks like there's a break. Rahu also predicted the same thing. His was a darker. I have to say, his was a darker prediction than mine. He saw it more apocalyptic. I don't see that. I see a different metaphorical story through the dragonfly, which is that. Yeah, we'll take to the air, literally, and our consciousness will find a new way to operate.

[02:53:51.450] - Speaker 1
And it sounds like a more interconnected way.

[02:53:53.920] - Speaker 2
It's very interconnected. It's a new human. It's a new human that actually has to come through birth. So, in other words, and again, something that Ra predicted is that children would start entering into the world with a genetic mutation that would then spread and slowly, over years, hundreds of years, colonize human species. It's quite wild. It's like a science fiction, but it's a positive virus in that sense, because it networks us into a new kind of intelligence. But again, the new human, even though it's related perhaps to a very old version, as you said, like the instinctive part of us, the almost deep mammalian part, the animal part of us, that really, the animals have that collective intelligence, don't they? We see it in the bird kingdom. We see it in insect kingdom. We see it in the mammals as well. Wild dogs, for example. They have a networked intelligence that enables them to work telepathically.

[02:54:56.910] - Speaker 1
I understand mushrooms as well. Mushrooms, redwood trees, totally all are in communication with each other.

[02:55:03.650] - Speaker 2
I mean, it's everywhere. And I think humans in our kind of hunter gatherer stage, before we started building civilizations, we had that same intelligence, I would say so. It is rooted in something that's deeply ancestral, but I think it's a lot more advanced in the future human, because we've gone through a lot of stages since then, so we've changed. So we can utilize that ancient intelligence which is in the gut. So we have it, and we're going to be a new hybrid kind of being. I think homo sanctus was my name for it. The sacred human. Yes.

[02:55:44.820] - Speaker 1
Beautiful. I'm thinking back to you mentioning the gene key codons, the hebrew Alphabet, and the tarot all being related. And when I first hear that, it seems like it's too far out, like it's too wild. And then the more I think about it, it's more like there's whatever reality is. And then there are different ways of explaining it. And it's almost like the same sonnet in two different languages. Of course they're saying the same thing, they're just two different languages saying the same thing. So the content is always the same for any of these systems. It's all the same. They're just a different language. But the things that they're talking about, they're using different names, they're putting different labels on it, but it's all the same.

[02:56:31.390] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[02:56:31.970] - Speaker 1
It's one system. It is. What is?

[02:56:34.550] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. They're using different number systems.

[02:56:37.710] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[02:56:38.850] - Speaker 2
The chakras, they use seven, human design uses nine, I Ching uses 64, kabbalah uses 32 or ten. Everything has a slightly different. Astrology uses twelve and lots of other potential numbers. But, yeah, all these different.

[02:57:01.120] - Speaker 1
They're all describing the same thing.

[02:57:03.000] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[02:57:03.360] - Speaker 1
They're just cutting it up in a different way.

[02:57:05.320] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yeah. It's a language of light, essentially. It's what it is.

[02:57:12.990] - Speaker 1
It's a really big revelation for me. It's exciting for me to think about. Everything makes more sense when viewed that way.

[02:57:20.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I agree. And nothing's left out?

[02:57:23.650] - Speaker 1
No.

[02:57:24.420] - Speaker 2
Even the shadow is not left out. Even corruption is not. That's what I love about the gene keys. Like, there's a gene key. Shadow 50. It's corruption. It's all in there.

[02:57:36.790] - Speaker 1
What's the gift on the corruption on 50?

[02:57:39.450] - Speaker 2
Harmony.

[02:57:40.320] - Speaker 1
Harmony.

[02:57:41.990] - Speaker 2
And so you see, like, it's just a corrupt information stream. You could look at it like, we talk about data as being corrupted. It's all it is. It's corrupted data that then has to go through a process of sorting itself out, transforming and then attaining a higher harmony, a hidden harmony, in a way. So, yeah, nothing's left out. No part of the shadow is left out. Yeah. Even sort of lots of really quite wild, difficult concepts that we struggle with, to do with suffering are also woven into these keys.

[02:58:23.170] - Speaker 1
Well, they're shadows. And the shadow is always related to light.

[02:58:28.550] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:58:29.000] - Speaker 1
There is no shadow without light.

[02:58:30.820] - Speaker 2
Exactly. I even at one point made the suggestion somewhere in the book, I think that the darkness, the shadow is actually an intensification of light, but it's so bright that you can't see it. So if you think about that, that's a different way from. Of looking at darkness. But actually, if something is really, really bright, it's so bright, it actually appears invisible or dark to us. We can't see it, we're blinded by it. And in a way, darkness, the beauty of it is that it's light, actually. There's nowhere in the universe where there isn't light.

[02:59:18.710] - Speaker 1
And in the yinyang, the dark side is the positive side, isn't it?

[02:59:25.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Well, the feminine as well. Yeah. It's the yielding. It's the out of the dark in the Bible, isn't it? Out of the darkness came forth the light. And like I said before, it's really interesting when it comes to physics, I think, and astrophysics, like the notion of black holes that suck in light. And then there's this notion that's been postulated of white holes that may be the other side of black holes. That would make sense to me anyways, intuitively would spew out light. So you'd have these two, you end up with a Taurus, a toroidal field, which is, again, what's been proposed at the kind of foundation of all natural systems are these toroidal spin sort of vortices.

[03:00:18.170] - Speaker 1
Have you ever done gene keys readings for luminaries of the past?

[03:00:24.490] - Speaker 2
Occasionally, but I haven't spent a lot of time doing that kind of thing, as you know, I don't use the profiles much myself, but, yeah, I think it would be a great idea.

[03:00:36.030] - Speaker 1
Curious.

[03:00:36.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, I love doing yours. It was just very revealing, wasn't it?

[03:00:40.050] - Speaker 1
It was shocking to me. When we looked at my reading, which we were able to find through going to genekey.com and putting in my birth date, we saw a little picture. What do you call that? The profile picture. We looked at the profile, yeah. Tell me about the shape of the profile and what the different circles mean.

[03:01:04.550] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So it's a sequencing map, basically.

[03:01:09.600] - Speaker 1
How many balls are there?

[03:01:11.770] - Speaker 2
There are eleven. Well, there are more to come, actually, which will be arriving next year. A couple more. Yeah. It's a way of telling the narrative of your awakening. And initially I saw it and kind of laid it out as three sequences. As I said, it's going to be four, actually, but there are three basic sequences. And the first one is made up of four gene keys, which are called your activation sequences. It's the one that activates the beginning of your awakening process. And it also has to do with your individual awakening and your genius, unlocking a genius inside you that lies latent. And your purpose, all same language, like your purpose, is to unlock your genius. So it's about that. And the name of my book on the front of the book is embracing your higher purpose. It's about your awakening, that higher purpose. And so those four keys are pillars, and there's a series of three pathways that move through them in a zigzag, that connect them, and that's the sequence. And so the first pathway is called challenge, and then breakthrough, and then core stability. And so your gene keys and individual gene keys are threaded along those pathways, so it gives you a unique story to you.

[03:02:36.530] - Speaker 2
So my. For instance, my top one is 64, then the next one is 63. So the challenge for me is really lying in 63, which is doubt. The shadow is doubt. So my greatest challenge has been being given all this revelation, to doubt it and to doubt myself and to just doubt whether I'm mad and do I really want to do this and go out there with all this stuff? And so I've had to overcome and explore those doubts. And the gift of hidden in that doubt is the gift of inquiry. So I've explored the doubt in depth and understood its fear base and then come to trust and then found truth, which is the. So that's my story. So, challenge. And then there's a breakthrough. I won't tell the whole story of mine, but you can.

[03:03:25.620] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm curious.

[03:03:26.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, it leads in a sequence. So that embracing of that challenge leads to a breakthrough, which leads to the next fear, which is called radiance. And the radiance is literally our kind of health operating unimpeded. So we literally do become radiant. So we all have this hidden radiance, and it's part of our genius, it's part of our emanation of our higher self, of our higher being. So unlocking one's radiance is a breakthrough that happens when we accept our challenge, our primary challenge in life. For me, my radiance is all about boundlessness, like, opening up to the potential that anything is possible, I think. And boundlessness is one of those beautiful cities. And that particular gene key, 35, is a kind of potentially miraculous. It's where miracles can enter the world. And then the final part is core stability. As your radiance starts to open up and you embrace those higher possibilities in your life and you embody them, then you actually become stable and grounded in your true purpose. So, for me, that's actually about timelessness. So you have these two pairings of their programming partners. So they're pairings in the gene keys pantheon, 63 and 64, and then five and 35, those keys, and in your activation secret.

[03:04:56.760] - Speaker 1
And again, these are not ones you chose. These are ones that are just based on when you were born.

[03:05:01.150] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[03:05:01.670] - Speaker 1
They show up in your tribe.

[03:05:02.860] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And everyone has this narrative, the same narrative of challenge, breakthrough, core, stability, but.

[03:05:09.700] - Speaker 1
What the challenge dreaded with different breakthrough is.

[03:05:12.920] - Speaker 2
So it's a lovely little narrative. It's a way of bringing people into a contemplative journey with their gene keys. It's kind of fun. And then it moves from there, from core stability, which is what gives you this kind of sense of deep purpose in the world. And then the next sequence is a much bigger sequence. It's called Venus sequence, because it has relationship to positions of planet Venus and Mars when we were born, and that Venus and Mars, for a long time in astrology and mythology, has always been connected with the polarities that live within, inside us.

[03:05:48.260] - Speaker 1
Venus of love and Mars and war.

[03:05:50.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Male and female and animus. Anima, emotions and mind, intellect. So in here, you have iq. Your iq. You have a gene key that relates to your iq. You have a gene key that relates to your eQ. So your male female sides. Your EQ is your emotional intelligence, obviously, your IQ is your intellectual intelligence. And then you have another gene key deeper called your sq, which combines the two. It's like the soul quality that transcends both of those, but also includes them both. We looked at your SQ, which was the creative. Right. The essence of creativity, the gene key one line one that you have. And I was just joking with you, because you've written a book about the foundation of creativity and gene key one, line one is the foundation of creativity, and it's right in your sq. So it's a beautiful.

[03:06:45.640] - Speaker 1
It was surprising to see. It's just bizarre.

[03:06:48.530] - Speaker 2
It's beautiful. And the Venus sequence is a powerful piece of work. It's kind of shadow work. So people that go on the journey of exploring their Venus sequence really have to come to terms with how they were wounded in their childhood, or might even be an ancestral wound that they're carrying in their dna that they aren't fully aware of, or they may be aware of it, and that their job is to come to terms with it and transform it. And so it's a wound map, basically. It's not something that most people sort of would want to consciously look at, but because it's got gene keys loaded into it, you can see that it has a higher purpose.

[03:07:31.030] - Speaker 1
And the benefit of it is it also gives you the remedies.

[03:07:34.150] - Speaker 2
It gives you the remedies, exactly. And it shows you the shadows in exact detail. And you don't just look through the keys, you look through the line numbers as well. And the line numbers are six lines for every gene key. So the line numbers are keynoted all through the sequences. And so it enables us to tell a very accurate language of how did my heart shut down when I was young? Which part of my mind went on the defensive and how. So it shows you your teenage patterns, shows you your emotional kind of defense reflexes. Doesn't matter. The story is unique to you. Only you know what happened, or sometimes people don't know what happened. But the deeper you go back, the more you see the layering of how we close down. We're actually meant to close down in order that we can open up. That's the whole sequence. So when you look at the sequence, you're looking in reverse with your awareness at here are the steps of the awakening of my heart, here are the unfolding stages. So I first have to deal with this issue of how I shut down. And it also relates to seven year cycles in our childhood, which, I mean, we know that the body is imprinted in seven year cycles biologically.

[03:08:52.970] - Speaker 2
But also I was kind of inspired by the work of Rudolf Steiner, who really, through the Steiner schools and Waldorf curriculum, has a very deep understanding of how children develop naturally. And so those three cycles relate to those eqiq sq. They relate to the three seven year cycles of childhood, seven to naught to seven, seven to 14, puberty, and then 14 to 21 teenage years, adulthood. So it's really interesting, the Venus sequence. It's like, I know a lot of people who work with it and they say it's the most profound work they've ever done. I know a lot of psychotherapists and people who really tank get just deeply embedded with it and are using it in a therapeutic way. So it's very therapeutic, but it's still a contemplative set of tools, the gene keys. But that's a very deep journey indeed, because it unpicks your relationships. Basically, it's a story of your relationships and how you relate. And so it's profound. And then the third sequence is called the pearl. And that's about prosperity. It's about how we prosper in life. And prosperity is given in slightly new definition. It's a full systems thing. Prosperity is not just about having money.

[03:10:18.680] - Speaker 2
It's about prospering through health, through vitality, in relationships and friends. It's about really finding the essence in life. And it's a lot to do with simplicity, actually. It's very hard to truly prosper in life, unless you found simplicity some form of simplicity interesting. Yeah, it's quite interesting, that one. It shows keys that might have an impact to how we run a business, for example, or how we might make money. And more than anything, it shows us how we are designed to collaborate. So it shows us. One of the gene keys is called synache, g key 44. And synarchy is the sort of higher operating system of humanity when the intelligence is networked. So it's sort of geniuses coming together and doing great things that a single genius, a single genius can do a lot. But imagine a room full of geniuses networking their intelligence together. Imagine what's possible. And the pearl sequence describes that kind of that future consciousness that I was talking about. So it's really powerful. It shows you. It gives you a kind of grid for your highest potential.

[03:11:37.960] - Speaker 1
And in each case, there are 64 keys, and there are six possible lines. And when we get our profile back, we see a key and a line and are the one through six lines. Do they always mean the same thing? So, in other words, regardless of which number gene key you have, if it's 56 one or 27 one, if it's line one, does line one always mean the same thing, regardless of what key it's attached to?

[03:12:06.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's like music with different octaves. Right. So the note is the same note, but in a different octave. It sounds in a different way.

[03:12:17.100] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[03:12:17.710] - Speaker 2
So the keynotes that are threaded through the sequences are that all line one keynotes have the same feeling, but they're different words because they're in different spheres. So the language adjusts itself, which would.

[03:12:32.950] - Speaker 1
Be the note and which would be the octave between the key and the line.

[03:12:36.870] - Speaker 2
Put it like this. If you have line one in the base, in the sphere at the bottom of your chart. Right. The keynote for that. The keynotes for those six keynotes are all in the body. They're systems in the body. So the keynote for line one is the structure of our body, which is our bones. So line ones are always structural, like bones. Right. If you move it up into different spheres, it's always still, like I said.

[03:13:15.250] - Speaker 1
With yours, so it sounds like one through six. Are the octaves.

[03:13:17.740] - Speaker 2
They're the octaves. Exactly. You get it.

[03:13:20.500] - Speaker 1
And the Key is the note.

[03:13:22.390] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And then once you learn the language, your contemplation begins to unpick your narrative, and it's a story you thread together. You have to do a bit of contemplative work, but it's beautiful because you get to see, this is my story, and I've created these programs where I did a lot of work over years, or I'd explored all the lines and gave them these keynotes, and then invited people to explore. How do you take lines free, Jinky twelve? Because if I wrote all of them, it would just take me ages. And I also wanted people to figure it out for themselves. But we know that every line three is very versatile. It's very changeable, it's very flexible. So if you then took Jinky twelve and you go, well, what's that like through that line? And how different would be if it was a line four? So the stories change. It's beautiful. It's a really beautiful thing once you learn the language, as I said, and I've written books and things so that they give you the language and the tools so that you can unpick your own story.

[03:14:36.240] - Speaker 1
But ultimately, it's all an invitation for the participant to find a way in.

[03:14:43.760] - Speaker 2
To understand their story, understand their story, their karma, their dharma, their emotions, their relationships, their relationship to money, their relationship to health. It's all in there. But you don't do it all at once. You do it in steps and stages. I laid it out in these sequences so that you do it step by step by step. If you do the whole story together, it's called the golden Path. I call all those stages and steps the golden path. You're walking the golden path. If you did the whole thing, it's at least a year's contemplation. You couldn't rush it. You could rush it, but it's going to be a minimum of a year.

[03:15:26.810] - Speaker 1
And it's not about that.

[03:15:28.060] - Speaker 2
No. Most people, they do this and they take years because the gene keys book is. And these tools are like. They're wisdom tools. It's like a course in miracles. You don't just pick it up and read it in a couple of months. You work with it for years.

[03:15:43.620] - Speaker 1
And it's also like a Rorschach test because it's giving you something to react to.

[03:15:48.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it has that lovely effect that as you're contemplating it, it starts to come alive in your life. So if you're contemplating a certain key in a certain line, like when I wrote the book, you start to see it reflected, and then you go, oh, there it is.

[03:16:06.220] - Speaker 1
I experience it all the time. Things that I'm working on where I'll have a thought about something that seems far out, and then all day long it's coming out. It's like. It's unbelievable. How did I not see this yesterday? How did I not see this every day up until the thought came? And then the thought comes like, oh, that's what everything says.

[03:16:27.570] - Speaker 2
Yeah, any contemplative journey, that's the magic of it. It comes alive. I think that's the magic of contemplation. And you're a contemplative. That's why you unlock that as well. And many, many people, most people are contemplative a little bit. And so everyone knows that experience, it appears in a dream or it appears through the Internet or something, or three.

[03:16:56.860] - Speaker 1
People mention the same thing. Three people, like, hey, have you seen this? Have you seen this? Have you seen that?

[03:17:02.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it gets really interesting when you kind of reach certain crux points in your profile journey, because there are points where there's a place in your profile in the Venus sequence called your core wound. Right? And I suggest that people kind of work their way down towards it so that they're ready to kind of look at what's my core wound. And everyone has one, right? And the core wounds of humanity are sacred in a way, because they contain great beauties. They're the way the grace is hidden, but they kind of are the nexus or the root of our suffering. So when you start contemplating those kind of things, you start to realize how your individual wound is connected to the wound of ancestry, humanity, racial gene pools everywhere. You see it. And you start to realize, oh, my God, I'm just a tiny drop in this ocean of suffering. And once you see suffering as fractal, you start to feel compassion. You then realize even terrible things that you hear about are kind of just representations of the same thing in you. So because you've touched it in yourself, you start to see it everywhere else, but you're no longer afraid of it.

[03:18:29.910] - Speaker 2
So you start to feel true compassion, the kind of compassion that masters speak of. It's not just a made up word. It's a felt resonance that comes as love and understanding. You understand why that person did that awful thing. You understand because you've got it in you. And so that becomes really interesting when we get down to those depths.

[03:18:57.050] - Speaker 1
I have a fun idea of an experiment for us to try. We could try it right now. Tell me what you think. I think of the Jeden keys as a very human system. And since it's rooted in time, because this starts with the time of birth, if we were to take an event from history that happened at a specific time, we could do walking on the moon and look at the key for the moment man walked on the moon and see what comes up. It's interesting. Have you ever used it in a non human way?

[03:19:30.170] - Speaker 2
Some have. I know some people have done a lot of that kind of stuff. And astrologers do a lot of that. And. Yeah, it's fascinating. Always. We do it with my business, for example, when the business was founded, we did a little profile because it gives us keys of, like, this is what we're here to do. This is our dharma. Any project that begins if you know the key when it begins because it's the same as birth, isn't it? Something was born. What is that moment of imprinting? What were the forces kind of spiraling around? What was the fractal of that particular moment? Yeah, I love doing that.

[03:20:07.760] - Speaker 1
Should we do one?

[03:20:08.720] - Speaker 2
Sure.

[03:20:09.140] - Speaker 1
What would be a pick an event?

[03:20:10.820] - Speaker 2
Oh, well, I don't know. We'd then have to. Yeah. Maybe a more recent one. So it's a little easier.

[03:20:17.120] - Speaker 1
Let's see. What would be big event that we could time down to the hour.

[03:20:22.570] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Or moment like pivotal moments like discoveries of penicillin, that kind of thing. That changed. Yeah.

[03:20:32.780] - Speaker 1
We can do penicillin if you'd like.

[03:20:34.500] - Speaker 2
It's kind of interesting because it led to the healing of vast. Let's see numbers of people.

[03:20:40.220] - Speaker 1
Let's see if there's a date associated.

[03:20:42.170] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I wonder.

[03:20:43.810] - Speaker 1
September 3, 1920.

[03:20:46.760] - Speaker 2
819. 28. That's not too far.

[03:20:50.470] - Speaker 1
That's according to the History Channel.

[03:20:53.730] - Speaker 2
It's. It's good enough. So. Okay, got it. So according to me, the discovery of penicillin took place when the sun was in Jinky. 40. And line six. And the earth, which is opposite. So they're a pair. There's always these programming partner, these pairs. Can you look? We can look at the pairs. Is 37, line six. So you get to see those 240. And 37. And 40 is there. The city is about divine will. So it's like. It's really powerful. These are moments of something higher touching down and occurring that's beyond our understanding. So kind of a form of grace. And the 6th line always also makes.

[03:21:55.430] - Speaker 1
Sense that it happened by accident.

[03:21:57.930] - Speaker 2
Exactly. You can't speak control, which is an insight, generally about life and dharma and destiny as a whole. And the 37, which pairs with it is the hexagram of the family. Right. The human family, you could say. So this impacted the entire human family and probably healed huge numbers of families because penicillin, as we know, led to the kind of eradication of all kinds of horrendous viruses and development of modern medicine and immunology and stuff. And the 6th line brings this kind of vision with it. It's at the top of a hexagram. So it brings something always for the future. It's always about the future. Line one is always, like, rooted in the ancestry or the past. And then line six links us to something beyond us. So it fits really beautifully. I mean, the shadow of 40 is exhaustion. You could kind of look at that as, like, the exhaustion of human vitality just disappearing. And then 37, it's the shadow of weakness. So you could look at that. If you look at it at a broad level, it's like the weakening of the immune system that just draws all our energy away. This was a time in which a higher frequency was kind of landed that had a deep effect on the human family, on all families, on maybe brought us all together in some way.

[03:23:45.870] - Speaker 2
So hope, six lines also carry kind of faith. Hope, they carry that sort of for the future. Here's something. And it did. We're still, like, pretty accurate. Yeah. So it's kind of nice to look at those things. I don't often do. And you can go and look at other aspects of gene keys as well, because you can look at other planetary positions and things and pull out more information.

[03:24:10.920] - Speaker 1
Are you ever surprised by what comes up through the keys?

[03:24:14.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean, I'm wonderfully surprised, like, seeing your one, line one, I was like, if I were going to say Rick's got anything, I'd be like, yeah.

[03:24:23.270] - Speaker 1
I would never believe it wouldn't be possible.

[03:24:25.640] - Speaker 2
No. The foundation of creativity is definitely what lies in your heart. Yeah.

[03:24:33.050] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[03:24:33.480] - Speaker 2
Your soul's purpose.
