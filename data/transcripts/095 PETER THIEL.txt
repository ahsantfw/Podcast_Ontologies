[00:00:07.400] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammaton.

[00:00:21.760] - Speaker 1
I was myself a product of an elite education. I was Stanford undergraduate, Stanford Law School, and And I graduated from Undergrad 89 law school, class of 1992. And then probably throughout the '90s and 2000s, I had a bias towards hiring people from the top universities. I thought there were things that had gone haywire with them. There was too much uniformity, too much political correctness. But I still believe that they were an incredibly important ways that the elites in our society get formed and that one had to reform them or do something about them if you're going to have an impact on an elite level in our society. My first really big breakthrough success was PayPal, which was in the years '98 to 2002, and then I invested in Facebook in 2004. By the late 2000s, by many standards, I was quite a successful person. And circa 2007, 2008, I thought that the big philanthropy thing, I wanted to do my one big philanthropy project, was going to start a new university. It was a little bit vague, but the fantasy was that it was going to be a liberal arts college where people somehow got a broad education about the world.

[00:01:44.780] - Speaker 1
Maybe they also would be trained in computer science or something. It would both be good for life and good in a theoretical way and in a practical way. For about a year, year and a half, one of my colleagues, we did this research project, and we looked at all the universities that had been started in the United States. We arbitrarily picked the 100 years before, so 1907 to 2007. When you looked at that 100-year process, it was a tale of donor intent, betrayed and money wasted. You got the sense that it was really, really hard to start a new university. It was somehow this, I can come up with all these theories why, but just empirically, in a broad brush stroke, almost everybody who tried to do it had failed quite badly. Even though I like to think of myself as smarter than other people, I don't think of myself as that much smarter. If you've seen something which people have tried to do for 100 years and never succeeded needed, you start to wonder if maybe something very different needs to be done. That was at least part of the genesis, the idea that maybe too much money is going into this higher education system, and maybe it would be good to get people out of it instead of pulling them in.

[00:03:00.790] - Speaker 1
It would be good not to try to hire a few more faculty or graduate students or something, but to-A new model. Have a completely new model. In September of 2010, there was a tech conference in San Francisco I was going to give a talk at. And it was like 24 hours before we came up with this idea. We're going to talk about the universities and how they were broken. And we came up with this idea, and we brainstormed it. Should we have 32 32 kids. No, that's 32 is like the road scholarship. We don't want it to be just a copycat of the road scholar. And then we came up with 20 Under 20, but it was like a 24 hour brainstorming session. We were figuring it out in a half hour drive over to the talk I was giving that morning, and then they took off.

[00:03:48.290] - Speaker 2
What was the first year that you did it?

[00:03:50.380] - Speaker 1
Well, we announced it in fall of 2010, and then effectively, the first year was 2011. It was basically envisioned as a two year program. We gave people stipends of 50,000 a year, 100,000 over two years. There were all sorts of things that were imperfect. There were all sorts of questions. Is this really something we should do in a nonprofit versus a for-profit context? But it hit a very raw nerve because it was clear the system was way more exhausted than people thought. There was a Silicon Valley reporter I did an interview with in 2011, and it was like, this is a very controversial, crazy idea. Peter has, was the way it was presented. But then you looked at the comments section, and 70% of people in the comment section agreed with me. So already in 2010, 2011, it was maybe was unconventional for me to articulate this, but there was a sense that the business as usual was not quite working. Always bad at doing the autobiography personal history thing, but the summary autobiography I always give of myself. I always see myself as in some ways having been very guilty of these same things.

[00:05:00.410] - Speaker 1
You often see your younger version having done certain things wrong that maybe you couldn't have done differently or you would never have known differently. But in retrospect, as a lot of talented kids, was just hyper-tract. And so my eighth-grade junior high school yearbook, my best friend wrote in, I know in four years, you're going to get into Stanford. And then four years later, I got into Stanford, and I got into Stanford law school. And then I ended up at a top New York law firm. And it was one of these very strange places where from the outside, everybody wanted to get in. On the inside, everybody wanted to get out. And so in my mid 20s, I had a quarter life crisis. Why in the world was I so dominated by social status, prestige? The money was okay. It wasn't that great relative to selling your soul or something like that.

[00:05:52.660] - Speaker 2
Did you feel like it was selling your soul?

[00:05:53.890] - Speaker 1
I felt it was on that scale.

[00:05:57.000] - Speaker 2
In other words, you achieved it because it It was the goal to get to. But when you were there, you realized that it was empty for you.

[00:06:05.370] - Speaker 1
Yes, but it was an odd goal because if you ask, where did that goal come from? It didn't really come from.

[00:06:11.730] - Speaker 2
Where did it come from?

[00:06:13.560] - Speaker 1
It somehow came from our society broadly. It came from, I would say, two-thirds of the undergraduates at Stanford in the 1980s were on one of four tracks. It was pre-law, pre-medicine, pre-banking, and pre-consulting. My sophomore year, I decided to major in philosophy, so I had this Humanities major. On some level, this is not what I was thinking as an undergraduate sophomore, but in some ways, when you chose to major in philosophy, you were already deciding to go to law school. So there's all these points where you implicitly make decisions, even though you're not consciously aware of them.

[00:06:54.940] - Speaker 2
Of course, you could have-Was there any pressure from your parents or none?

[00:06:57.820] - Speaker 1
There was surprisingly little pressure. I was born in Germany. We immigrated the States when I was a year old. So they wanted me to get a good education, so they believed in that strongly. They weren't as immersed in the elite American system. So it sounded good to them, but-How did they move to the US? My dad worked as an engineer, and he got a master's degree at Case Western in Cleveland, and then working on these large engineering projects, a Bechtel a thing. There was a way that the tracking was, I would say, was very, very socially grouped. It's everyone wants what everyone wants, which is on one level, just a tautology, and another level is this incredibly powerful dynamical process. And there was something like this that was very powerful. There was an elite education track, generally. And then, of course, there were these particular tracks of banking, consulting, law, medicine that dominated the elite education. And then I think the strange history of it is that you can think of the global financial crisis in 2008 as the point where all the tracks blow up, maybe centered the most on banking. Medicine had already gone haywire for a long time.

[00:08:17.700] - Speaker 1
Elite law was often adjacent to banking. In some ways, all these tracks got deranged in 2008. There was around 2009, 2010, when we started the TAL fellowship, there is actually a real opening to rethink this stuff for the first time in decades in the US. And there are all these different ways you can describe it. You can also describe it in terms of the student debt problem. In the year 2000, student debt in the US stood at $300 billion. It now stands at $2 trillion. So 300 billion was a lot. But in the '90s or 2000s, there was a way you could get a decent job and earn your way out of it. Maybe it took longer to start a family and to buy a house than it otherwise would have. But there was a way in which it was manageable. And gradually, the costs and the debt just went up so much more than inflation that it just ended up in a hole where it got harder and harder to get out.

[00:09:18.010] - Speaker 2
I have a student debt question, which is there's talk of government relieving student debt, and the way that it would be relieved would be the government would pay for it instead of the students paying for it. Yes. Why is the idea idea that the government would pay for it instead of these institutions that have these huge endowments just erasing the debt?

[00:09:37.460] - Speaker 1
The place where I am sympathetic, I'm probably a big critic of the Biden administration and of the left. I am somewhat sympathetic to the idea that something has to be done about the student debt problem in some way, and that in many ways, we've doubled down on the system. So in 2005, the bankruptcy laws got rewritten under Bush 43, where you cannot discharge student debt even if you go bankrupt. And so if you go bankrupt-And why would that be? Well, because we wanted to make sure the system kept working. The theory is the debt attaches to you as a person. And so you got all this great education, and You can't get rid of the education, and therefore, you also can't get rid of the debt. And if you don't pay it off by the time you're 65, we'll start garnishing your social security checks and use that to pay off the student debt. And then there are all these ways the debt debt got worse and worse. If you do a cohort analysis, if you graduated in 1997, 12 years later, by 2009, most '97 graduates had gotten out of most of their debt.

[00:10:42.670] - Speaker 1
2009, first year after the financial Financial crisis is the first cohort where when you look at it 12 years later in 2021, the median person with debt has more debt than they started in 2009. So you can't even make the interest payments.

[00:10:59.760] - Speaker 2
That's It's a big change.

[00:11:00.300] - Speaker 1
And it, of course, has this backward-looking feature where it's a big change, but it takes 12 years to notice that you're somehow in a more corrupt and different regime.

[00:11:11.310] - Speaker 2
But even after noticing it after 12 years, nothing has changed.

[00:11:13.920] - Speaker 1
Well, that's where the Biden administration tried to start doing some things. Then you have these very crude measures where maybe we just cancel the debt and make the taxpayers pay for it because you don't want to question the ideological assumption you had, which is that college education is so wonderful. So if you start saying, College education is not so good, and it's been counterproductive for a lot of people, maybe we'll cancel the debt, but we're going to put these colleges under a lot more scrutiny. You weren't supposed to do that. And so they wanted to cancel it, but then they were boxed in ideologically in all sorts of ways. I believe the total amount of money in all the college endowments put together is only $800 or $900 billion. So it's weirdly less than the student debt, and it's very uneven. So it's like Harvard and Stanford have like 40 or $50 billion, and then it quickly drops off. So in some sense, the college is charged a lot, but they were not terribly well run. The money was mostly wasted. It went to a lot of overhead, administrative bloat. If you make the colleges even partially responsible, probably a lot of them would go bankrupt.

[00:12:27.450] - Speaker 1
Then the other drastic thing you can do is just say the debt holders are responsible. Then, of course, they will say that it had been guaranteed by the government. Then maybe there's some point where the government should actually just say it was really an evil thing to give all these people this debt, and you're going to have to take somewhat of a haircut, but it's weirdly boxed in. It's very, very, very slow moving. It's led to this, I think, experience for much of the millennial generation and even more for Gen Z kids now going to college.

[00:13:02.900] - Speaker 2
Are the terms of the student loans onerous?

[00:13:07.140] - Speaker 1
I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. It's several % above the risk-free rate I imagine it's maybe typically a 6, 7, 8 % interest rate, which is probably not an unreasonably high rate given how risky the debt is. I'm not sure the rate is ridiculously high, but it's just the amount is high.

[00:13:31.710] - Speaker 2
Understood. What have you learned from the experience of starting this? What didn't work?

[00:13:40.650] - Speaker 1
It worked very broadly. If we define work simply as a better alternative than going to college. Anyone who got a tail fellowship could always go back to college. They weren't dropping out. We always say they only were stopping out because the colleges, if you stop out of college for 10 years, the colleges still would like you to come back and finish your degree because they have all these statistics. They want to have as high a % of people who start finish as possible. I think roughly three quarters of the people who went in the program did not go back to college and found better things to do, not necessarily that their companies would succeed. And a lot of it was tech adjacent, and they somehow got into this Silicon Valley world, Silicon Valley Network. And there were a lot of opportunities that came with, you try to do something entrepreneurial, you learn a great deal, you meet a lot of people. And so it was, I wouldn't say it was an alternate track, but it was a way to restart people's traject that worked quite well. The outliers are way more successful than the medians.

[00:14:47.700] - Speaker 1
You do end up with a crazy amount of variation. Probably the single most successful tailfell in terms of impact was Scott Guertaran, who started Ethereum. And And so it was the second biggest cryptocurrency, and I don't have the number right in front of me, but it's probably like an aggregate worth $400 billion or something like that. I mean, it was this crazy person who had this fantasy about building a world computer and turning the world into a giant computer, and it would be computing Ethereum, and it wasn't even a company. It was just this computer protocol, and somehow There were things like that that one could do. Then there were probably things that were extremely ambitious and where if you're a very young person, you weren't necessarily embedded enough. You could start something like Ethereum, where just a small number of people could do an iteration of the Bitcoin crypto protocol and start Ethereum. That was possible in the world of 2014. Another one had built a small nuclear reactor in his parents' basement in Arkansas. But then the problem was the next thing you have to do is get $50 million to build a bigger reactor.

[00:16:07.230] - Speaker 1
And then that might not be that easy to do if you're 17 years old.

[00:16:12.510] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's wild, though.

[00:16:13.380] - Speaker 1
But it was a The opposite of the stories that I know people told themselves when I was in college in the '80s, where the tracks are set. There's a certain grooved way you're supposed to compete with people. There are a lot of different things people This was allowing people to try something difficult, exciting, that they're passionate about, that most sane people would say, That's a bad idea.

[00:16:41.720] - Speaker 2
Don't do that. Don't even consider it.

[00:16:43.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah, don't even consider it Finish school. Something impactful. It's always hard to measure this, but something counterfactually relevant where if you didn't do it, it would never get done. I'm not always sure hard is the criterion. This was always a debate. Max Lepch and my PayPal co founder, and I had in '99, 2000. And he always thought we needed to do things that were hard. And I always said we need to do things that were valuable. And he would say, well, anything that's valuable is necessarily hard. And I would say things that are hard are not necessarily valuable. It's true. And so it's extremely hard to get a medal in the Olympics. How valuable that is in an economic sense. What's the value of the bronze and a bronze medal?

[00:17:35.980] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story PayPal from the beginning.

[00:17:38.580] - Speaker 1
Probably a lot of these companies, it's always so much mythologizing. You're always It's connected to red-con, the stories, which is this Hollywood term retroactive continuity, where you somehow tell a coherent single narrative from the very beginning. We had elements of that There were, of course, there was a lot of stuff we had no clue about. If we'd known how hard it was to build a payments company, we probably would have never started. So there were ways in which being clueless was a bug, but also a feature.

[00:18:12.580] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because otherwise, if you knew how hard it was, you might not have done it.

[00:18:14.610] - Speaker 1
You would have known why not to start it. I met up with Max Levchin. We somehow connected in the summer of 1998. He had gone to University of Illinois. There were some of his friends I'd met in Silicon Valley. In the fall of '98, he wanted to start a company. We started brainstorming different ideas. He was into cryptography, which was all these complicated privacy protocols and things where messages could not be decrypted. I had more of a finance background, but I was interested in some financial applications of cryptography. Could one create... We had nothing I like the Bitcoin idea, but the worst thing is, could you somehow encrypt money? Could you find a way to shift the dollars away from government control to the privacy of a wallet? We were loosely in this financial cryptography idea at the beginning. And then, of course, you have to come up with a way. You have this big picture idea. So it's changing the nature of money. That's a big idea. And then how you do this? How do you attack the problem?

[00:19:28.430] - Speaker 2
Do you think of it as digital money or no?

[00:19:33.530] - Speaker 1
To some extent, there had already been various attempts of digital money in the '80s, '90s. There was a company called DigitCash, I think had been started years earlier and had just gone bankrupt around 1998. And there was this, I think it was David Chum was the mathematician, cryptographer who had helped start it. And so there were a lot of theoretical ideas about it, but there were also It's these very practical ideas. You have something that can work in theory, but how do you get people to use it? There's a way in which if everyone's using it, so if a billion people are using it, I can understand why the other 999 million plus are using it. But why would the first person use a new form of money with a thousandth person? We thought a lot about how do you initiate a new form of money? How do you start it? It looks like a network, but what's the value of a network if nobody's in it? There were a lot of these questions. We had all these different business models. February 1999, our first plan was we're going to do encrypted money on Palm Pilots, which was this small computing platform that a few million people were using.

[00:20:46.050] - Speaker 1
But then why would you need a money on Palm Pilots if you just had your wallet on you? So there were all these basic questions.

[00:20:52.650] - Speaker 2
Did you get it to work on Palm Pilots?

[00:20:54.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Two, three years later, we had maybe 4 million users, and maybe 6,000 were on Palm Pilots. So it was not the best approach. The question, the practical, we have this big picture theory question about the nature of money, financial cryptography. And then we had this detailed question of, how do you get distribution? How do you market it? How do you get people to use it? And the idea we somehow stumbled on, we were just brainstorming all these different ideas, summer of '99, fall of '99 as we launched it. And we finally hit on the idea that you had to bootstrap it off some pre-existing network. And the natural pre-existing network was something like email. And there were, I want to say, maybe 150, 200 million people with email addresses. And so if you could use someone's email, all you have to do is type in their email, and then you have an account with PayPal, and you send them money. And then we create a virtual account in that person's name. You send them $50, and then It's you've gotten $50, and then you have to click on this link and give us your bank account or other information, and we'll get the $50 out to you.

[00:22:08.880] - Speaker 1
And so email turned out to be a way you could bootstrap it, and you could have what I've described as a one away network. You only needed the sender on. The receiver, who would be more interested in joining the network since you got the money, would naturally sign up. Whereas the DigiCash and all these pre PayPal digital currencies were networks that only worked if other people were on them first.

[00:22:33.060] - Speaker 2
Describe the world in 1999, technically, so we know what were the devices people were using? Were there search engines yet? What was happening?

[00:22:41.360] - Speaker 1
You had search engines. It was dominated by desktops. People had cell phones. There was a thought that you'd eventually be able to do Internet things on cell phones, but it was extremely minimal. We had this pitch in June of '99. We were going to be the world's first mobile Internet bank, and this was like a decade too early. But we got Nokia. I had a venture firm. Nokia Ventures was our Series A investor in summer of 1999. And then one month after they invested, we told them, we thought some more about the mobile Internet. We think it's actually pretty far away. We're going to pivot back to the regular internet, and we're just going to try to bootstrap it off of email. You had a decent amount of e-commerce. You had Amazon, you had lots of other sites.

[00:23:28.230] - Speaker 2
Was Amazon just books at that time?

[00:23:30.160] - Speaker 1
It had already diversified into a wider range of things. And then eBay was this rather big thing. But when we launched in October of 1999, we had actually no particular idea who would use it. And we started with the 24 people in our office. They got PayPal accounts. And then we thought of all these things. Maybe we could do partnerships with Amex. We spent two months talking them. We sent them all these boxes, and they couldn't figure out who in their New York office should open our boxes. And it boxes got sent back to us. Okay, so we can't do a partnership with a big company. Maybe we can do advertising. Advertising was super inefficient. And then by this weird process of elimination, we included that the cheapest way to get more people to open PayPal accounts was just to pay them money.

[00:24:19.150] - Speaker 2
You paid people to use the service.

[00:24:20.770] - Speaker 1
We paid you $10 if you opened account, and another $10 if you got someone else to open an account.

[00:24:27.420] - Speaker 2
Tell me about when the light bulb went off, it's like, Let's pay people to use it.

[00:24:31.650] - Speaker 1
We needed the network to grow as fast as possible. It was like, if you advertised on Yahoo, it would cost you $50 or $100 to get a customer. It was cheaper just to pay people directly. Then, of course, you think, well, it's going to be some really bad adverse selection. But at least if you pay people and I send you money, I'll send money to somebody where there's a connection between the two people. And maybe that's actually a more organic way than if you just randomly advertise on the internet, you get this These disconnected notes. If it works, it works.

[00:25:02.460] - Speaker 2
That's the other part.

[00:25:03.390] - Speaker 1
It took off exponentially. We were up to a thousand users by mid-November. By December 31st, 1999, we were up to 12,000. We crossed the 100,000 mark early February of 2000, and we hit a million by April 15th.

[00:25:20.250] - Speaker 2
When did you have to stop paying people to use it?

[00:25:23.430] - Speaker 1
You gradually dialed it back, but we probably burned through about $20 million by mid-April. So it was an exponentially growing user base, an exponentially growing marketing base. And then you gradually dialed it back where people have to give us more information to get the referral bonuses. Maybe you have to give us your bank account number. You never fully turn it off, but you just gradually added more conditions to it. And then, of course, as more people are using it, you start noticing the use case patterns. And it turned out that the place where it was used very heavily was on eBay, which was this network of small businesses selling stuff to other people who are often both buyers and sellers on eBay in terms. It was a naturally super-networked economy. Very small businesses or individuals typically can't accept credit cards. In the US, I don't know, there were maybe 100 million people with email. In early 2000, there were maybe two or three million people who could accept credit credit cards. And so if you can't accept a credit card, your next best alternative was for someone to send you a check, and that took 7 to 10 days to clear.

[00:26:38.240] - Speaker 1
And then PayPal had the system where the money was good right away. Maybe we'd have to eventually send you a check, but you could then take the money, turn around and use it. And so it was an extremely natural-Creative match with the UK. Extremely natural use case. And of course, there were all these questions about fraud that we ignored and we then dealt with later. In the world of 1999, 2000, all this stuff was way less regulated. It was pre-911. You could not have started a company like this after 911. There were relatively few know your customer requirements. Maybe if you had tens of thousands of dollars, but if someone's moving $50 in the world of early 2000, nobody thought this is probably just a terrorist or something like this. And so there was an opening to start a business like this for it to gain traction. You could not have done it a year or two earlier, and two years later, it probably would have been completely illegal.

[00:27:35.110] - Speaker 2
And then how long did you continue to build PayPal? And tell me about the PayPal Mafia, because it's storied.

[00:27:45.000] - Speaker 1
So we launched the product in late '99. Elon had a competing company four blocks down the street. He was at 384 University Avenue in Palo Alto. We were at 165 University Avenue, and it was this crazy war.

[00:28:02.260] - Speaker 2
And then we decided-Is that how you met him?

[00:28:04.350] - Speaker 1
We were just competing like crazy. And then we decided to do a 50/50 merger in early March of 2000. Of course, we both had exponential burn rates.

[00:28:14.830] - Speaker 2
It's interesting, both of you had a similar vision for this digital payment system.

[00:28:19.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah, his company was ex. Com, Elon with his ex-word obsession. His vision was for it to be this multifaceted online bank checking accounts and all these different things you could do. But he had, by late '99, also zeroed in on payments as the initial piece to start with. We combined the companies. We figured out ways to keep scaling it. We gradually started charging people for making payments.

[00:28:52.950] - Speaker 2
Like one or two %?

[00:28:54.810] - Speaker 1
Yeah, like two, two and a half %, like roughly the same as a credit card. And then parts were funded by credit cards. That was a very low margin part. Then about half the payments ended up being funded through ACH, which is like through someone's bank account. And that was one of our big innovations. And then we burned through a lot of money, but we quickly reduced the burn rate, and the company was profitable by fourth quarter of 2001. Wow. It went public in early 2002. This was now all after the dot com bubble had burst. But we were one of the few survivors. And then there were these natural synergies with eBay, where in some ways, all these mixed things one could say about it. It was this very boring MBA run a business. And you had this crazy PayPal business that was running the checkout counter, and they only needed to figure out how to get their own checkout counter to work once. They weren't quite able to figure it out. And so it was sad that we ended up selling PayPal to eBay, but it was fortunate that they were two in to run their own checkout counter since otherwise, it would have just ended more badly.

[00:30:06.490] - Speaker 1
So we combined the company with eBay in the fall of 2002, and in some ways-Do you have any feelings of remorse doing that or only good feelings.

[00:30:18.160] - Speaker 2
It's the first time you built a company and selling it. It must be some emotional component.

[00:30:24.160] - Speaker 1
It felt like clearly the right thing at the time. The synergies were We're very big. And then at the same time, it is very sad because you lose control. And there were all these things about that were crazy and charismatic, and there was a wild libertarian crypto-anarchist undercurrent. We were now going to become this boring corporate culture. It was sold for one and a half billion to eBay, which seemed like a lot of money in 2002. Decades A decade and a half later, when PayPal got spun out, again, as its own standalone company, it would eventually get to a market cap of north of 100 billion. Then when you look back, it's like, wow, do we really have to sell it for one and a half billion if it's worth 100? But It felt hard to navigate through all the things because if 70% of the payments are on eBay, and that's the part that's growing the fastest, it was just so natural.

[00:31:28.550] - Speaker 2
Did you guys continue to run it with eBay, or did you immediately take off when it was sold?

[00:31:34.900] - Speaker 1
It varied for different people. I was the CEO at the time. I think the CEO is always the single most redundant person in an acquisition. It was probably natural for me to leave. It was probably highly desired by the senior eBay management that I lead. Quite a number of the other senior people left within a few months. It was also, by this point, it was just a well-running machine. We'd figured out all these creative product things. Maybe there were some more things one could have figured out. We didn't have that many ideas left.

[00:32:11.050] - Speaker 2
The mission was accomplished.

[00:32:12.510] - Speaker 1
There was a part of it where we were out of ideas. There were new things people did in payments years later, were things to do in mobile payments. There were all sorts of somewhat different things, but not that much happened, I would say, in the payments world in the six years, let's say, after we to eBay and before the iPhone gets started.

[00:32:32.570] - Speaker 2
At that point in time, did you see yourself as a serial entrepreneur or investor, and this is what I'm doing for the rest of my life?

[00:32:42.480] - Speaker 1
Well, the PayPal thing felt really big. It was really insane. So it was like-You couldn't think past it. Every day, you had a near-death experience, and you were going to take over the world, and you moved between heaven and hell five or six times a day. Very exciting. If you told someone this is going to go on for 26 years and it's a marathon, that would have been an incredibly exhausting thought to have at the time. A lot of it was just, how do we survive the next month, the next three months, the next six months, things like that. Then I think things were quite unformed in 2002, 2003. There was a way, at least for myself, there were all these different things I thought of doing. I scaled up a hedge fund. I started doing angel investing as a venture capitalist. I was involved in starting several different businesses. We tried a variety of things that were more old economy. And then the piece that worked by far the best were these iterations on Internet ideas. And yes, in a way, it was sad for me and for a lot of the PayPal founders to leave.

[00:33:56.610] - Speaker 1
But it was actually a good time because it was probably the point of maximum depression on the Internet in '02, '03, '04. It felt like there were no new ideas possible. Nobody was trying. And in retrospect, that was actually it was a good time to start all sorts of things. I meet Mark Zuckerberg. By summer of 2004, ended up being the seed investor in Facebook. I started a company called Palantir.

[00:34:29.960] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the first time you met Zuckerberg.

[00:34:32.650] - Speaker 1
It was at my office in downtown San Francisco.

[00:34:36.990] - Speaker 2
Did Facebook already exist or no?

[00:34:39.160] - Speaker 1
It existed as a website. They had some messed up corporate structure. Zuckerberg was 19 years old. It was just past his sophomore year at Harvard. He moved to California for the summer. I'm not sure he had actually decided to stop out of Harvard yet. They had launched it at Harvard and maybe 20 other colleges colleges, and they basically just needed to buy some more computers to launch it at 100 more colleges in the fall.

[00:35:08.080] - Speaker 2
Was there already the plan to go beyond colleges, or was colleges the whole plan at that point in time?

[00:35:13.330] - Speaker 1
Colleges was the whole plan, but I had started one of these conservative student newspapers when I was an undergraduate at Stanford, and I already had a little bit of this monopoly idea, and I thought, actually, you have to think of Facebook. It's like It's the student newspaper. It's the online media equivalent of a student newspaper. We have a chance to have a single media company that will be the new economy version of thousands of student newspapers. If you could aggregate the thousands of student newspaper.

[00:35:48.700] - Speaker 2
It's a great idea. It's a great idea. Even if that's all it was, it would be a great idea.

[00:35:52.170] - Speaker 1
I mean, that would be like a billion dollar business. Then in a way, you had these small but very tight networks at every single college. I believe at Harvard, it was something like 6,000, 7,000 undergraduates, maybe a little bit more in the graduate school. But it was something on the undergraduate level, I believe it was something like within 10 days of launch, You got to 60 % market share, 60 % of the undergraduates that signed up. And so the pro-Facebook, pro-metta, I think that I very strongly believed at the time, and I am still quite partial to, was It was that people were actually pretty isolated in college. It was quite scary to go to college when you leave high school, you don't know anybody. And it was a way to make some friendships before you even showed up. It was a way for people to get better connected in college life and to make it a much richer experience.

[00:36:52.920] - Speaker 2
It seems like communication is always good.

[00:36:56.430] - Speaker 1
I don't know if I'd be quite as panglossian as that today, but there probably are contexts where it also really deranges people. And so if we don't like each other and we just tell each other how much we hate each other, and maybe peace through separateness is better than just ever more deranged communications. But certainly, the picture in the world of 2004, 2005, it was more transparent, more efficient, just a very different world from the discount connected 20th century we had just left behind us.

[00:37:33.550] - Speaker 2
How would you compare the roller coaster ride that you witnessed with Facebook versus PayPal? How were they similar? How were they different?

[00:37:42.170] - Speaker 1
Paypal was, in a way, a much more complicated thing because you had to think about how to integrate with all these existing credit cards and bank accounts. You needed a lot of customer service. If people had questions, if you have $100 stuck with you, you have to have an actual human being to answer questions. There were more problems of a fraud nature. It was an incredibly complicated product in a way. Facebook, it was just this It just hit the zeitgeist perfectly. And maybe something like this would not have quite been possible a few years earlier, where there was not enough broadband, and so you couldn't actually download all these pictures and all these images. And so Facebook starts to be possible in a world of 2004, probably was not quite possible in '99 or 2000. So there was a way that it was in the air There were all these different approaches to social media that people had. Close rival was this company called MySpace. I often think the names of companies are incredibly important. Paypal was in a way like it was this easy to spell, two-word name.

[00:39:06.070] - Speaker 2
It sounds friendly.

[00:39:07.720] - Speaker 1
It sounds friendly. Initially, it was just to pay your pal. But then it turned out the second more important meaning was it was your pal who helps you pay. It had this fantastic dual meaning. Facebook alluded to a college Facebook, where you put something about yourself, and then you read about other people. And my space was the LA. Facebook starts at Harvard. Myspace starts in LA. They're both social media. They're both about self-expression and about learning about other people. So they involve both writing and reading.

[00:39:49.800] - Speaker 2
They start at the same time?

[00:39:50.800] - Speaker 1
I want to say it was roughly the same time, but the emphasis is different in a subtle way, where my space, it's a little bit more this narcissistic LA self-expression. And so it's more dominated by writing and less about reading. And then Facebook, the stress is 90% on reading about other people. And then that turned out to be the correct balance. Facebook was in a way, the stress was more on everybody else. Myspace, the stress was just on you as a disconnected person. And I think even the name somehow anticipated the arc of the company. But, yeah, it just hit the zeitgeist in an incredibly powerful way. I don't remember exactly when it got opened more broadly. I think it was about two years, maybe 2006, early, maybe 2007, that you start opening Facebook to everybody. It was just this incredible exponential growth for years and years and years. Then it was not just the US, it was in some ways the whole world.

[00:40:56.970] - Speaker 2
You were on the board of Facebook for a long time, yes.

[00:40:59.410] - Speaker 1
2005 to 2022, 17 years.

[00:41:02.480] - Speaker 2
Why did you decide to leave?

[00:41:04.970] - Speaker 1
Well, 17 years is a long time to be on a board. For sure. There always are lots of different things to say on this. There's a way that public company boards are much less fun than private company boards. Once you're on a board of a public company, in some sense, it's a formal, more legal a thing. It's a lot more process, a lot less this creative brainstorming substance. And so Facebook went public in 2012, and I probably was talking about leaving the board. Since then. Then, and then. Soon after. And then Then at the same time, I was genuinely grateful to Mark for letting me invest and all the success I had. And so I stayed on the board for another decade after it was public. And of course, there are all these different ways that the big tech companies became bigger than anyone would have thought. And then, I don't know, you end up with all the attributes of the Judeo-Christian God, where it's omnipotent and omniscient. And if it's not omnibenevolent, it must be omnimolevolent. And so there were endless number of crazy dynamics. But they kicked in at Facebook at a much, much later stage than at PayPal.

[00:42:27.320] - Speaker 2
You talked about names of companies. If we think of companies that have either mission statements or mottos like Google had, Don't be evil, where does the idea of a motto or a mission statement fit in in your world?

[00:42:42.850] - Speaker 1
I think it's very important. I don't know whether it always has to just be this super short motto, but I think there's always some a tight narrative you want on what is this company doing that is unique that is different. I believe it's in Tolstoy's, I think it's Anna Karenina, where at some point, Tolstoy says something like, All happy families are alike, and all unhappy families are unhappy in their own special way. And I always have this weird cut where something like the opposite is true with companies, where all unhappy companies are alike because they're somehow undifferentiated and they're hyper competitive. All happy companies are unique in their own special way, and they found something that they're doing that nobody else is doing or that they're doing better. So I always think there's some a narrative like that that you want. On some level, companies are about capitalism and success and making money, but it's a very lame company where you don't have some a narrative of why it matters, why it matters to the larger world, why if you weren't doing it, this wouldn't happen, things of that sort. Then, of course, the place where I'm always hesitant, though, with the corporate speak is that it can get hijacked in all these ways.

[00:44:17.500] - Speaker 1
There's a way that you have a mission statement that can be really powerful in certain ways. And then at some point, so don't be evil. I think it was It was a charismatic mission statement. I don't know exactly what it meant, but what I imagine meant in the Google of the early 2000s is we're not just going to squeeze out every last dollar in every way possible. There are all these things we can do that are questionable, but we don't need to do them. We don't have to be able to have a great company. And then at some point, it either gets high project where maybe it becomes a vehicle for incredible corporate political correctness, where if the company is not politically correct, it gets redefined as evil. And so it becomes this weapon for all sorts of fights inside the company. Or there are all these ways that if you want to criticize Google, you can say it's being evil in some way, and then it becomes this all purpose excuse for self-destructing. So there's something about the motto that was very charismatic in the world of 2005 and that maybe a decade later had somehow deranged.

[00:45:37.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the idea of retiring that particular slogan just seems wild.

[00:45:43.100] - Speaker 1
I think they retired it a while ago, though.

[00:45:45.290] - Speaker 2
Because it's so open and poetic what it means, it can mean a lot of things. But to make the active statement, We're going to take away, Don't be evil from our company, it's just a wild idea.

[00:45:59.150] - Speaker 1
Again, it's always easy It's easy to say these things with 20/20 hindsight, but I would say with 20/20 hindsight, you should have thought about that before you came up with a slogan like that. You should have realized that it's a very dangerous slogan because maybe you're setting yourself up to an impossible standard. You're like a minister in a church, and it's probably a good thing to be a preacher. It's probably a really tough standard. Again, It's easy to say with 20, 20 hindsight, probably much harder to say ex ante.

[00:46:37.810] - Speaker 2
You sold PayPal to eBay. Were there other suitors?

[00:46:41.880] - Speaker 1
It was a very strange dynamic because there was only one natural buyer and one natural seller. Because if something like 70% of our volume was on eBay, someone else bought it, eBay could always threaten to shut us off. I see. And then at the same time, there were obviously enormous synergies with eBay because most of their users were still not using PayPal, and so they could push it to them, and there would be an enormous lift for the PayPal If you have a merger transaction in which there is only one seller and only one buyer. And then if you have a merger transaction in which there is only one seller and only one buyer, and then if you say, well, we ended up being one and a half billion, But let's say our next best offer would be 500 million, and let's say it's worth three billion to eBay, up to three billion or more to eBay. And then if we'd sell for 500 and they pay up to three billion. The question is, how much would the price go for? And I think the theoretical answer is that it's completely arbitrary and completely up to the relative negotiation skills of the two parties.

[00:47:58.510] - Speaker 1
And so it's the combination that's extremely valuable and extremely hard to negotiate.

[00:48:04.800] - Speaker 2
What do you think happened to eBay since then? Because it felt like I used eBay all the time, and somewhere along the line, me and everyone I know stopped using eBay, but I don't really know why.

[00:48:17.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's a complicated story. It was certainly, if you look at it as a market capitalization of the largest internet companies, I want to say, initially, the biggest one was Netscape. From 1997 to 2001, the biggest pure internet company was Yahoo. In 2001, eBay overtakes Yahoo. 2005, it gets overtaken by Google. So eBay was the largest pure Internet company for four years. It probably, during that time, had a market cap two or three times as big as Amazon, which in some ways is the one that really replaced it on e-commerce. Yeah, they're All sorts of things one could say. The eBay site had this auction format, and then an e-commerce site is a commodity product, which you sell a whole bunch of things. And then there were things that involved elements of both on eBay, where it was these small businesses that would sell things, and not everything they sold was unique. And then somehow the auction format was valuable, but for only a pretty small part of e-commerce. Maybe it's good to auction stamps or rare coins or things like collectibles. But then once you shift to books or maybe old rare used books are collectibles, but then Most books are not in that category.

[00:49:48.000] - Speaker 1
Probably there was some way where the product should have iterated a lot and become a lot more of an e-commerce site. I think they didn't have the vision to do that. It was working well enough. It was profitable. It just worked. But there was a limit to how much it scaled. And there was a weird way that the eBay business of the early 2000s, it was a hybrid of this really valuable, let's say, auction monopoly and this bigger but more competitive e-commerce business. And it was not as big a monopoly as it looked. It was a valuable core monopoly and then a big more competitive business. Somehow, they didn't think that through and navigated as well as they could have, probably.

[00:50:36.630] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of the book, Zero to One. How did it come to be?

[00:50:40.520] - Speaker 1
It was a series of lectures I gave. I'm giving me various speeches about the stuff for years and various perspectives on how to start companies and various lessons I learned. Then in the spring of 2012, I did a big Stanford class with hundreds of kids. It was just, I'm going to just teach Everything I've learned about starting businesses in one class.

[00:51:02.820] - Speaker 2
How did you prepare for that?

[00:51:05.030] - Speaker 1
In retrospect, it was actually quite uneven. Some lectures were really good, some were more mixed. About half of them, I just had material that I did and put into these pretty good PowerPoint formats. There were a bunch of other ones where I just had conversations with people in Silicon Valley, and a lot of them were these high-profile people. A lot of them weren't that interested in saying anything controversial. There were parts of it that were fairly uneven, but there was a lot of material. One of the people in the class was guy Blake Masters, who I became friends with. He posted it on the internet, which was a good format because if someone else takes notes and It's a good way to post them. There can be all sorts of mistakes in it. You don't need to double check it. But you got hundreds of thousands of readers. And then that was a compelling pitch to the publishing house. That's interesting. So many people had read it on the internet even more people would buy the book. And I had all these charts, and it was one of the charts I came back to over and over.

[00:52:06.040] - Speaker 1
I had a zero to one was on an X axis, and one to N was a Y axis. So on the X axis was extensive growth, where you do more of the same. And then on the Y axis, the vertical axis was, intensive growth, where you do something new. And then somehow, Blake came up with this idea of zero to one as the title. It's a great title. And then, as soon as As soon as I heard the title, it's okay, the title is good enough. We have to just do the book. It's creation from nothing. It's like God creates the universe in a zero to one move. And so somehow it is like the creative act Yeah, it's very similar. And then it has this computers, zeros and ones. It has this world of bits vibe to it. It's just two numbers that are the most basic. We sold a crazy number of books in China. It somehow got pushed.

[00:53:02.170] - Speaker 2
That's interesting.

[00:53:03.180] - Speaker 1
I have all sociological things, but we published in fall of 2014, and I did a two-week book tour in China in 2015. It somehow got pushed by the Communist Party like crazy. And since then, it's been semi-deplatformed. That's interesting, too. But we're selling, I think we sold maybe a million and a half copies in China, on which I got paid royalties. And there are all these interesting cultural cuts you have on different societies. So there's probably something I want to say maybe it's specific to China, but it's where you often... You have these categories of things that are numerically coded. It's like the threefold way of the Tao or the Gang of Four.

[00:53:44.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah, 64 hexagrams of the Echec.

[00:53:47.730] - Speaker 1
You have these numbers that are very important. And so somehow it was a very Chinese book because we had two numbers in the title, but it was an extremely non-Chinese book because as far as I can tell, the numbers zero and one almost never get used. Because the way the numeric category thinking goes is you have categories of... It has to be at least two in a category, to have a group and to abstract about the group. It's almost like reasoning starts with the number two or three.

[00:54:24.410] - Speaker 2
If China continues to build itself based on imitating what happens in the States, your book would be a died book to what happens in the States, so it would resonate.

[00:54:34.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Although, paradoxically, of course, my book was also about how one shouldn't imitate, how you should do new things, and how you should think for yourself. I think one of the ways it resonated in China was that the question of should China just imitate or should it do something new was already a very acute question in 2015, 2016. The argument that China should just imitate the West is, I'll get these numbers somewhat garbled, but the nominal GDP is one-fifth, one-sixth per capita of the United States. If you just copy the US. There's so much room to catch up. You don't need to do anything creative. And this is the boring part of the globalization story that in some ways, the developing world to become the developed world, it just needs to copy. You don't need to come up with new things. You just need to somehow transpose Western institutions and Western knowledge and Western technology. And if you can just copy it, there should be a lot of catch up in that. And then there's always some intuition that maybe there are limits to Western style growth. Maybe if everyone has a combustion engine car, there's not enough.

[00:55:53.070] - Speaker 1
There's enough oil for that in the US, but there's not enough oil for eight billion people. And so you need to have electric vehicles if everyone's going to have a car. So I think that was already a very acute debate behind closed doors in China somehow, was this question, can we just copy, which is the straightforward thing, or do we need to do something new? In some ways, of course, Japan had been the society that in important ways had just copied in the '70s and '80s, and then it worked incredibly well. And then at some point, it hit a wall. And so if you do as well as Japan, that's pretty good. But you're still going to hit a wall. Is China like Japan in 1970, where it has another 20 years of copying, or is it like Japan in 1995, where it's hit a wall?

[00:56:41.500] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of Japan post-World War II.

[00:56:47.180] - Speaker 1
I've spent a moderate amount of time there. It's obviously, in some ways, this society that copied the West like crazy. And then in some ways, the forms also stayed very different from the West culturally. I probably always approach these things through somewhat of an economic lens. There was some manufacturing, export-oriented growth model that Japan was able to perfect and to do incredibly well at.

[00:57:22.610] - Speaker 2
Mainly Toyota?

[00:57:24.160] - Speaker 1
Well, it was Toyota. I think it started with all sorts of silly games, and then eventually it moved up into small cars and then more luxury cars. There was a big semiconductor part to this. All kinds of very complicated industrial machinery. Of course, there was a pre-World War II history, too, where you have the Meiji restoration in the late 19th century, and somehow Japan radically modernized incredibly fast in the 19th century. It was one of the very few societies that wasn't simply overwhelmed by the West in the 19th, early 20th century. It was very traditional, but somehow they were able to turn it to radically transform. Commodore Perry shows up in Tokyo Harbor, 1850s or whatever that is, and It's been this closed society for almost 200 years. Then within 20, 30 years, it radically transforms. It also advances on the military side very quickly. It's 1905, where they defeat Russia. Wow, Japan, by 1905, is strong enough to defeat one of the great European powers. And then, yeah, it obviously goes haywire with the fascism and the militarism in the '30s and '40s. But then after World War II ends, There is some way the energy gets channeled in this relatively peaceful but aggressive modernization.

[00:58:55.580] - Speaker 1
It ends up being incredibly competitive. It violates every free trade theory one would have because it's super mercantilist. You have all sorts of effectively, you have massive tariffs in Japan on any goods that get produced outside of Japan. And then culturally, people don't buy them. And so there's a way the consumer standards of living are relatively low. It's this unbelievably competitive machine. And in some ways, there are these processes they do better, where it becomes more efficient and smoother functioning. And then somehow it somehow hits a wall in the '80s and '90s. Again, maybe the zero to one prism I'm tempted to give on it is that there's some point where they more or less caught up with the US, but then they needed to do something new. And it was just not geared towards innovation at all. It was process innovation of the sort where you build a more efficient factory, but it was not inventing radically new things. Then maybe the globalization piece that worked for Japan, where you had the labor was cheaper, the environmental standards were more lax than in the US. You have this arbitrage. Then the Asian tigers start to apply the same to Japan, where it's cheaper to have a manufacturing plant in South Korea or Taiwan or Southeast Asia.

[01:00:29.960] - Speaker 1
And then by the 2000s, China does the Japan playbook against Japan. And so the manufacturing tradable goods, we build goods that you can trade globally, was extremely powerful. But it had this hidden problem because there were billions of other people who were paid even less that might eventually catch up with you. China wasn't necessarily going to just keep the Cultural Revolution and the mass insanity going forever. The Japan thing worked extremely well. It was the only country in the world doing it, but then it had some hidden problems with it. There's always a part of me that thinks something that went wrong in the US is that we destressed manufacturing a great deal. We have these incredible trade deficits, current account deficits, which doesn't seem like that good a way to run the economy. But the problem we don't have that Japan ran into is there's some way where the US has to compete much less directly with labor in other countries. People in the US, they're basically in these non-tradable service sector jobs. And there's there's some way in which the US is the most immune from global competition, which is good and bad things to it.

[01:01:55.950] - Speaker 2
How important is manufacturing for any country? Can you be successful country without a manufacturing base?

[01:02:04.600] - Speaker 1
It's very important in some dimensions. And the disturbing thought I have, it's very multidimensional, but I'll simplify this where maybe it's less important economically than you think, and it's more important militarily than you think. And so if you build ships and you have to compete with people in South Korea or in China or Vietnam, you're never going to make any money building ships. And so it's going to be economically not great. But then if you can't build ships in general, it probably gets very, very expensive to build ships only for your Navy. So, yeah, the crazy intuition I have is maybe in a global world where there's these massive differences in income and standards in different parts of the world, Globally traded manufacturing can be quite a tricky economic proposition, but it's very important militarily. And then that's where there are all these extremely odd dynamics in the relationship between the US and China. Economically, it probably is really efficient to have the iPhone factory in Shenzhen. If you try to move that to Wisconsin, it wouldn't work, and people wouldn't work for $2 an hour, and they wouldn't be as perfectionist, and there's all these ways.

[01:03:33.890] - Speaker 1
It just wouldn't work at all. Then there is this question, how much are we losing this geopolitical battle with China as a result to?

[01:03:43.850] - Speaker 2
How much is the markup on iPhones?

[01:03:48.370] - Speaker 1
It's a crazy amount. My intuition is it's something like 50 %. And so Apple makes incredible profit margins, and of course, all the services that get layered on on top of just the handset itself. It's probably wrong to simplify it into just two companies. But if you have Apple, which is the design and marketing firm, and you have Foxconn, which is the employees, 2 million plus people, and it's the manufacturing assembly firm. The market capitalization of Apple in 2011, when Steve Jobs passes away, is something like 200 billion. The Foxconn market capitalization is something like 100 billion. And you think of it as a like a duopoly of sorts. We have the design, branding firm, and you have the assembly manufacturing firm, and one's worth twice as much as the other, but they're roughly same ballpark. You fast forward to 2024, 13 years later, and I want to say Apple is about three and a half trillion, and Foxconn is barely over 100 billion. Apple's captured a lot. And what's weird is how little Foxconn has been able to capture it. Then the qualifier to this is maybe there are more bespoke parts that are further up the supply chain in China.

[01:05:06.000] - Speaker 1
Maybe the people who make the machines that Foxconn uses to assemble the iPhones, maybe the machine makers really make some money, or maybe there are other parts of the supply chain where people make money. But if you simplify it into just those two companies, it's simply a mystery to me why Foxconn has been able to extract slightly more value.

[01:05:26.400] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the difference between mysteries and secrets. It's from the book.

[01:05:34.960] - Speaker 1
Well, probably these words are all a little bit misused, but the way I use it in the book, a mystery is something that is just unknowable. Maybe there's some metaphysical mysteries about the nature of the universe that are deeply unknowable. And then a secret is something that's not yet known, but that is humanly knowable that we can figure out. And there's somebody who will be a first person to figure it out. And maybe it's a fuzzy line, what's a mystery, what's a secret. But from the point of view of the 16th century, the map of the world. It was still a mystery because no one knew it. But then at some point you have these explorers and you can be the one to figure this out. So geography and exploration, it was a thing to And then, of course, at some point, the whole world has been explored, and that's not a place to even look for secrets anymore. And then the question is always, what are things in the 21st century that are analogous to Christopher Columbus discovering the new world in 1492? What are the things that nobody knows, but somebody might be able to figure out?

[01:06:56.230] - Speaker 2
Because those are the breakthroughs.

[01:06:57.360] - Speaker 1
Those could be great businesses. That's where I think you will have fantastic breakthroughs throughs fantastic businesses, or at least, yeah, you're going to change our society, change the world.

[01:07:06.130] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the first Internet bubble popping.

[01:07:12.710] - Speaker 1
It's always hard to even tell these things in retrospect, 24 years later. But the Nasdaq peaked at something like 5,000 in March of 2000. It had probably gone up from 2000 to 5,000 in less than 18 months. And then it crashed something like 80 % over the next two plus years, and then gradually built its way back. And then all these individual stocks you can describe. I think it was a Every split adjusted Amazon was $113 a share in December of 1999. By October of 2001, it was down to five and a half bucks. Amazon went down 95 %. And then if you'd held onto it, you'd get back to this December '99 level at the end of 2009. So it took a decade just to get back to where you started. And then if you'd held on to it for another 15 years, you would have made 30 times your money. So you would have made 30 times your money from December '99. But if you bought it at the bottom, you would have made 600 times your money because it went down by one 20th, then it went up 20X, and then another 30X.

[01:08:23.500] - Speaker 1
One cut I've had on the bubble of '99, and this is a little bit retrospective, but I have had this for a while, was that in some sense, '99, March 2000, was both a peak of insanity and a peak of clarity. So there was a psychosocial mania, and Yet people had just lost their minds. And then at the same time, they saw with perfect clarity that the Internet was going to take over the world, that the new economy was going to replace the old economy. And so there was some way in which this was an extreme peak of clarity. And then B2C was business to consumer and B2B was business to business. And then the post bubble loss in 2001, 2002 was B2C meant back to consulting and B2B meant back to banking. And in some ways, you can think of the Bush '43 era, which starts right after the bubble bursts. And we went from bricks to clicks in the '90s. And then we went from clicks to bricks in the 2000s, real estate or bricks, B-R-I-C, Brazil, Russia, India, China, the old economy, emerging market story. And there was some way in which it looked like we went back to sanity in the 2000s, but it was just maybe that was just a giant detour for eight years.

[01:09:49.380] - Speaker 1
And then it was only the last 15 years that you had this slow build and what happened really did.

[01:09:56.230] - Speaker 2
So did it have to happen?

[01:10:00.910] - Speaker 1
I don't think it had to happen. I think it was a very natural thing for it to happen because if you can see that the internet is going to take over the world, but not too quickly.

[01:10:12.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:10:13.810] - Speaker 1
It was more a question of time. There are some catastrophic approximations that come with that. And so you value it like it's going to dominate the whole economy, or do you value it like a bunch of it will go broke first, or the internet might take over, but the specific companies might be different. Yahoo and eBay might turn out not to be as dominant as they appeared. So the companies might change. Facebook didn't yet exist in '99. Google existed, but wasn't public till 2004. But yes, I'm tempted to give it that gloss because it was such a formative period for me because PayPal was '98 to 2000.

[01:10:51.940] - Speaker 2
And you lived through it.

[01:10:53.180] - Speaker 1
We lived through the bubble and the loss. And survived. We survived. So it was probably overly formative. And so I probably think about it too much. But the 2024 cut I have is maybe AI is like the Internet in 1999, where it's real, it's very big, it's going to change things, and it may still be a completely crazy bubble.

[01:11:19.010] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Silicon Valley bank crash.

[01:11:21.520] - Speaker 1
Silicon Valley is the only sector of the US economy that is extremely under leveraged, where there's very, very little Debt. Debt is always this more complicated product in a way than equity. One way to think about it is that if you're a tech company, early on, it's very risky. You invest as a venture capitalist, it's an inequity. Then later on, if the company succeeds, it's so wildly profitable, it never needs to borrow any money. I believe the tech sector as a sector is one where the companies have way more cash than they owe money in bonds or debt. They're very, very under levered as companies. Almost every other sector of the US economy, debt is a big part of the corporate structure. It's a big part of your structure of a bank has debt. A manufacturing company has debt. There's all these ways you have cash flows and you can borrow against the cash flows. Real estate, of course, is mostly dominated by debt with typically a much thinner tranche of equity. Silicon Valley is this unusual place that's extremely light on debt as a sector. And then maybe a cultural gloss on it is you have a bank that's called Silicon Valley Bank, and it tries to be part of the Silicon Valley culture.

[01:12:40.250] - Speaker 1
The self-image, I believe, at Silicon Valley Bank was that they were not bankers at all. And we don't know anything about debt. We're like these tech companies. We're going to copy our customers, and we're going to be as clueless about debt as our customers are. Even though Silicon Valley Bank, it sounds like it's a technological bank, maybe it should roughly have the connotation, I don't know, Bank of Nigeria or something like this, where it is a completely clueless bank, and you know nothing about the stuff. You don't know what's going on. And so that's roughly my understanding of why it was run in this unusually risky, cowboy-like way, because they were copying the tech companies, and it would be a low status thing in a tech company to understand debt too much. And somehow, that should not have been true on the level of Silicon Valley Bank, but I think they got swept up in the mania. They wanted to be like Google or something like that.

[01:13:40.880] - Speaker 2
Where do you think it's likely to be the next Silicon Valley on the planet? Can there be another?

[01:13:50.190] - Speaker 1
Man, this is like the multi-trillion dollar question. There are obviously all these countries that would like to have it or states that would like to have It's been very hard to engineer. There's a strange history of Silicon Valley where a lot of it came out of defense spending in the '50s and '60s, but then somehow it was also part of the hippie counterculture, and then at this point, it's pretty divergent from both of those. I would say I have for a long time been in the camp that there should be ways to build tech companies outside of Silicon Valley. And then it has also It has been quite difficult. I remember a talk I gave at Stanford back in 2005, and it was entitled, Where Do You Find the Next Google? So it's a search problem. We're searching for the next Google as an investor. And my answer was, it's It's very hard. It's a very hard search problem. It's very valuable. I think there is a 50% chance you will find it within a five-mile radius of this auditorium where I'm giving the talk, which I'm not getting the numbers right, but I want to say it's like one millionth of the surface area of the planet.

[01:15:01.350] - Speaker 1
That's why. I'm reducing it by six zeros. But there's a 50% chance you will find it within a five mile radius of this talk I'm giving at Stanford in 2005. And then in retrospect, I would say the next Google was Facebook, and it was located 1.7 miles by bike, 1.8 miles by car from where I gave that talk. I was already involved in it. I didn't think of it that way at the time at all. And then the updated version that I've been tempted give over the last decade is there's less than a 50 % chance it's within a 100-mile radius. There's better than 50, 50 chance it's somewhere outside of Silicon Valley. I still don't know if that is true because there are these network effects, there's this know-how, there's this capital in Silicon Valley, there's a scale, and there's an argument that maybe it gave Silicon Valley a small but decisive advantage. So the internet was supposed to get rid of the tyranny of place, and yet it all happened to first approximation. You had Microsoft and Amazon were in Seattle, but to first approximation, so much of it happened inside of Silicon Valley.

[01:16:13.710] - Speaker 1
There's an argument I've made that maybe at some point the network effects can shift from being positive to negative. You have positive network effects. We have the wisdom of crowds or you're connected with all these people and you have these positive externalities and you communicate and you get ideas. And then maybe there's a point where network effects become negative and the wisdom of crowds becomes the madness of crowds. And it's dominated by groupthink or political correctness or bubbles.

[01:16:40.380] - Speaker 2
That would be the argument against the universities now.

[01:16:42.670] - Speaker 1
Against universities or even maybe the Silicon Valley version is that it's gotten so expensive and so competitive that you have more space to be creative in LA or Austin or somewhere very different. But then I don't know whether that's just wishful thinking on my part or deep reality. There's probably a lot of it that is specific to the vectors of technology. Tell me what the next technology will be, and maybe that tells us something about the geography. So consumer Internet was this thing where small differences made an enormous difference. You had to be extremely fast. The advantage Silicon Valley had were of decisive importance. Maybe in 2020, 2021, it looked like crypto was going to be this next big thing. There was something about crypto that was decentralized and also decentralized geographically. People could build the crypto protocols. In some ways, it was better to do it outside the US. If crypto would have dominated all of tech, maybe that would have been a more distributed type of technology. We fast forward to 2024, it looks like AI is the next technology. That one It seems concentrated in a way that I find disturbing inside Silicon Valley.

[01:18:05.410] - Speaker 1
The big AI companies are Google, Facebook, NVIDIA, of course, with the chips in Silicon Valley, OpenAI, Anthropic, the big large language models, new companies, startup, pure companies are all in Silicon Valley. The AI engineers are all in Silicon Valley. So the geographic mapping on AI is that it's perhaps even more concentrated in Silicon Valley than the Internet was, let's say, in 1999.

[01:18:33.910] - Speaker 2
How has moving from Silicon Valley to Southern California impacted your life?

[01:18:40.120] - Speaker 1
Southern California is such a more pleasant place to live than Northern California. California, and the weather is better. The real estate is somehow vastly better. Silicon Valley is probably the worst real estate place in the world if you adjust for wealth. Like, If someone makes X dollars, what quality of a place do they live in? And it is probably the absolute worst in the world. There are some pieces of it I do miss. I think there's a way you have a lot of really talented people in Silicon Valley. There's a part of it that felt to me like it was exhausted and had gotten more on the madness of crowds and the wisdom of crowdside back in 2018 when I moved to Southern California. But it's complicated. I don't think it can be fully replicated.

[01:19:34.770] - Speaker 2
What's the etiquette in Silicon Valley between the companies and players?

[01:19:44.770] - Speaker 1
I think the etiquette is better than it is in the entertainment industry. I think in both industries, people pretend to be nice to each other. I think in Silicon Valley, the niceness, the trying to find ways for people to work together are, I wouldn't say it's all fake in Southern California, but it's fairly authentic in Silicon Valley. You never know who's going to succeed. There's been a part of it that's been this massive gold rush for decades. And if you're too zero sum, if you get too difficult to reputation, that seems like a very, very suboptimal strategy in a Silicon Valley context. I do think probably there are ways it changes with the scale of the players. And so the Silicon Valley of the 1990s, it wasn't all small companies, but it was not dominated by really big tech company. The one big tech company of the '90s was Microsoft, but it was far away in Seattle. And you now have these companies that are on a truly enormous scale. And I think probably the social graph at a place, I'll pick on Google, at a place like Google, it's a very internal world. Most of your friends will be other people who work at Google.

[01:21:09.950] - Speaker 1
Maybe Apple is even more this way. It's somehow- It's a bubble. It's somehow surprisingly less connected to the rest of Silicon Valley. In that sense, maybe Southern California, maybe the entertainment industry in Southern California actually is more network than Silicon Valley is at this point.

[01:21:29.370] - Speaker 2
What is Palantir?

[01:21:32.100] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm always tempted to just give a J. R. R. Tolkien literary reference where it's this round orb originally built by the elves. It's this very powerful device that enables you to make sense of things in far away places and maybe even different times. It's a very important in the Tolkien Lord of the Rings, which is one of my favorite books as a kid. It's a very important plot device for all sorts of reasons. I could go through, but it ultimately gets used for good, even though it can also get misused. I was just talking fans and it was this company we started in 2003, 2004. It was all these contradictory motivations we had to a libertarian, deep state adjacent company to help the CIA find terrorists in ways that wouldn't violate Civil Liberties as much as they would if they were just relying on Luddite, low tech, highly intrusive airport security machines and making everyone take off their shoes and stuff like that. That was the founding vision. That was this James Bond type company that- Is it still that? It's a decent amount of work with intelligence agencies, with the military. Probably about roughly half the revenues are government-related, which is, I think, always a very difficult place to work, but I also think it's an important one.

[01:23:00.520] - Speaker 1
I'm this anti-government libertarian. And so the glass half empty version is you should never work with the government because it's endlessly frustrating. And then the glass half full or glass one-tenth full version is that there is so much room for improvement, and there are so many ways that maybe the government is the single institution that could be most improved by technology. And then I always define technology as doing more with less. And so the Palantier version would be, can we have more security with less intrusion into Civil Liberties? And that's what a technological solution would look like. Whereas the standard way these ideological debates are grooved is more with more, which I'll say would be the draconian Dicccheni security state versus the less with less, the 20th century Luddite ACLU approach. My view is you had to try to find a third way. I worry that if you frame it as the Luddites versus the totalitarian tech people, the totalitarian tech people Cheney will always beat the ACLU after you get a terrorist attack. Part of the poundier hope is we could... It was in the aftermath of 9/11 that we started it, and the hope was we will stay a free country, or a relatively free country.

[01:24:30.800] - Speaker 1
It's important to prevent these attacks from happening because after they happen, the Civil Liberties always go out the window.

[01:24:38.550] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the connections in general between the government and Silicon Valley. How deep are the ties?

[01:24:46.390] - Speaker 1
I think historically, they were very deep in the '50s and '60s. I think they are quite decoupled in general in the post-Cold War era, let's say, post-1989. Washington, DC, and Silicon Valley are very different places that feel very different. Dc is this functioning middle class city from the middle of the 20th century. That's the land, the time for God or something like this. Dc is too focused on government. Silicon Valley, even with all the liberal political biases, the center of energy is completely on the private sector. It's fairly low on the civic side, even in extremely liberal San Francisco. It's just the city governance doesn't work. Nobody cares about it. Nobody thinks about it. So somehow, politics, governance, getting these things to work is something that people in Silicon Valley don't think about very much. You can almost say that this escape into virtual reality, into the internet, to the world of bits, the world of atoms got regulated and governed, and it governed and overregulated, especially in California. And so in a way, the natural thing for an entrepreneur or someone who wanted to make a difference in the world to do was to escape into this world of virtual reality, into the world of bits or Southern California is more entertainment, and all these parts of our world that interface with, I don't know, city zoning laws and building a house or the school schools or all these things have maybe gotten more neglected in California than elsewhere.

[01:26:36.270] - Speaker 2
What sources do you trust for news?

[01:26:40.390] - Speaker 1
I have a Bloomberg terminal, so I end up getting a lot of my news from there. I always think I should not trust them at all because it is like just this official center left establishment voice. I get physical copies still of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times Times. I think there's all these interesting ways to read the New York Times where it's like there's probably some way to read Pravda. And so I'm probably this is too confident, but I trust my ability to decode the New York Times and to actually figure out things about the world from the extremely distorted way they talk about it.

[01:27:21.930] - Speaker 2
What's the most controversial idea you believe?

[01:27:26.930] - Speaker 1
Probably way too many, but I don't think idea is always being controversial. I certainly don't think that makes them correct. I do have this intuition that when there are things we can't talk about or that are somehow blocked, it doesn't necessarily make them right, but there's something about those things that It's interesting to think about, but I don't know. I don't even know what's controversial at this point. The COVID vaccine. I got vaccinated three times, and I don't think I should have gotten vaccinated. I don't think it works in any way. It probably has all these bad side effects. And three, four years ago, that seemed too crazy and too unscientific for me to question the vaccines. And now that doesn't even seem controversial.

[01:28:11.890] - Speaker 2
What have been the most interesting things you've seen in anti-aging? Going forward, what are you most excited about regarding anti-aging?

[01:28:25.080] - Speaker 1
What's crazy about it is how we're somehow not trying enough It's a very uncomfortable topic because we're probably not making progress quickly enough that the two of us will live forever. And then, psychologically, there are all these ways. It's so uncomfortable to think about, but it's crazy how we've almost given up on making progress. I think anti-aging biotech, generally, it should be this area where there should be so much innovation There's so many things we should be able to do. When I look at it, my frustration is, man, we made some progress in cancer, really modest. We had almost no progress on things like dementia, 40 or 50 years. I don't think these things are unsolvable mysteries. I think there should be ways really to make progress. I always find it shocking that we're as stuck as we are. I shifted to starting to We used some of the Ozempic Mounjaro things a year and a half ago. It seems powerfully effective. There probably are all sorts of side effects that don't know what the trade offs are. But I think there's probably some very basic stuff like getting your diet under control that we can do.

[01:29:50.520] - Speaker 1
It's not a panacea, but it's a big lift. Then I'm always interested in the psychological question, if eating healthy or not eating too much. Diet means both a healthy diet, but a non-excessive diet in particular. If it's that straightforward, why are we so blocked from it? And then the meta-level psychology theory I often wonder is where you know what you're supposed to do, and that almost becomes the excuse for not doing it. There probably are some esoteric secrets that need to be discovered and that could be discovered and that we're stuck on. And then there is, I think, a lot A lot of relatively basic things that we know and just are, I want to say, psychologically blocked.

[01:30:38.020] - Speaker 2
In the book, you talk about diversification in business as a bad strategy. Tell me about that.

[01:30:47.640] - Speaker 1
Well, it was meant in the context where, it's not a perfect metaphor, but I often think a good startup is it's like a sports team. It's different from a sports team because it's not like a set game you're playing. But for a sports team to be effective, it really is this hole is greater than the sum of its parts. The people, there are these deeply complementary skills. You respect one another. It's not everyone's a clone, but there's a lot of complementarity. You have vigorous debates, but then you also find a way to get in sync and on the same page and move on. It's not an endless debating society. If you define diversity as difference for its own sake, that's probably not quite the right metric.

[01:31:44.010] - Speaker 2
In investing also, you talk about not having a diverse portfolio, but focusing on the area that you think is the area of growth.

[01:31:53.120] - Speaker 1
Yes. I always think there aren't that many great ideas. You could say, here 20 pretty good ideas, and maybe there's a nihilistic reality where they're all pretty good, but you can't differentiate them, and then you should invest in all 20. But I think that's too nihilistic. Maybe the truth is you can actually figure out, here are the one or two that are the best, and you should concentrate on those. It's uncomfortable because it feels really risky. But actually the synonym, maybe diversification sounds good, but it's really synonymous with nihilism or not thinking.

[01:32:34.780] - Speaker 2
Hedging your bets.

[01:32:36.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it sounds like you're hedging your bets, but you're being willfully, ignorant or oblivious, and you actually know more than you think you do. You just somehow bring that out. In the corporate culture, there are definitely ways that I think having vigorous internal debates are very important. Then there also are ways that it's good for people to be aligned on a product or some transcendent mission. Early on at PayPal, this is a silly example, we like to say that we were a Star Wars, not a Star Trek company. And Star Trek is communists because you have the transporter, and you have no material shortage, and there's no money in the world of Star Trek. We have a new payment system. And then Star Wars starts with Han Solo, and he needs to get some money to pay off these debt COs. And we were a a Star Wars company, not a Star Trek company. Maybe it's not necessary for everyone to like Star Wars more than Star Trek, but-It worked. It worked, and it would have been odd in the PayPal context if someone was a crazy Star Trek fan.

[01:33:43.210] - Speaker 2
Do you invest in anything outside of tech?

[01:33:47.160] - Speaker 1
I end up doing a lot of smaller investments where I just find it interesting what the person is doing or I think it's worthwhile. But yeah, the place where I'm really anchored is tech. At times it feels extremely overvalued, but I don't know what else moves the needle. I keep having this diversification thought that I, on some level, should diversify out of tech. In theory, that's the diversification portfolio. Then when I try to concretize it, I have no idea how to do it. It's very likely it would be much worse. I end up never... In theory, I should do it in practice. I don't.

[01:34:28.540] - Speaker 2
Can hardware be tech?

[01:34:30.380] - Speaker 1
I always think technology simply means a place where you're innovating and where you're doing new things. If we sat here in 1967, the year I was born, technology would have meant computers, but it also meant the green revolution in agriculture, and it would have meant supersonic aviation, and rockets were tech, and new medicines were tech. And that reflected a society where there was progress and advancement on many different fronts. And then an odd thing that's happened the last 30 years is that tech has collapsed to becoming synonymous with IT, with software bits, internet, mobile Internet, and even semiconductors. Maybe there's been a return to that with the AI chips. But for 30 years, we're seen as somehow peripheral to the software tech story. I would hope that the definition of technology would broaden out again again, because that would be indicative of our society advancing on many fronts versus this incredibly intense but incredibly narrow cone of progress we've had around the world of bits, where the world of atoms has been inert, regulated, too hard to do things in.

[01:35:49.100] - Speaker 2
Who do you see yourself in competition with now?

[01:35:54.560] - Speaker 1
I'm always bad at these self-reflective questions. I I don't want to ever be in competition with anybody is my reflection. It was a zero to one essay that I had where it was, Competition is for losers. If you want to compete like crazy, if you want Darwinian competition, nature, bear, red, and tooth, and claw, you should open a restaurant. Capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is about accumulating capital. A world of perfect competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away. And I think from the inside, you're not always perfectly self-aware of these things, but to the extent I am, I try to avoid it like crazy. That's great. The people I think of as extremely successful as more successful than myself are the ones I want to compete with the least. So I don't know. The person on this planet I would want to compete with less than anybody would be Elon Musk. That just sounds like a A recipe for losing.

[01:37:01.690] - Speaker 2
If competition leads to competing away profit, how does the luxury and fashion market fit into that idea?

[01:37:15.410] - Speaker 1
I don't know much about it. And I think there's this very mysterious thing called brand, which when you get a brand, you get some pricing power. And then it is a somewhat mysterious process how brands get created or strengthened, get monetized. Occasionally, they also get eroded. And for the most part, I think of fashion as centered on this extremely mysterious thing called branding. It obviously, on some level, it works, and on some level, I suspect there are some interesting secrets that people who've succeeded in that industry could say about what they did or how it worked that are very, very divergent from the official story. And then for good reason, they would not tell us those secrets because that probably would be the surest way to erode it. And then there's probably a time dependent thing where there are ways to create new brands in the '70s and '80s, and it's maybe very, very different today.

[01:38:28.120] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the age of most of the founders of successful unicorns.

[01:38:33.500] - Speaker 1
I think all these things are massively contested, and probably are all these different ways to skew the data, even on something as seemingly basic as the age of the founder. I'll do the pro-young and the anti-young person argument. So I think the consumer internet companies were founded by people who were quite young. Typically, Typically in their 20s, I was 31 years old when I was one of the PayPal cofounders, and I think 31 was relatively old to start one of those businesses. The other three people I started PayPal with were 23. Maybe that was a little bit on the younger side, but let's say mid 20s was probably a good, reasonable age. Now, the anti-young person thing that I believe is that there is something where where an entrepreneur, you're good at a range of different things. You have people skills, you have ideas about where the world's going. And a lot of these skills actually are ones that get developed over a long time period. And the great entrepreneurs at 45 are better than at 25. I don't know how old Zuckerberg is now. I think maybe he's 43, 44 years old. And I think a 44-year-old Zuckerberg is way more talented than a 19-year-old.

[01:40:01.730] - Speaker 1
And so in that sense, the 44-year-old is better than the 19-year-old, but he's not available. He's busy with Facebook. And so there's a selection effect where if you started a great company, most of the time it made sense to keep running it. The PayPal story is actually an unusual one where it got short circuited and all these people started new companies started over. And then if you compare the 19 year old Zuckerberg With, let's say, a 44 year old professional CEO you would bring in where there have been four or five semi-failed companies in the past, that's much less clear. I think empirically, It seems to favor people who are quite young, but maybe it's just a selection effect.

[01:40:51.510] - Speaker 2
Why do you think boards for public companies tend to like to remove founders and put in operators in their place?

[01:40:59.920] - Speaker 1
I don't know if it happens as much in Silicon Valley anymore. This was certainly the way Silicon Valley operated in the '80s and '90s. In the '90s, the generational story was it was Gen-X, people like myself that started the companies in the '90s, and we got replaced by boomer CEOs. And so there was a... You can describe it as this professional management versus wild-eye founder, or you can describe in terms of some generational warfare in the '90s. At this point, not absolutely, but it has somehow the balance of power in tech has shifted more to the founders. They often get voting shares where they have more voting control. There's a lot that's worked to them. Even when they don't have voting control, I think Elon owns, I don't know, maybe 13, 14 % of the Tesla shares, and in theory, could be voted out by the other shareholders shareholders. But then there's been a lot of volatility that came with Elon, but you'd be out of your mind to get rid of them. And that's the story that has tended to dominate the There obviously are still some exceptions. At some point, the board got rid of Travis Klanek at Uber.

[01:42:22.710] - Speaker 1
Not sure that was a good idea. Yes, there were ways he was probably a very uneven person, and still, I wonder if they would have been much better off finding a way to keep him. But public companies, you can think of as almost extensions of the government. This is the way I always describe it when your company goes public. It's private. It's like private sector. Public is like public sector. When you go public, you have an IPO, an initial public offering, and you sell shares to the public. It's not just a small number of sophisticated wealthy investors. It is your 70 something grandma, and she has to be protected by the SEC. You have to have more disclosure, and then the CFO has to have perfectly accurate numbers. If he doesn't, she doesn't, you go to jail. The CFO is this important quasi-government actor. The accountants are, the lawyers are super important, the HR Department is important. And in some ways, the board has this quasi-governmental role. And again, the private sector is probably more geared to taking crazy risks.

[01:43:36.730] - Speaker 2
Move fast, break things.

[01:43:37.920] - Speaker 1
The public sector is more geared to risk reduction, and there's some balance, but the balance shifts radically. And it's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I often tell CEOs that when they take their company public, they should think of it as in part a government takeover that's happening. You're empowering the lawyers, you're empowering the accountants, you're empowering all these people who are quasi-acting on behalf of the government or on the rules, and they will have more power. And then there's some other set of people who maybe are the more creative people, the engineers, the product people, will have correspondingly less power.

[01:44:15.740] - Speaker 2
What do you think the government's good at?

[01:44:19.230] - Speaker 1
Let me frame it more negatively. I don't think pure capitalism is good at everything. I don't think every problem can simply be solved in a corporate context. Then there's the example I gave with manufacturing companies might not be great companies, but they're important if you want a military or there are all these things that have the nature of a public good, but that wouldn't necessarily be provided by the market. I'm always inclined to these deep government critiques where it's really inefficient. It often ends up being and the people who are empowered are the political actors and not the technocrats or not the people who are necessarily the best at doing these jobs. Then I suppose the pro-government argument is that We often don't have that great alternative to the government. If we're going to have a military, the government has to be heavily involved. It can't be probably just a pure private sector thing. There probably are ways governance can work better and less well. There probably are states in the US that are better governed, that are worse governed. There's states where it's pretty efficient. There's states where it's very bloated. So I think there are a lot of gradations that one could look at.

[01:45:48.980] - Speaker 2
How did you get involved in the Hokehogen lawsuit?

[01:45:52.870] - Speaker 1
I have all these complicated thoughts about media and the nature of media. It's extremely powerful. It's important as a communication channel. It's an important vector of technology, radio, television, internet. And then I think there also are dimensions of it that are not purely good in a first amendment absolutist sense, where speech is always good, more speech is always better. And there's a part of it that has This is always where I have this Girardian scapegoating intuition, where it's probably a celebrity part of the media, but there's a political part, where part of it is to put people on pedestals and to raise them up in order to tear them down, and that it is this deification and scapegoating cycle that the media is engaged in it. And you can say that a startup founder like myself, where the media helps PayPal in important ways when we were getting started, or if you're a Hollywood celebrity, and the media is essential to helping one break through. And then there's some point where we have to find some way to talk about that and also to talk about the ways in which it can come extremely resentful, destructive, and that it is almost like a hate factory or a scapegoating machine.

[01:47:32.330] - Speaker 1
And then I think there were new media forms that this also took on. Gawker Media started in the early 2000s as a transgressive gossipy blog. And it was very powerful because it looked like it had this authoritative, objective voice, even though on the psychology of it was just these extremely angry, underpaid, deranged writers. It would be wrong to say they were all individually sociopathic, but I think on an institutional level, it was deeply sociopathic. And then there were all these ways I ran into it, even in the tech industry, which again is not where there's a media dimension, but the idea had never been that it was mainly about the personalities of the founders or these larger than life characters or that if you were the CEO of a tech company, you were making a different trade off from being an A-list celebrity. There was some idea that you still should have had some privacy or something like this. There were all these ways that we started to encounter this very toxic Gawker blog. It went after very, probably one of my first friends it went after was Sean Parker, who was The Napster guy early on the Facebook board.

[01:49:03.240] - Speaker 1
And then there was a number of other people, ways they went after. There were ways they went after me. And then there was always a sense there was nothing you could do. It was basically, if they're beating up on you, you're supposed to bury your head in the sand and hope they get tired and move on to beat up on someone else. And at some point, I don't know, I started really thinking, Isn't there something you can do? And got pulled into financing Hulk Hogan in the litigation against Gacher. I think my friend Aaron DeSuza, who ended up being the day-to-day mastermind of the Gacher litigation. The way, I think, he initially convinced me to do it was something like, I made some categorical argument. It felt like there was nothing one could do. And then it was some triggering thing. He said, Peter, do you really believe there's nothing you can do? And this appeal to figuring out a way to regain some agency.

[01:50:03.810] - Speaker 2
Tired of being bullied.

[01:50:05.090] - Speaker 1
Tired of being bullied, tired of implicitly co-opting in the bullying of others because you're always hoping they move on and bully someone else. It doesn't feel good.

[01:50:15.490] - Speaker 2
None of it feels good.

[01:50:17.160] - Speaker 1
And then we somehow, what thing do you go after? You don't try to use libel as the main argument because you don't want Gawker to be simply conflated with the most elite media, where it's just this first amendment protection. And then we somehow stumbled early on on the Hulk Hogan case where they had posted a video of him having sex with his best friend's girlfriend, wife in the privacy of their bedroom. And so it was initially not about liable, but about privacy. The point I always make is, if you think about it in terms of constitutional law, there's There's a first amendment, which is the freedom of speech. But there's also a fourth amendment, which is where the right to privacy comes on. It is against unreasonable search and seizure. That means not just the police officer is not supposed to rumage through your whole car, your whole house without a search warrant. But it also means a private actor can't do this either. Then what does the right to privacy mean? It means something like when you get cameras in the late 19th century, it starts to mean something different from the 18th. And then there's a question, what does it mean in this age of the internet in the 21st century?

[01:51:35.790] - Speaker 1
And the case involved this core, the place where I think the Fourth Amendment should Trump the First Amendment. So that's the constitutional law version. But then I think the bigger story was that it's this very complicated trade-off between a media that's transparent and communication and one that It becomes a sociopathic hate factory. In my judgment, Gócher was extremely unbalanced and being more towards the latter.

[01:52:10.400] - Speaker 2
What have been the ramifications since then? What effect do you think it had?

[01:52:16.280] - Speaker 1
I think it was powerful, and I think we do live in a very different world from 2007, Gócher outs me as gay, even though this was already generally known, and Hogan wins the lawsuit, and Gócher gets bankrupted in 2016. But I think we're in a very, very different world, because in the world of the 2000s, early 2010s, the media was extremely They were extremely biased, but people didn't know that they were biased, and so they believed them. And today, the media is very biased, but it's known to be biased, and therefore gets discounted correspondingly. And I think is somehow, it can still be very damaging in certain contexts, but it's somehow shockingly less effective at the scapegoating violence it's trying to inflate. The gay version of this, I always say, is that what's the difference between outing and bullying? In 2007, when I was outed, it's this person is gay, and they have a psychological problem because they didn't want us to talk about it. Then in 2015, they did a similar story on the Condi Nass CFO, who's a Tim Geitner, the former New York Fed share's brother. But it got described as bullying in 2015, and Bullying is a story about someone who's gay, but the psychological question gets asked, not about the subject of the story, but about the reporter writing it.

[01:53:54.330] - Speaker 1
It was, what is your problem and why do you have to make this such a big deal? And why do you need to weaponize this in this way? And why are you such a hateful person? And this was in some way, in 2007, outing was considered acceptable. By 2015, bullying was not. That That's what I think was the big cultural shift that happened, where we've come to learn more about how the sausage making in the hate factory works. And in all these ways, it's working less well. I think that's the big cultural shift that to happen. I'd like to tell a story where I was a big part of this, but maybe that just is a way that the internet has matured.
