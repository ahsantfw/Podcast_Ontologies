[00:00:23.090] - Speaker 1
We've actually, at this point, built, believe, a total of seven, eight structures for Google, but started the conversation, I feel almost a decade ago at this point, and Google had been having a few false starts, but where they had treated their space, the new buildings, more like real estate than really thinking about it as an aspirational framework for their work. Considering that Google had somehow, back in the days with the ping-pong tables and snack bars, had become a little bit like the template for the Silicon Valley startup. Suddenly the reels were like, We should probably have great ambition. Larry Page, at the time, was back in the seat of CEO, and he said he wanted to really take an interest in this. We started working and, in a way, tried to map out the organizational diagram of how Google is structured, that the Googlers are grouped into teams, they are grouped into little villages of 150 people. Also, Google was, of course, pioneering their search, but they were also into quantum computing, and they were also into AI, and they were also into various kinds of hardware and cloud. They had a hard time predicting what was going to be their future and which aspects of their future was going to grow and how much.

[00:01:53.870] - Speaker 1
We ended up coming up with this idea of a two-layered structure. On one hand, let's say a series of platforms, the upper level, a series of platforms. Each platform, 150 people, roughly, which is the Dunbar number. Dunbar was a sociologist who somehow stated that the 150 group is a tribe, and that's roughly the amount of social relationships a human being can hold. So beyond 150, you need other systems of hierarchy, et and so on. Imagine we were creating, to start with the work environment for 3,000 people. So 20 platforms, each seating 150 people. And those platforms are pulled apart but colliding. So you can get from one platform to the next, to the next, to the next. But there's also spaces in between them that open to the levels below. And since they cover a large area, each platform is raised the height of a desk from its neighbors, so that if you look at it in an aggregate, it's almost like a stepping hill, so that the ones sitting in the middle are a little bit higher than their surroundings, so they're not fully entrenched or enveloped by everybody else. It's like a gentle stepping hill.

[00:03:17.210] - Speaker 2
What are the shapes of each of the platforms?

[00:03:19.610] - Speaker 1
They're like squares or rectangles. But they form a checker pattern of open and closed.

[00:03:25.190] - Speaker 2
Is the whole outer perimeter rectangular or square, or is it more-It's It's not like a squircle, somewhere between a square and a circle, but it's pixelated or faithful to the authorogonality.

[00:03:38.680] - Speaker 1
It's almost like, let's say, a very gentle pixelated hill that is in a form of a checker pattern. You always have openings to below. And below, you get more like a Medina where you have all the restaurants and cafés, all the meeting rooms, all the technical spaces. And that's also where people from the outside. So downstairs is very bustling social living, like a bazar, a public, exactly, open in all directions. And upstairs is more contemplative, focused, etc. And then the whole thing is covered by a series of what we call the canopy, a series of sheets, covered with photovoltaics on the outside with little cracks in between. We call them smiles. They look like smiles. That led in just the perfect amount of daylight everywhere. From upstairs, you have perfect amount of daylight. You still have shade.

[00:04:29.710] - Speaker 2
So in During the day, you don't really need lighting.

[00:04:32.920] - Speaker 1
You don't need lighting at all during the day. You have an abundance of shading still because the canopy also extends beyond the glass facades. You also have shaded areas on the outside. Every photon that hits the building is turned into power because the entire façade is what we've called dragon scales, like these shingled photovoltaic. I think we tested every photovoltaic panel that was on the market at the time and found a I have one from Switzerland called Sun Style that has a… It's texture glass. From the outside, it just looks like a beautiful material. It doesn't look like traditional photovoltaics.

[00:05:09.220] - Speaker 2
But it's put on like shingles, overlapping shingles.

[00:05:12.500] - Speaker 1
Overlapping shingles. What you see looks like scales or shingles. But it turns out that they're quite large when you get close to them.

[00:05:20.630] - Speaker 2
Does it look like a circus tent, would you say?

[00:05:23.190] - Speaker 1
But maybe more like an infinite expanse of Beduin tents. It has a wavy, scalopy surface. It's a pretty elegant form, like a shallow dome.

[00:05:36.630] - Speaker 2
When you're in it, do you feel like you're inside, or is it not clear that you're indoors?

[00:05:40.660] - Speaker 1
You have incredibly generous ceilings at certain points, although they do come down on the sides. But it actually is a little bit more like on a day with clouds where you do see patches of sky, but most of what's above you is white. That would be the vibe. Essentially, it gives you an incredibly free and flexible for 3,000 Googlers, but they're not lost in the vastness because they're actually part of this platform of 150. Then below you have more like this urban hustle and bustle of all the extra with functions. This system of canopies, we ended up building four of these canopies of various scales. Right now, it's where Google is doing all of their AI. Then adding on that, we We designed the headquarters in London, which is the most opposite urban environment you can imagine to Silicon Valley and Mountainview. There we took the same principles but had to squeeze it into essentially a 300, 1,000-foot long footprint. It's almost like, imagine the Google headquarters in London, there's almost like a skyscraper on the side. It's as long as the skyscraper is tall, and it's as tall as the skyscraper is wide. In a way, to achieve In a similar environment, we made the ceiling heights very tall and we hung all the meeting rooms and support functions under the ceiling.

[00:07:08.220] - Speaker 1
We have these very large open floor plates, 60, almost 200 feet deep, but with 40-foot ceilings where you get an abundance of light for all the Googlers. Then when they go to meetings and other support functions, they go up to the functions that are hanging under the ceiling in a way. Interesting.

[00:07:26.610] - Speaker 2
When you're in that space, what does it remind you of? Any other space you've been in your life, what would be the closest experience that feel like that space? It feel like a train station?

[00:07:35.960] - Speaker 1
The funny thing is because we were looking at typologies. When we started working with Larry and with Google in Mountainview, they had just acquired the two hangers at Muffet Airfield. They were very interested in this incredible freedom of the hangers. In that sense, the canopies somehow deliver some of that freedom. In London, maybe it's like a 19th-century train station, like with the big vaulted ceilings. Maybe some of the beautiful spaces for manufacturing that you know. Also, our own headquarters until recently in Copenhagen was inside an old Carlsberg factory. So tall ceilings, large windows, This generosity that allows for the accommodation of the unimagined. I think that's the feeling you get.

[00:08:25.400] - Speaker 2
You don't feel like you're in a box.

[00:08:27.580] - Speaker 1
No, I said it. Because one of the problems with, let's say, the office environments of the '70s, '80s, '90s. Cubicles. Exactly. They're so over-determined. Yes. Squat ceiling heights. They have everything. They have the system floor, they have the system ceiling. They have everything that on paper is flexible, but it is actually claustrophobic and restricting.

[00:08:54.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and all the same.

[00:08:55.590] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Then you need signage, and then you start having color coding so you can find your way around. So these spaces have this natural generosity of a little bit of excess, not in terms of luxury.

[00:09:09.120] - Speaker 2
But in terms of volume.

[00:09:10.350] - Speaker 1
In terms of volume, yeah, exactly.

[00:09:11.760] - Speaker 2
In the case of London, not necessarily footprint. It's more just space. You get the space above. Exactly.

[00:09:18.850] - Speaker 1
I also would say, almost in general, in architecture, there is one true luxury, and that's ceiling height.

[00:09:24.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Can ceilings be too high?

[00:09:28.350] - Speaker 1
Yeah, of course. But that It really happens. The madness quite often stops at a certain point. But I think that extra, let's say three, four feet, actually gives you fresher air, it gives you better acoustics, and it just gives you headroom. Even though it's sometimes a little bit difficult to argue for, because in the end, the real estate agent can sell the square footage, not the qubit.Not the volume, yeah.Exactly. But it is really the one thing to look for.

[00:09:58.310] - Speaker 2
Even in a New York office building, if you take out the dropped ceiling, there's probably another three feet.

[00:10:04.920] - Speaker 1
There's another three feet just sitting there.

[00:10:06.560] - Speaker 2
It feels great if you open that up.

[00:10:08.440] - Speaker 1
No, we've done it in all our spaces. Exactly. Then you have to look a little bit at some pipes, but I would much rather look at pipes than at a 60, like a two by two foot popcorn ceiling. Yeah.

[00:10:19.660] - Speaker 2
Anything between the design of that first Google platforms and then the experience of being in it that you you couldn't have known before you built it?

[00:10:34.530] - Speaker 1
One thing is the first one we did, we made it quite snug. We call them squomes, like square domes, whereas a normal dome would be a hemisphere.

[00:10:47.190] - Speaker 2
Like half a circle.

[00:10:48.580] - Speaker 1
Half a circle, exactly. Half a sphere. These, they had to fit within a more snug maximum envelope due to a CD planning and CD code. We thought maybe that was It's a bit tight, but it has the benefit that it's still very generous for a human height, and it does come down quite low on the sides. But it means that all the clear stories between the sheets of the photovoltaic canopies, the smiles, they become more like windows where you look out. Even though it is a little bit more snug, it actually feels very open because the clear The clear stories come so far down that they become windows for you.

[00:11:32.880] - Speaker 2
That's interesting.

[00:11:33.990] - Speaker 1
Whereas the next ones, we had a little bit more wiggle room in the zoning, so we could make them taller. We thought that would make it feel more generous and more open. But it does lift most of the clear stories out of eye height. As a result, the space feels... It is more generous, but it feels a little bit more contained.

[00:11:59.460] - Speaker 2
It feels It feels more like one space.

[00:12:01.690] - Speaker 1
It feels more like they're inside a dome. All spaces have qualities, but now that we know, the more snug one is maybe more successful.

[00:12:12.870] - Speaker 2
If you were to build another one, you might build it with the ceiling as well.

[00:12:16.090] - Speaker 1
I would definitely... Also, to be fair, and I think to the testament of Google, because also the bars were constantly set very high, we decided to, let's use the need to to accommodate Googlers to experiment with technical solutions. Let's do all the work. Basically, we ordered samples and mounted samples of every photovoltaic panel that was on the market. We also looked at... We visited Corning, the masters of glass that do the glass for the smartphones, found what they had. We found undulating glass, sheets of glass. We were looking at maybe making the entire canopy out of glass. We were beginning to realize that Also because Larry really thinks like an engineer, like physics, first principles. He kept saying it shouldn't be a problem to have everything out of glass. Glass is essentially just melted sand. It's an abundant material. If we get excess heat, heat is something we can use, so we can store it, extract it. We can also have deployable shades. We were looking at these origami satellite PV panels that NASA has been for deployment of satellites, for these almost like handkerchiefs that could become sunshading and then could disappear. We were testing these wild things.

[00:13:39.370] - Speaker 1
But at the end of the day, we also realized we need to break ground on this. We can't research until we die while Google is growing and growing and has no place to be. Then we were sitting under a canopy in Sicily midday, and for the love of God, we could not see anything on the screen, even though we were sitting technically in the shade, and we had to withdraw deep into inside. It became quite clear for this conversation that we should probably look at only letting in just the amount of light that we really want and need, because things might work in first principles, but practicality. Therefore, we created almost this idea that for the first building, these things are available to be deployed right away. For the second and third buildings, new technologies or materials that we've identified but that are not yet fully ready at scale. We decided making this tiered level of ambition. Then actually for the last building, they wanted a more modest budget. We ended up with these very large regular warehouses, but where the roofs are like parks so that all of the googlers sit on these tiered layers that are open to each other and open to the outside.

[00:15:01.850] - Speaker 1
You can actually walk and bicycle to every level, and then all the support functions are tucked underneath. We knew how we wanted the building to perform. We knew the parameters of unpredictable and flexibility and relationships, connectivity. But that didn't necessarily dictate one form. Let's say the building in London, the two latest buildings with the roof park in Mountainview and the canopies are radically different architectures, but they are all a physical way to accommodate a certain set of values or a certain set of parameters. The same philosophy or the same performance does not dictate the same form.

[00:15:54.680] - Speaker 3

[00:17:29.930] - Speaker 2
In terms of power usage, waste, how much of a building today can be totally self-sustainable?

[00:17:41.430] - Speaker 1
At the end of the day, the canopies themselves, they basically cover the entire building. They produce as much power that it is possible to extract from the sun. It's in the megawatts. The entire building is founded on energy piles because it's sitting on the edge of San Francisco Bay. You need to pile down to carry the building.

[00:18:07.250] - Speaker 2
I don't know what an energy pile is.

[00:18:08.870] - Speaker 1
Basically, when you're building in a muddy, swampy area, you need to drive piles into the ground to sustain it. In the absence of bedrock, a certain length of pile will give you enough friction along the pile to hold the building. In this case, you needed a lot of piles. Energy piles is that you take the same pile, but it comes with the infrastructure, essentially the tubes for a heat pump.

[00:18:38.690] - Speaker 2
It's like geothermal.

[00:18:41.020] - Speaker 1
It's like geothermal. It is the largest geothermal installation in North America, to my knowledge, or at least it was at its time. The beautiful thing of a heat pump is that you take a little bit of energy to run the pump, and then it multiplies that energy up to a factor It's five. So you essentially take excess heat in the summer and you store it in the ground and you bring it back up in the winter.

[00:19:07.610] - Speaker 2
That energy differential could either be used for heating or cooling-Exactly.as needed.

[00:19:13.800] - Speaker 1
As needed, exactly. In this case, the smart thing about the energy piles is that the infrastructure you need to carry the building becomes also the infrastructure to heat and cool the building.Incredible.It's a simple and elegant.Incredible. Then finally, the beautiful landscapes around the the various canopies, they strike your eye as beautiful parks. But then you realize that there's little wetlands and little running water, etc. All of it is actually a root zone garden. Let's say all of the rainwater that drops of the building is harvested from the roofs, and all of the black and gray wastewater from the building is let out through these root zone gardens. With the right selection of plants and the right mixture of gravel and rubble, etc, it is all cleaned first underground, and then finally it starts running. It's now so clean, and then it's let fully clean into the bay. Anyway, what looks beautiful as a landscape also performs beautifully as the cleaning plant for the whole building.

[00:20:19.880] - Speaker 2
It's a complete waste management system, the gardens. Exactly. Then the power is all coming from geothermal and the roof.

[00:20:29.350] - Speaker 1
Exactly. That's amazing.

[00:20:31.640] - Speaker 2
At one point in your career, was there a project turning greenhouses into living houses?

[00:20:37.090] - Speaker 1
We did it 20 years ago, and back in the days, we got the second prize in this competition. But we have actually dug it out of the archives and I'm working on it right now with a series of co-op housing groups in Denmark. The idea, it's a very simple idea. Because of the industry, let's say, the Danish and Dutch greenhouse manufacturers, they have developed a highly optimized way to create square acres of glasshouses to grow tomatoes and tulips. They can do them very efficiently and very inexpensively.Mass-produced.Mass-produced. Again, because they've optimized it for square acres and square acres of tulip fields, they minimize the material use. They have the most efficient sun-shading system. They have the most efficient automated ventilation by just a single turbo engine crank that lifts all of the glass roofs. So very inexpensively, you can get a quite sophisticated glass house. And because we're looking at Denmark in this case, Denmark is pretty rainy, it's pretty cold in the winter. It doesn't get crazy hot in the summer. So what you end up getting is dry construction. So inside this greenhouse, you have the climate of Spain.Wow.So then you can build- Always, all year round.

[00:22:05.560] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Then you can build with the timber, like stick build, like construction. The workers in dry air on the roof, They can walk around in T-shirts and build the homes. The homes don't have to withstand the harsh climate of Denmark. They only have to withstand the gentle, dry, warm climate of Spain.

[00:22:26.600] - Speaker 2
It's like a bubble community. Is that what you're describing?

[00:22:30.110] - Speaker 1
Yes. You end up having this strange climate zone, and back to the luxury of generosity and ceiling height in space. The homes inside the timber buildings become what would normally be the home. But then you have this winter garden around it that is the extension of the home, where it's not heated. In the winter, you might have to put on a sweater, but on a sunny day, it can get quite nice. In the summer, Of course, it'll get quite warm, but because of the shading and the ventilation, you can keep it cool. In that sense, you end up making cheaper housing that I think we're very close to carbon neutral, both on embodied carbon and operational carbon. That's the goal. That's where we want to be. But you also create more generous homes. It's the perfect example of hedronistic sustainability that the homes perform better for the They have less embodied carbon. They lose less energy, but they also increase the enjoyment and quality of life because you get these massive extra spaces in the form of the winter gardens, the buffer zone between what's inside and what's a cold November day outside. Then because it's so inexpensive, we did a benchmark.

[00:23:53.180] - Speaker 1
We tried to tender the same glass house for a normal housing contractor, and then to an agricultural the systems delivery. It was a factor three.

[00:24:03.810] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:24:04.560] - Speaker 1
Three times more expensive if it was for normal housing, even though it was the same specs. In that sense, it's trying to somehow hack the fact that agriculture has provided an optimized solution that is ready to use. Of course, they end up having a very different esthetic. These buildings, but they're elegant and beautiful and provide an amazing living space.

[00:24:28.960] - Speaker 2
What's an active in the building?

[00:24:31.930] - Speaker 1
I'm not quite sure what precise terms, but maybe as the opposite, there's a term called the passive house, which is a house that doesn't use any active means to heat or cool it. One way is to have thermal mass in the building so that when you have thick walls and thick slabs, they have thermal mass. Then they can absorb excess heat during the day and they can let it out during the night, for instance. Then passively, without any moving parts or any energy consumption, the building contributes to heating and cooling the building.

[00:25:10.660] - Speaker 2
That was probably how many buildings were built prior to electricity.

[00:25:14.530] - Speaker 1
Exactly. In the good old days. It's funny. A little story here because I think the situation we are in right now where our built environment is spending an incredible amount of energy to heat and cool it, to make it where they're comfortable to light it, et cetera, came from this moment when modernism happened. It happened at the same time as the advent of all of these new technologies. So you had mechanical ventilation. So you were independent of your proximity to the window. You didn't have to open the window. You could pump fresh air deep into the building and pump it deep, deep into the building. So you didn't have to be close to the windows. You could make the floor plans deeper and deeper. You also got electric lights, so you didn't have to be close to a window to see. So you could make the floor plans even deeper. And then you had air conditioning and central heating, so you didn't have to have a thick wall to protect from the heat outside or an insulated wall to protect from the cold outside. You could have floor to ceiling glass, and you could just crank up the AC or the-And the windows didn't have to be because you're controlling the temperature inside.

[00:26:33.100] - Speaker 1
Exactly. In that sense, you can say each technology represented a freedom, essentially a good thing. But it meant that the architecture-We went too far. Exactly. The architecture didn't have to do anything anymore because the machines could do it instead. Then the buildings became just a more and more neutral container of space. As a result, you got the international style of modernism, rectangular boxes extruded to whatever height. You also got the elevator, so you didn't have to walk the stairs to the fourth floor. You could take the elevator to the 40th floor. Somehow each technology was a freedom But the freedom meant that the architecture didn't have to perform the way it used to. As a result, the architecture got more and more a neutral container, covered in glass, extruded to whatever height, with A basement full of gas gostling machinery that was essentially tube feeding the building to keep it inhabitable and alive. You can say what we call building services is a mechanical compensation for the fact that the building is bad at what it is designed for, namely, accommodation of human life. In that sense, as a result, architects were beginning to notice that the international style of modernism, as the name suggests, meant that buildings were starting to look the same everywhere.

[00:28:03.510] - Speaker 1
You would go to downtown Milan and there would be a rectangular tower. You would go to Tangier in Morocco, rectangular tower. You would go to Chicago, rectangular tower. It used to be that when you travel around, the buildings would look radically different. There was a guy called Bernard Rudowski, who in the '60s made a very impactful show at the MoMA called Architecture Without Architects. He coined the term vernacular architecture. Architecture Without Architects, he was traveling around the Mediterranean, North Africa, China, and he was visiting all these beautiful, the white villages of Santorini, houses in Southern Spain that are dug into the hills or in Tunisia, like you know them from Star Wars, that are dug into the ground, so the thermal mass of the ground keeps them cool. He was describing the natural architecture as an architecture that was not esthetic nor academic, but empirical, that it had evolved over decades or centuries by the local population using the locally available materials to respond to the local climate to optimize living. He was, of course, reminding us of the esthetics of this local adaptation and diversity. But we've taken that as a building on that because it also responds to climate, right?

[00:29:29.890] - Speaker 1
We call it engineering without engines instead of architecture without architects that, in a way, try to use sophisticated technology that we have today to simulate and calculate and model the performance of a building. Then use that technology, that knowledge, to engineer the building, and then use that technology, that knowledge, to engineer the machines out of the building. The more in its extreme case becomes a passive building, that you're essentially putting a lot of effort into the design, into the choice of the materials, into the thickness of the walls, into the thermal mass, into the orientation of the windows, so that you become less and less dependent on active machinery to make the building inhabitable. It is a way to use the fact that we have incredible processing power and intelligence available to us now, that we can actually engineer the engines out of the building and get back to something that is more similar to what we find when we find a Tuscan villa where the thickness of the walls is so thick that the thermal mass keeps it cool on a hot summer day and where you have no more windows than exactly what you need to illuminate the space, but not so much that you get cooked during the day.

[00:30:45.690] - Speaker 1
Somehow that there is a promise that actually all this abundance of processing power technology can make our building vibe and less and less technical again.

[00:30:57.750] - Speaker 2
I think another difference is In ancient times, the location of the building was really important, both the positioning of the building, the direction it faced, how it interacted with wind patterns, was when they became the rectangle regular controlled boxes, there was less concern with the placement of the building because it didn't have to take advantage of the natural benefits of the space.

[00:31:26.230] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. It's this idea that all of these are technically freedoms But if the freedom just leaves you with a vacuum, you're left with boring and empty boxes.

[00:31:50.200] - Speaker 4

[00:33:15.240] - Speaker 2
Are there any materials that you would say you tend towards?

[00:33:20.930] - Speaker 1
I think each situation has a certain promise. So right now, a very simple way to lower the embodied carbon of a building is to build it out of timber. Not all climates are very conducive to timber. Many parts of the world have termites, for instance, and then your timber building is going to be short-lived. Other places, it will produce excessive tropical humidity. It can produce a fungus. But for instance, we built a building in the north of Norway that's the most environmentally friendly factory in the world. Entirely sourced out of a local pine inside. It means that this is a factory where they have machines and they produce furniture. But the walls, the ceilings, the beams, all out of timber, but not as a veneer or a finish. No, it's the bones of the building.

[00:34:18.370] - Speaker 2
Like a log cabin.

[00:34:20.660] - Speaker 1
Exactly. The building, the raw warehouse of it already is beautiful. On the outside, that timber is charred. That's a traditional method. By burning the surface of the wood, the bugs and the bacteria can't get to the wood. It's a way to preserve it.

[00:34:39.040] - Speaker 2
It makes it fireproof as well, I believe.

[00:34:40.750] - Speaker 1
Exactly. That's the funny thing. Another thing, timber in itself is actually a fire retardant because it takes an hour to burn through an inch of wood, where a steel beam, you need to clad it in drywall or fire protection because otherwise it turns soft and bends and collapses. Timber, you just have a little bit of a sacrificial layer of timber. Based on that, it became such a beautiful building. We're now doing the airport of Zurich, which will be the largest timber building on Earth. Wow. When you land in Zurich some years from now, you can almost smell the pine. It's all locally sourced pine. No piece of wood comes more than 2 hours by truck from a sustainable forest in Switzerland. It Again, it becomes like this cathedral of timber, the ceilings, the beams, the floors. But again, it's not an added veneer or like a-It's not decolour.Cosmetic coating, no. It's the structure. It's the heavy the age material that is the building, right? Sounds great. We're doing the architecture school in Kansas University. Similarly, everything out of timber. But that works in certain places. I think lately, I've been quite fascinated by By stone, because of course, in Denmark, we have no stone.

[00:36:04.390] - Speaker 1
The tallest hill in Denmark is 500 feet. Actually, the tallest point in Denmark are the two towers of the Bridge to Sweden. So we have no rock whatsoever. But in other places, you actually have an abundance of stone. If you cut the stone electrically, it's carbon-neutral. If you drive it from the quarry to the nearby construction site on an electric truck, it's also carbon-neutral. For instance, in our mines, This brick should be a sustainable material. It's made out of clay. But only if it's sun-dried. The ovens that we use in northern Europe and in most of the industrial world are quite energy-intensive. So once you get into it, the brick that you would suspect to be a very traditional and organic material actually has a substantial carbon footprint, whereas a natural stone, if harvested electrically, is close to carbon Timber, if it's sustainably sourced from a plantation where you replant and you don't chup down more than the replacement rate, can actually count as being carbon negative because it sequesters carbon when it grows. But if you put it in a place where you have to paint it with toxic paints to protect it from the environment, it becomes negative.

[00:37:25.100] - Speaker 1
The interesting thing is that there are no no universal answers. Earth has different climates, different cultures, different economies, different conditions. Each project has a unique potential, a unique set of challenges, and a unique set of opportunities. The exciting part of the work is that it's not about applying this one-size-fits-all. It is in each and every case, to explore We're trying to discover what's exactly the right answer in this case. Maybe just another material that has a very tough reputation these days is concrete. Concrete is a beautiful material. The Romans invented it. The Pantheon, one of the most beautiful spaces in Rome, is a concrete dome. It's essentially when you burn lime, it turns into a cement. In doing so, it releases CO₂. That's why it has a substantial carbon footprint. Then there was a French gardener, I don't know, 150 years ago, who sprayed cement on chicken wire. He realized that with the rebar. The metal inside the concrete, it became reinforced, steel-reinforced concrete, and became much stronger. It could take tension as well as compression. That unleashed the revolution of reinforced concrete, which is Almost every building in the world has a substantial element of this.

[00:39:04.110] - Speaker 1
Concrete is an amazing material. It's a liquid that you pour into a formwork and it solidifies and it holds the form you gave it. We just finished our own headquarters on the tip of the pier in Copenhagen. Because it's surrounded by saltwater on three sides, we looked into timber. But on the outside, we couldn't have it in timber because of the aggressive, corrosive environment of the saltwater. We would have to paint it and maintain it. On the inside, we wanted all of us to be in the same space. With timber, we would have to divide it into fire compartments. And by law, you can only have 25% of the surfaces a lot of timber, and we have a timber shelf on the north side. So that's already 25%. So the more we looked into it, the clearer it became that the timber was making the building much more expensive. It wasn't improving the life cycle The final analysis of the building. We had to then add sprinklers. We couldn't make it passively ventilated. The thermal mass of timber is much lighter than that of concrete. So counter to our assumptions, The more we dug into the specifics, it became clearer and clearer that this really wanted to be a concrete building.

[00:40:23.450] - Speaker 1
And then we started looking. What we could find that we could use immediately was a form of concrete where a A third of the cement has been replaced with clay. That lowers the carbon footprint of the cement with a third. It also makes the concrete a little warmer to look at, which is actually beautiful.

[00:40:41.130] - Speaker 2
We know how long concrete performs for. When you have a new material, how do you know if it's going to perform for 20 years, 30 years?

[00:40:48.610] - Speaker 1
Supposedly this has been fully tested, but of course there is always a question mark. But it seems like it performs exactly the way concrete does. It has been It's substantially tested as it stands. But I also think that each project we do, we try to make it a little bit of an experiment with something. We don't have to experiment on every single parameter in the building, but we always have to make sure that each building somehow takes the journey of architecture one step higher up the ladder. But then there's also things like biochar is a way to, let's say, burn organic waste in the absence of oxygen so that by, in a way, suffocating the fire, it doesn't consume the material, but it turns it into a biochar. It's a very black carbon a sewage material. If you take organic waste, it can even be a sewage sludge, and you turn it into biochar, it won't release that carbon into the atmosphere. The funny thing is, if you take 50 kilos, let's say 100 pounds of biochar for a cubic meter of concrete, it becomes like a dark gray, and it neutralizes. It sequesters as much carbon as the concrete emits.

[00:42:13.960] - Speaker 1
If you make it more like 8% instead of 2%, it becomes a beautiful black concrete. Now it's really, really carbon negative because it sequesters much more. By baking it into the building, it stays there. Finally, there's a new way of using CO₂ by pumping it through saltwater, it creates artificial limestone. It sequesters the CO₂ into limestone, and then you can use that lime to make concrete. So it actually becomes carbon-neutral. So there's very interesting ways. And of course, these have only happened maybe in the last 5 or 10 years, as we have gotten more and more alarmingly aware that we need to address this. So in that sense, again, I think it's counterproductive to stigmatize certain materials as being inherently bad, but we might not be making them in the right way right now, just like the car is not inherently bad. But if all cities only prioritize cars over pedestrians and bicycles, it becomes a nuisance. It should be a multimodal way of getting around the city. Once cars become electric, and once that power then comes from solar or even nuclear or wind, whatever, suddenly the negative side effects of the car can become positive.

[00:43:43.220] - Speaker 1
I think the journey of the evolution of society is that our predecessors were never vicious. When they invented the car, The car was an incredible alternative to the horse. At the turn of the 20th century, cities like New York and London were drowning in horse shit. Horses are relatively unsafe when there's too many of them in an urban environment. They can get scared. Having like piles and piles Of course, horse shit is a health hazard, and it's not good for the environment nor for the health of the people living in that city. In a way, the advent of the automobile saved us from drowning in horse shit. But then, of course, then we started the suffocating from fumes. Each time something offers something amazing, it becomes very popular. This new thing, it has a little bit of a byproduct. That byproduct isn't a problem in smaller quantities. But once everybody has a car, that byproduct actually starts piling up as CO₂ in the atmosphere or as carbon monoxide in the breathable air. But as soon as we discovered the problems of carbon monoxide, we put these catalyst filters on all the cars, and instantly the air got cleaner.

[00:45:07.970] - Speaker 1
Now we've discovered the side effects of CO₂, and solutions are coming forth. In that sense, it's important just to keep understanding that the previous generations weren't bad nor careless. They just knew less than we do today. It's also a bit like the advice for the human diet. When you go In fact, each decade, the things they recommended 10 years ago was the best they could do with the knowledge they had, but it keeps changing. It's not like... I think the only thing we can do is to never stop. Each time we discover new things, to take it to heart and respond swiftly.

[00:45:57.220] - Speaker 3
In a world of artificial highs and harsh stimulants, There is something different, something clean, something precise. Athletic nicotine, not the primitive products found behind convenience store counters, not the aggressive buzz that leaves you jittery.

[00:46:15.280] - Speaker 4
But a careful calibration of clean energy and focused clarity. Athletic nicotine, the lowest dose tobacco-free nicotine available made entirely in the USA.

[00:46:27.330] - Speaker 3
No artificial sweetness, just pure purposeful elevation.

[00:46:31.800] - Speaker 4
Athletic nicotine is a performance neutropic.

[00:46:35.240] - Speaker 3
Athletic nicotine is a tool for shifting mindsets. Athletic nicotine is a partner in pursuit of excellence. Slow release, low dose, gradual lift, sustained energy, soft landing, inspired results.

[00:46:51.550] - Speaker 4
Athletic nicotine, more focus, less static. Athletic nicotine, more clarity, less noise, athletic nicotine, more accuracy, less anxiety, athletic nicotine.

[00:47:08.240] - Speaker 3
From top athletes pushing their limits to artists pursuing their vision, athletic nicotine offers the lift you've been looking for. Learn more at athleticnicotine. Com/tetra and experience next-level performance with athletic nicotine. Warning, this product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.

[00:47:30.260] - Speaker 2
Other than buildings, what have you designed?

[00:47:32.750] - Speaker 1
We designed products. We have a long-standing collaboration with things like ArteMeter, the Italian lighting company. Because the lighting industry has, over the last two decades, had to embrace LEDs and try to find the beauty and esthetics. Because a globe bulb has warm and rich light, but it has a short lifespan and it's very energy-intensive. There's been an incredible space in trying to find ways to make beautiful lighting with the LEDs. Then all the way through the different scales of buildings up to urban master plans. Even we've been working on a plan for the planet, in a way, trying to think what happens if you apply the methodology and the skills of architects and planners and urbanists at the scale of all of the planet. We have a handful of projects where we're making experimental cities. One experimental city that we've had a lot of joy working with is Oceanics. It's the idea of a floating city. The prototype is scheduled to be built in the Port of Busan, floating city block. But it's essentially saying if there are certain countries like the Maldives or French Polynesia that are sinking, and maybe you could start growing those cities.

[00:49:06.570] - Speaker 1
In Miami, you could create floating islands within the Bay. Then maybe the city that is Miami could become more and more parked. The funny thing is a coral reef actually grows with the rising sea levels unless you build a city on top of it because then it dies. You can imagine in the Maldives that you would start building inside the contained body of water so that the Bay Area could become a park protecting the city from the rising sea levels. That's one project where we're looking at floating cities.

[00:49:38.550] - Speaker 2
Would a floating city be similar to what you described in the Google campus with the pylons No, in this case, it would actually be floating on pontoons.

[00:49:49.390] - Speaker 1
You would anchor it or tether it to the ground, and you could adjust those anchors. But it would be literally floating so that with rising levels, it would just simply keep coming up. The pontoon, the space to keep it floating. We actually did a small sample. We created a small neighborhood of 72 student houses in Copenhagen. That is these little hexagonal two-story courtyard houses that are floating on a pontoon. The pontoon contains, of course, enough air to lift it. It has heat pumps extracting excess heat and cool from the water to heat and cool the water and the homes. It has photovoltaics on the roof to power them. It's only connected to the city with the fresh water and wastewater. Apart from that, it's really self-sustaining. Imagine expanding that to a city block. Let's say the city block, everything from the sidewalk and down is food production, energy production, heating and cooling, recycling, upcycling, and power production inside the cavity that is necessary to lift the city. Then the The buildings on top and the landscapes, the gardens need to grow a certain amount of food. They're like multicultural, beautiful gardens that you can walk around in.

[00:51:10.190] - Speaker 1
The buildings are made with timber or bamboo because you want the buildings to be as light as possible. You don't want them much taller than 6 to 8 floors because you don't want to raise the center of gravity to make the city block unstable. In that sense, you end up with some parameters, and then you want to harvest as much energy from the sun as you can because that's one of the sources as you have. We were posing to make the roofs as big as possible to shade the environment, but also to harvest as much sun as possible. You end up with a vernacular style of architecture that is timber and bamboo-based, so it's warm and organic. It has these big roofs to harvest as much sun as possible. Then you end up, interestingly, because in a city, the city grows organically, and at some point, you need to change certain things. Sometimes you you have to expropriate, and you have to tear down some buildings to make space for a wider road or whatever. But in this case, with a floating city, everything can just be moved. You can actually reconfigure the city as it evolves.

[00:52:20.360] - Speaker 1
You can say, We need to make this canal between two city blocks a little wider so we can have some bigger ships coming in. In that sense, it becomes a very exciting proposition of this flexibility. If you take it down to the scale of Copenhagen again, this little neighborhood of floating student homes, it's basically six hexagonal Floating buildings, a total of 72 homes. They right now are docked at a part of the city that used to be industrial port. Now it's waiting for the environmental impact studies and the new urban master plan. There's a period, almost like a pocket in time of one to two decades, where not much is happening while all these things fall into place. That means that It's a perfect place for these students to live. But then in 20 years, new master plan, then we take that little fleet of student homes and we dock it in the next place that's waiting for its future to be decided. Imagine each Each city, as it evolves, always have these not just pockets of space, but pockets in time that are under-enjoyed. Rather than leaving them vacant, you could have a deployable fleet of maybe a couple of hundred student homes that just simply move around.

[00:53:50.620] - Speaker 1
It is like to have a little fleet of houseboats. It's good for a city because it allows you to create a community community instead of an abandoned wasteland. You can have a little community that breathes life into this place until the more permanent city can arrive.

[00:54:11.190] - Speaker 2
It sounds really easy to add on to if you wanted to add another Yeah, you can just expand the fleet a little bit.

[00:54:17.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah, no, exactly. That's a tricky one. But that's one experimental city we've been working on. Another one, we're creating a city called the Woven City, currently on a construction at the base of Mount in Japan. That's an experimental city looking at a city where you have driverless cars. We were hired by Toyota, President Akio Toyoda of the Toyota Company. He had this interesting realization that Toyota actually used to be a loom manufacturer. In the late 19th century, they were making looms for the textile industry. Then in the 1930s, when the automobile had been invented because they were so good at making large, complex machines, they became the largest carmaker in the world. A few years ago, Accio Toyota was realizing that it was time to pivot again. They could no longer just be a carmaker. They had to be a provider of urban mobility as a service with whatever means that is. He said, Therefore, I need to be able to experiment at the at a city scale, not just making nice products in the form of cars, but thinking about the systems of a city. They were closing down two factories because they were moving elsewhere.

[00:55:42.020] - Speaker 1
He gave us that territory to try to We came up with a city, and we came up with what we've called the Woven City. The basic analysis is that today we try to do everything on every street, and that just makes everything dominated by cars. We said, A lot of you have three kinds of streets? One with autonomous electric vehicles and pedestrians like a traditional street, but they're driverless. One which is more like a promenade, half green, half paved for Personal mobility like bikes and scooters and pedestrians. Then one that is entirely a park where you can only walk. So all green with paths. You take one, two, three, one, two, three in both directions, weave together, which means that for every nine blocks, you have a perimeter of access by car, and then you have access by promenade, by bike, or walking only through a park. You end up with a city in the center of these nine squares. We always make it either a little public park or a kindergarten or a small school. You end up with a city fabric where you can get from anywhere to anywhere riding a driverless car, taking an electric scooter or walking through a park.

[00:57:06.400] - Speaker 1
You have the same amount of connectivity, but you take two-thirds of the right of way that is normally just completely dominated by cars, and you give it up for more exciting forms of life. Then we work with using hydrogen as a power source for fuel cells. It's geothermally powered because it's right next to a volcanic activity, Mount Fuji. We're trying to take every single sustainable urban experiment and condense it into this new neighborhood. Toyota is now realizing that vision, inviting all of their collaborators to come join them in testing the principles and the technologies that might inform all our other cities in the near future. That's another interesting experiment. Maybe a last experiment is we're doing a CD for the Kingdom of Bhutan called the mindfulness city. Bhutan is a small country, less than a million inhabitants. It's the most sustainable country in the world. It sequesters twice as much carbon as it emits. But they're experiencing that the young generations are drawn to the 21st century in Canada and Australia, primarily, but also Singapore and Mumbai. They realized that even though they are succeeding on so many parameters, and I think we, the West, have a lot to learn from Bhutan.

[00:58:35.000] - Speaker 1
They also somehow need to create a prosperous, energetic, dynamic, creative urban environment to be able to attract foreign investment and to be able to retain their talent, their future. They want to create a special administrative zone on the border to India, but they don't want to become duplic Dubai or Mumbai. They invited us to say, How can we create a dynamic, inviting, engaging, contemporary urban environment that is rooted in the values of Vajana Buddhism and that is anchored in the strengths and the traditions we have living and breathing in Bhutan? Another very valuable challenge and a simple answer to the question is we thought, Bhutan is covered by 72% forests. To the north, it's the highest peaks of the Himalayas, and to the south, it's basically the tropical fields of India. This particular city is traversed by 34 rivers. We decided to make the rivers the urban master plan. Each river becomes a linear central park. Between them, we create terraces almost like rice that cascade down the slopes at the base of the Himalayas. Every time you cross the river, that becomes a public institution. The bridges become destinations also. The universities are bridges.

[01:00:15.090] - Speaker 1
The public buildings, the airport is a bridge. Because Butan is incredible in the sense that all the crafts are still alive. They have many schools that still educate the wood carvers, the the painters. We are creating this contemporary vernacular architecture that can take advantage of modern manufacturing, but also take advantage of the presence of craft to make buildings that build with bamboo and river rocks. In some way, trying to bring the best of both worlds and maybe show a way forward where you don't have to erase the nature, but you can enhance the nature with the city. You don't have to erase the culture by putting a modern city. You can actually imagine a modern city that is impregnated, informed by the culture. Sounds great. It's incredibly fun. One example is the whole city is powered by hydropower. The dam is 500-foot-tall dam. But instead of a sheet of concrete, we've made it modular with the steps like a Bhutanese equivalent of an Indian stepwell so that the entire front is a colorful, we call it the temple dam, a colorful wall of a thousand steps that takes you to a temple that is nested on the side of the dam, like the Tiger's Nest, one of the most famous temples in Bhutan that is nested on the side of a mountain, so that you have this prilcomage.

[01:01:55.350] - Speaker 1
Like anyone who's been to the Hoover Dam has been standing at the top and thought about, couldn't it be it cool if we could get like, climb down the face. In this case, you can. You can walk down the face of the dam along these colorful steps to a temple that somehow turns the infrastructure for power into an infrastructure for spirituality. Of course, it turns engineering into art, and it turns nature into power. I think with each project, we're trying to distill the values of the mindfulness city into build form. Let's say if the Eiffel Tower was a demonstration of French engineering. Engineering is actually a profession invented by the French at a time when the world was being connected with railroads, and Eiffel, the designer of the Eiffel Tower, was a railroad engineer making bridges, and he used the technology of railroads and bridges to make this symbol of French ingenuity and engineering. I think, similarly, the Temple Dam could be a way to show that the future and the past, the global and the hyper local, The spiritual and the ecological and the economical and the economical can actually perfectly coexist if we try to find these.

[01:03:22.500] - Speaker 2
What's so interesting about it is all of the elements were already there. The idea of a dam is not a new idea. The idea of the temple on the side of a mountain is not a new idea. It's just the juxtaposition of them is radical.

[01:03:37.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. I think it may be almost like part of our secret sauce is this idea of the oxymoron, that things that seem to be contradicting are maybe not. Things that seem to be mutually exclusive Maybe they're not. I think it almost extends into culture and politics is that the world has experienced this extreme polarization. It would be strange if half of the population are wrong and the other half are right, or half the population is dumb and the other half of the population is smart. I don't think that's how it is, because when you look at any normal distribution of any population, it typically draws a bell curve where you have most in the middle and few and few are in the extremes. To get away from this polarized worldview of one or the other and really to, as almost a value-driven ideological agenda, to commit yourself, to try to see if there's There's ways to find new and interesting ways forward that incorporate some of the wisdom or concerns of two things that seem to be opposite.

[01:05:12.380] - Speaker 2
Well, it would start with the sides understanding each other, which seems to be a difficult bridge to gap.

[01:05:18.440] - Speaker 1
I would say cancel culture in whatever form, has eliminated the possibility of conversation. I think once you stop listening to someone who has from a different point of view, that's when you stop growing and you stop learning.

[01:05:34.100] - Speaker 2
Why do you think Danish furniture is so celebrated all over the world? How did it come to be that way?

[01:05:42.020] - Speaker 1
I'm not an expert in Danish furniture, by the way, but I think what happened was with Danish modern furniture, it was a time where industrialization had happened. That meant that there was like with the Bauhaus movement. Let's say the Bauhaus was trying to use the methods of modern manufacturing and the new materials to address living, housing at scale for the masses. They tried to find new esthetics, but using steel and modern materials. In Denmark, we don't have any mountains. We also don't have any resources. I think that the Danish designers, they similarly tried to make mass-produced furniture to the masses, but using wood and a hemp and maybe a little bit of cowhide. But in this Danish, Protestant mindset of simplicity. The Danish esthetics are similar to those of Japanese traditional architecture or the Quakers. A austerity that boils things down to the essentials. That means you can still put effort into making sure that the armrest is really soft to the touch, and it really is exactly what you need to rest your your elbows One of my favorite pieces of furniture is the PK-22, Paul Kjeldheim's thesis project from the Furniture Academy. In this case, it's a single piece of steel that has been cut with a water beam, and pulled apart.

[01:07:31.480] - Speaker 1
As you pull that single piece of steel apart, it becomes the form of the chair. Then you just have a little bit of flag line, flag rope to create a seat. It's very elegant. It's like just a single material, or let's say two materials, manipulate it with a single process, and it's incredibly comfortable and incredibly elegant. I think in that sense, this rejection of tournament and decoration combined in favor of a thoughtful, careful effort into exactly what's necessary. Then secondly, this embrace of some of the more traditional materials, the organic materials, It's like timber, cowhide, rope. It gives it a timeless quality. By embracing the traditional materials, it has an organic quality. By rejecting the core, you boil it down to something that is still beautiful and elegant, but it's more essential anyway.

[01:08:37.680] - Speaker 2
When you take the specimen away, it fits everywhere because it's not so style-specific that it only fits in the one place where that style is.

[01:08:49.830] - Speaker 1
You say the decor would often come with a certain style, exactly. Then it can only fit with other things that have that decor.

[01:08:58.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah. If you It's like if you take a baroque piece. You can't put it anywhere.

[01:09:03.410] - Speaker 1
I would say maybe it boils us down to a sensibility that we definitely also have is that I think when you look at our buildings, they will have personality and character, even a strong expression. But again, it's like this idea, the energy is injected into the performance of the building, not in the decoration of the So much of today's life happens on the web.

[01:10:59.880] - Speaker 2
You talked about having to break ground. Is there a tendency, I can imagine this, where you have a project and you see, well, in 10 years, the materials are going to be better to build this project than the materials available now. Do we wait 10 years?

[01:11:17.970] - Speaker 1
Exactly. For instance, with concrete, I know that within the next five years, there will be a carbon-neutral concrete. They're also working carbon-neutral steel. Therefore, the easy hack right now is if you can, if you make the building out of timber, it lowers the embodied carbon, and it puts pressure on the steel and concrete industry because they see it happening. If I was a steel manufacturer and I saw Zurich Airport, I would see, Okay, they're beginning to make big airports out of timber now. That used to be our domain, like large spans. We should probably move the needle on this, right?

[01:12:08.160] - Speaker 2
Is carbon the only metric, or are there other things that are maybe just as important that don't get as much conversation.

[01:12:17.200] - Speaker 1
I think we have to remember there is actually a strange stigmatization of the built environment, right? There's a strange stigmatization of energy use. 200 years ago, we would only burn wood as our source of That's not very sustainable. Then we discovered coal, oil, and gas. You just see a dramatic increase in access to energy. You see perfectly parallel to this increase in access to energy, you see an increase in quality of life on every single continent. If you measure it as something simple as life expectancy, every single continent on Earth, as soon as we started to have access to more energy, we started living better and longer. So energy is good. We should also remember, the only things in the world that don't spend energy are dead things. All living things harvest energy from the environment, and they use that energy to resist entropy. It's the definition of life. We need energy to live, and we convert that energy into life. And buildings, of course, they say that buildings are responsible for 40% of of our carbon footprint. But it's also because we live, we die, we work, we go to the hospital, we go shopping, we go listen to music.

[01:13:44.070] - Speaker 1
In buildings, No wonder that we're spending a lot of our energy on building and operating our buildings.

[01:13:52.590] - Speaker 2
That's where we live.

[01:13:53.500] - Speaker 1
That's where we live. Try spending a winter in Denmark without a house It's going to be a tough winter. We can't really live outside East Africa without buildings. We build buildings to accommodate life. But of course, we have to do it in the most thoughtful way because we don't want to do it at the expense of the climate. I would say there are so many metrics. Over the last couple of decades, we've become more and more aware of the gasification that comes from various materials. In the past, we built with materials that were unhealthy. That's measurable, and there's a lot of effort in-Asbestos, for example. Asbestos, exactly. The fibers from the asbestos panels would nest inside your lung tissue and give you asbestosis. There's all kinds of examples of efforts where we are constantly trying to make our environments more healthy, higher performing, more enjoyable. I just think right now there's a lot of focus on carbon because at a global scale, that is the one challenge that affects us all. Also because climate change and temperature change doesn't really care who emitted the carbon, everybody gets to suffer it. I think in that sense, there is a huge effort to be placed there, but we just have to remember to stigmatize construction One would be stupid, but of course, to be smarter and smarter about avoiding wastefulness.

[01:15:37.200] - Speaker 1
You can say we've worked with Rene Rzezepi, one of the greatest chefs in the world, the chef of NOMA, we designed his restaurant. One of the things they do is that for the meals, when they serve meat or seafood, they cook the whole animal, not just the tenderloin. The cheeks, the nose, the brain, whatever, every single part of the animal ends up on your plate, and you realize that's also amazing. I think similarly, I've been traveling around the quarries of travertine in Tivoli and the Carrara Marble, the quarries. Of course, you have the incredible stone, but you also realize that all of Earth is essentially rock, so there's a bit of it. But when When you extract it, maybe in the past, they only took the nicest piece of statue of marble, and the rest was just left by the side of the road. But increasingly, everything, even when there's only rubble left, that rubble is grinded down to a beautiful dust that you can use in a mamolina building materials, but you can also use it for toothpaste. Calcium carbonate as a supplement for For cereals. In a refined ecosystem in nature, there is no waste.

[01:17:06.180] - Speaker 2
Everything gets used.

[01:17:07.300] - Speaker 1
The perfect example is that the poop of one life form becomes the nutrient of another life form. You can say each time you have a byproduct, it is potentially the product for something else. Understood. Each time you have a dead end, that dead end will pile up until it becomes a problem. But it's also a renewable resource of something. You just have to find out what that something is.

[01:17:34.440] - Speaker 2
I remember seeing a presentation you gave for a community. It was single family dwellings on a space of land. And part of the sustainability of each of these houses was every house had a cow.

[01:17:48.970] - Speaker 1
Exactly. What we tried to do is to say we take all of Earth. And by 2050, we will be 10 billion people. And we said we should all have the same quality of life as Denmark. It's a relatively high use of energy and a good quality of life. We said, Okay, 10 billion people. Then we took all of Earth and we said, If we have all of Earth to sustain 10 billion people, what do we have per Earthling? The answer is you have 750 by 750 feet of area. Two-thirds of that, a bit more, is ocean. Almost a 10th of that is uninhabited habitable, glaciers and mountains, etc. Then roughly one hectare, two acres, is habitable.

[01:18:37.370] - Speaker 2
Most people don't get to live on two acres. This is already a bonus.

[01:18:40.420] - Speaker 1
No, it's already to step up. Exactly. Then half is nature, untouched nature. The other half is, like roughly one acre per person, is mostly agriculture with a tiny bit of city. Then we started looking at, and this is just taking all of the agriculture of all of Earth and dividing it by 10 billion. That should be enough to sustain this one-earthing. We started saying, so what happens? We started by looking at the agriculture. You have emissions of methane from rice fields. When we burn crop residue, we emit CO₂. When we fertilize, we emit nitrous oxide, which is also a greenhouse gas. We started looking at all those things and we tried to see if we could do it differently. Also, we found out a relatively large portion of agriculture that's mostly palm and corn, is energy crops. Things we grow in order to burn them to produce energy, you can just replace that with photovoltaics much more efficiently. Then we reach the cow. Of course, there's a lot of discussion about a vegan diet being the only sustainable thing because cows, they burp the equivalent of 102 tons of CO₂ per year in the form of methane.

[01:20:00.660] - Speaker 1
To sequester that CO₂ equivalent, you need roughly one grown tree per ton per year. A cow and a calf needs 2 hectares of grassland to sustain them. You can comfortably fit 108 trees on this land, which gives you what's called silvopasture, the combination of animal husbandry and forestry. That's the natural habitat for large herbivores. If you convert consistently to a silver pasture, you get happier cows, you increase biodiversity because the trees form habitat for all kinds of other animals, and you increase the productivity because the cows are happier, and the trees sequester the carbon to offset the methane of the burbs of the cows. In that sense, using only what we already have, we can actually make beef healthier and more sustainable.

[01:21:08.770] - Speaker 2
Also, what you're describing is before man intervened, probably about how it worked on the planes.

[01:21:18.520] - Speaker 1
Also, if you go to Martha, Texas, you see the cattle walking around in the fields. If you go to Argentina, you see the cattle roaming around in the Pampas. There There are many places where this happens. There's just also many places where it doesn't. What we were essentially trying to do was just to see... Because one thing that I was tired of, and the reason we started doing the plan for planet, is that COVID had happened. We went remote, except our model workshop. All the architects were sitting at home, but a few volunteers volunteered to come into the model workshop because using our 3D printers and the plexi sheets that we used for our architectural models, we could make face shields and ventilator tubes. Someone had open-sourced some files that we could use, and we kept refining them to make it more and more effective and fast. We ended up manufacturing 25,000 of these items in the first six weeks until the supply chain could catch up. It felt good that we just so happened to have the skills, in this case, the machines and the materials, to address one of the greatest challenges on Earth at the time, access to emergency medical equipment.

[01:22:29.750] - Speaker 1
We We thought, Is there another thing we can do? We thought, Why don't we look at the planet? Because I was so tired that you always whenever you discuss about the environment and sustainability, what aboutism can derail any conversation Because someone will say, Yeah, but what about... And what you always hear is this idea that you need six or seven or eight or 20 Earths to sustain humanity if we all had the same quality of life as, let's say, Denmark. I was just curious, is this really true?It's.

[01:23:02.450] - Speaker 2
Not true.It's not true.

[01:23:04.050] - Speaker 1
But if it was true, then we should really face that, and then we should really consider. The second thing you always hear is that we have to wait for new technologies to get invented because we can't power humanity sustainably without fusion energy or other cool things that aren't just available yet. So should we just sit and wait? And again, we found that some of the highest yielding forms of renewable energy is the sun and wind, if combined with energy storage in the form of hydrogen or batteries. So just in a way, from a very first principles point of view, we started looking at the big numbers, and then we started realizing that it remains quite abstract. But if we would boil it down to a single earthling, everything becomes super tangible. Let's say the beautiful thing that we discovered is that using only existing available techniques, using only the area we have, we can actually reduce the footprint necessary to sustain an earthling.Quality.

[01:24:10.690] - Speaker 2
Of life could go up.Quality.

[01:24:12.360] - Speaker 1
Of life could go up. We started seeing What would it take to sustain all the Danes? There's five and a half million of us. What about all the Americans? We compared that to the territory of the United States of America. I think there is a reason why in architecture and planning, we have a methodology of a mixture of plans that indicate the different processes, a mixture of illustrations that show how desirable or not this future development is. Then there's some text that is the description of the project. There's, importantly, an area table that shows this and this much. If it's an urban mastermind, so and so much housing, so and so much. An area table. There's also a budget that shows this is what it costs to build all of these things. Also, there's a return on investment or not. But if there isn't a return on investment, then the project probably won't happen. Then finally, there is a phasing There's how to do it. There's an implementation plan that if we want to be here by 2050, and some of the master plans we are looking at, the urban master plans, they have time horizons that go to 2050.

[01:25:28.710] - Speaker 1
We're already working I'm not on them now, but somehow because Earth has never had a planning jurisdiction or at the scale of Earth-It's a hypothetical.

[01:25:41.210] - Speaker 2
The good news is, what you found was With just using what we know now, the quality of life for everyone on Earth can go up. It could be sustainable, not even taking into account fusion, fission, whatever might come.

[01:25:57.760] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Of course, by having Is there a plan that already works now that you can start implementing, as soon as you can plug fusion into the grid, of course. But you should just get going right away because it's very clear if we want to get there by 2050, you have to start now. Certain countries, and there's a lot to be said about China, and it's not only good, but my God, have they been good? They've completely overshot. They've already reached now the goals they had for solar energy capacity in 2030. To get there, we need to have a plan. We need to know that this is what we want, and we need to start working on it.

[01:28:00.160] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Yeses More.

[01:28:02.650] - Speaker 1
I mean, very specifically, it's our first book that we published in 2009. It came out right after the subprime economic collapse of September 2008. It was an exhibition we were opening in January 2009. The world was so pessimistic, and I wanted to create a a positive injection. Secondly, Yeses More is, of course, like a mutation of less is more, which is a statement often attributed to Mies van der Rohe, the German grandfather of modernism. When I started studying architecture, I said, I'm starting to become an architect, then people say, Oh, an actor. I said, I know an architect. And then some, okay. Then the second question would typically be, okay, so maybe you can tell me why are all modern buildings so boring? I think this The idea of less is more. Of course, it means to do more with less, to make things simpler, more elegant. And Mies Van Oord was an incredible architect. But you could also say that a lot of his buildings, he ended up doing a lot of very similar towers all over North America. What started as this freedom from augmentation, I talked a little bit about the Barcelona Pavilion.

[01:29:21.540] - Speaker 1
The Farnsworth house is another incredible house. Very simple, very elegant. Transparency inside-outside, continuity, a dissolution of the traditional confines of a walled space into something more open and abstract. But then he ended up doing the Seagram Tower on Park Avenue and the Lakeshore Drive towers in Chicago. Eventually, he ended up doing a lot of towers that looked very similar, beautifully detailed boxes that are essentially the same. So somehow, less is more has become people's negative expectation of the architect as being some a design Nazi that discriminates, and it's very exclusive, and it's all about no. Then came Robert Venturi, who said, less is a bore. He was saying, Why does modern building have to be so boring? Why don't we rediscover some of the cool things from the traditional city, the pitched roofs, the monuments, and brought back in the form of postmodernism. But it was, of course, just a style or decor. Then Philip Johnson, an American architect, said, I'm a whore. He said, I'm a whore, but I'm a well-paid one that makes skyscrapers for companies for hire. He was somehow emphasizing this idea that, of course, that you're always working for someone.

[01:30:44.530] - Speaker 1
But Secondly, he was very eclectic, and he made eclecticism into almost like a driving force. You could say he was maybe always a little bit too inspired by someone else. Was the work really original? Did he really have a core as an artist? But at least he had the freedom to pursue almost any language, any vocabulary, without worrying if it fit with his identity. Then because Obama had just been elected, we included in this sequence evolution of ideas, Yes, we can. Because when Obama came with Yes, we can, it was somehow this, Yes, we can change, this energy that a whole nation can come together around a unifying agenda. Then we listed in this completely pretentious, we inserted ourselves as the culmination of this string of thoughts with Yes, it's more as a manifesto for inclusion that you typically associate the avant-garde with being against something. The revolutionary is always dependent on someone that they are rebelling against. If your agenda is negatively by who or what you are against, then you are fundamentally a follower in reverse. Therefore, rather than being against something, what if there was a way forward where you, instead of saying no to everything and by being radical, by saying no, what if you said yes to even conflicting and contradicting demands?

[01:32:28.280] - Speaker 1
Denmark is the culture culture of consensus, it is the least unequal country in the world. Disagreement is almost embarrassing. No concern is too little to be overheard. How can you do anything interesting in such an environment? We thought, What if we turn inclusion and saying yes into a radical agenda? I think the best way to describe it architecturally is like a game of Twister. If you know the game of Twister, you have a on the floor. When you begin the game, you have to put your foot here and your other foot there, and you're just standing in a standard normal position. But then as the game escalates, you get more and more demands, and you suddenly find yourself in backbending configurations with your face rubbing up against body parts or family members, and the game becomes more and more fun. In a way, by making the game more difficult, you force the standard posture into some acrobatic form. Similarly, and it's important to understand in architecture, the standard solution, nothing becomes the standard by being bad. The standard solution is actually very good at delivering a certain thing. The typical example is this modernist housing project, and then you end up this cookie cutter, rubber stamp.

[01:33:53.770] - Speaker 1
There's so many other things that you're building when you're building a neighborhood, not just apartments. In that sense, by saying yes to all the other demands and requirements, even though you make the problem more difficult to solve, you also ensure that the standard solution, which is the hardest thing to escape because it's so good at doing this one thing, the standard solution no longer works because that only satisfies some of the requirements, but all the other requirements that you have now piled on and committed to are not being served. So you escape the tyranny of the standard solution, and you find yourself in a new territory where you have to discover new solutions to problems that are-But all based on new needs, additional needs. New needs, new requirements, new challenges. In that sense, we turned this idea of yes and inclusion not into compromise. Just the opposite. Or the yes man. But actually using it as a radical agenda to free ourselves from the standard solutions and find new and more exciting possibilities. You can say, yes is more is a manifesto for inclusionism as a radical agenda in architecture.

[01:35:21.040] - Speaker 2
That's great.

[01:35:21.990] - Speaker 1
If we say the revolutionary is defined by who or what, he or she is against, the opposite would the evolutionary, where instead of throwing out the past, instead of decapitating-It's like building on the past. It's evolving, stepping from the past and discovering something new.

[01:35:43.370] - Speaker 2
It's not rejecting anything.

[01:35:46.120] - Speaker 1
Exactly. It's just building upon it and trying to do more, trying to actually continue the journey. That's also why I keep saying it's so important that sometimes you need to be critical of where you're coming from, but it's not because anyone was mean or careless. We just came further, and we now have the benefit of the perspective we have from one step higher, looking back, like Kyrie I'd said, Life is lived going forward, but it's understood looking backwards. We have that benefit. In that sense, evolution is a much more productive attitude where you can inherit everything that works and just continue where your ancestors left off.
