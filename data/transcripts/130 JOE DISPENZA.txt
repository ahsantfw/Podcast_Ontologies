[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 1
Well, I think that we've discovered some really cool things about the process of creation. I think that human beings live in one of two states. They either live in a state of survival, and living in survival is living in stress. When you're in stress and in survival, it's not a time to create. Or the creative state is when you fall in love with whatever it is that you're creating. We found that the heart tends to be the creative center, that when you can relax into your heart fully. That's a practice that if you can get into that state, there's a physiological change that takes place in the brain. In other words, the heart informs the brain, number one, to get creative. That's what it tells it. When we get creative, we tend to move into more elegant, lighter brainwave state called alpha. In alpha, we tend to see in images, we tend to see in pictures. The brain is in an imaginary state. When When that occurs, you can see on our scans that there's this wave of energy from the heart to tell the brain to get creative. Like grabbing a big sheet and giving a little whip, it creates this rush of energy to the brain to tell the brain to move into an alpha state, very coherent alpha state.

[00:01:20.260] - Speaker 1
When that occurs, we tend to think about possibilities that we don't typically think about before. The more we practice that, the more we relax into our heart like a springboard, the more energy moves into the brain. That's the first thing. The second thing that we've discovered is that the creative act actually takes place primarily in the present moment. When you get so involved with what you're creating that you forget about yourself, you forget about all the people in your life, all the things you have to do, all the meetings, all the obligations, what happened yesterday, what you're going to do in a few hours. The labor for the present moment is really being in the unknown. That's where the creative process takes place. If you're living in an emotional state and that emotion is causing you to think about some memory, because emotions are a record of the past, we would call that the familiar past, and that's the known. If your body is habituated in doing the same thing every day, you could say that the body is on a program and it's in the predictable future. Predictable future, anything you predict is the known.

[00:02:26.640] - Speaker 1
When you move into that present moment, you're moving into the unknown. That's where you can't create anything from the known. You can only create it from the unknown. We're unraveling this process a little bit.

[00:02:37.760] - Speaker 2
It's beautiful. It sounds like when you're in this present moment, there's a sense of well-being associated with that.

[00:02:44.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah. If you can sustain it, this is what we discovered, you can sustain that state where you're relaxed in the heart and awake in the brain. That state causes waves in the brain. If you can sustain alpha coherent state, alpha starts to build more energy. It's the waves begin to interfere and they start to create bigger waves. You see the body move into this beautiful, elegant, resonant state where there's waves in the brain that are interacting with other waves, and the waves interacting with other waves is creating more energy. That tends to feel so good that you don't want the moment to end. You want to elongate the moment. If you look at brain waves, it's funny because we're right now in the beta brainwave state. We're just local in space and time. We're conscious of ourselves, we're conscious of our surroundings. That's the brain's ability to be able to integrate as much information as it can through its senses and make meaning out of it, to create coherence between the outer world and the inner world. When the brain goes into a stressful or survival state, it moves into this very high aroused beta brainwave state.

[00:03:54.560] - Speaker 1
That's when you're very focused, very focused on your body, your environment, and time. You become very narrow focused. You become obsessive on something. When you're in stress, you're overthinking it, you're analyzing it in the brain actually goes into a higher and higher beta brainwave state. We actually move our brain and body out of balance by thought alone. By broadening our awareness and sensing nothing, broadening our attention to not-It's this past thought. Exactly. Past thought. Past thought. If you're thinking, you're analyzing. What separates the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is the analytical mind. 5% is our conscious mind, 95% was programmed. As you sense space, the act of sensing nothing does two things. It causes you to stop thinking and analyzing if you're sensing space. If you're not thinking about the people in your life or the objects that you own or the place you need to be, or the place where you're sitting or the place where you live, those neurological networks in the brain no longer fire because you're no longer activating them. The brain waves tend to slow down into that alpha state. The beauty behind it is that if you can really, really get into it, your brain moves into that very low theta brainwave state.

[00:05:04.220] - Speaker 1
In theta now, it tends to be like time is much more elongated. In beta, in high beta, there's never enough time. In alpha, you feel you got a little bit more time to create. In theta, there's so much room that's very elongated present moment. So time becomes dilated. Time slows down. Yeah, dilates, right? You lose track of space and you lose track of time, right? If you can sustain that period, Where your body is in that theta state and it's carrying alpha and it's carrying beta, and beta is carrying high beta, and high beta is carrying gamma, and gamma is super consciousness. All of a sudden now you're in an altered state of space and time. You have no reference to space and time. You're in a realm beyond space and time. That's where you take all of your attention off the material and you put it on the in material. There tends to be more information in the in material than we'll ever get from the material.

[00:05:57.480] - Speaker 2
Amazing. What are all What are some of the ways that we can get into that state?

[00:06:03.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah, so I mentioned two right off the bat. As I said, when you're in a state of stress or a state of survival, if you're being chased by T-rex, most of your attention is on your body, Most of your attention is on your environment because you're looking where to run, and of course, you're thinking about time. The brain gets fixed in a super aroused state, and we become very overfocused. As I said, we narrow our focus, very object-focused. The act of broadening our attention to nothing, to opening our awareness to space, causes the brain not only to slow down in its brain waves, but when we're in high beta, our brain is shifting our attention from one person to another person to another object, to another thing, because we're trying to control and predict everything in our life. As a consequence of that, the brain tends to become very modulated. It tends to become more compartmentalized. It becomes a house divided against itself. The brain starts firing very incoherently. The brain starts firing out of order because those different compartments, like a lightning storm in the clouds, are firing in different ways. The waves are interfering with each other and the brain waves are diminishing energy in the brain.

[00:07:13.860] - Speaker 1
When the brain is incoherent, we're incoherent. As we broaden our awareness, the sense space, not only do we slow our brain waves down, but those different compartments, and this is what our fMRI studies show, the different compartments that have been modulated, that have been compartmentalized, which by the way, is a function of age as well, there tends to be more connectivity in the brain. The different neurons that are connecting in different communities, in different compartments, start reaching out and connecting with other neurons in the brain. So you have this synchronization that's taking place in the brain, and what sinks in the brain links in the brain. So when our brain is highly coherent, we can hold a very clear intention, and that's a very important part of the creative act. We have to have a vision of the future, and that has to be very clear. Broadening our awareness creates that synchronization that causes the brain to move into that more intentional state. The other element that it takes is to begin to practice opening your heart, because if you're truly in the creative process and you're getting into it, in the beginning, there's dissonance.

[00:08:21.500] - Speaker 1
I don't like this. You got to go through all of that. And all of a sudden, there comes a moment where there's a spark in the brain and you start falling in love with whatever you're creating. And love is what bonds us. It's the glue. It's what holds it all together. So practicing then feeling elevated emotions. Instead of feeling resentment or impatience or judgment or frustration, those cause an effect in the heart also that becomes very incoherent. When we feel elevated emotions, there tends to be more order, more energy in the heart. And so if you can combine that with a The slower breathing process, to slow your breathing down, helps to convert the body from that fight or flight sympathetic state to a more relaxed state called the parasympathetic state, where there's more energy for What we're doing internally. When we're in stress, more of energy is on the external. We practice, first and foremost, out of all the things that you can put your attention on, all the people, all the obligations, all the meetings, all the places, your cell phone, whatever. On all the things you can put your attention on, you put it on your heart.

[00:09:33.820] - Speaker 1
We've discovered that where you place your attention is where you place your energy. There's a very low frequency that the heart uses to beat. It's indigenous. It's the very energy for the heart to thrive. We see that very low frequency in the heart when a person puts their attention on it. Like the way there are scans or design, it looks like the gas tank is filling up. So the heart is getting energy. All right, so put your attention on it. Slow Slow your breathing down because when we're tense and we're up tight, we tend to shorten our breath. Our breath gets way too exacerbated. So find that regulation where you can slow your breathing down. And when you slow your breathing down, you also slow your brain waves down. Work with your body like you're training an animal and get it out of that state of vigilance, that state of readiness to get it to slow down a little bit.

[00:10:23.860] - Speaker 2
Do we naturally know how to focus on the heart?

[00:10:27.680] - Speaker 1
I think we tend to relax into our heart. I think it's a natural process. I think, though, that so many people are conditioned to live in survival and be addicted to those hormones of stress that they forgot how to feel with their heart. We tend to feel with every other part of our body but our hearts. In our community, it's a very fundamental point of consciousness that connects the community because the heart is a different consciousness than the consciousness of fear, the consciousness of anger, the consciousness of judgment of suffering. It's a different consciousness, a different energy there. And prosocial networks tend to become more activated, and we tend to commune, we tend to connect, we tend to bond. So I think when all of those factors or ingredients are in place, human beings tend to want to rest in their heart. The heart also, when it beats in a certain level of coherence, begins to produce a profound magnetic feel, the feel that's being emanated from the body. And we tend to feel more connected to everything, and we tend to see more beauty in things. The majority of people spend the majority of their time living in that state of survival, right?

[00:11:35.840] - Speaker 1
So we have to stop feeling one way, and we got to start practicing and feeling another way. There's an essential element where you have to work with the body to train it again, to breathe. It doesn't want to breathe slowly. It wants to breathe the way it's been breathing. You have to break that resistance. If you put your attention on it, you may not feel a lot of love the first time, but we now know that you're giving the hard energy. All of a sudden, you see the scan, you see the parasympathetic nervous system start to move up, which means the body is relaxing. Then what we discovered was something we didn't expect. All of a sudden, you see the parasympathetic nervous system start to go down, and there's this elevation in the sympathetic response. But the sympathetic nervous system is usually an aroused state that creates fear, that creates pain, that creates anger or aggression. But this arousal tends to feel really good. It tends to be ecstasy. It tends to be bliss.

[00:12:30.860] - Speaker 2
It tends to be-That's unusual, too. Typically, there's the parasympathetic and sympathetic, and they're like a seesaw. Exactly. One goes up, the other goes down. Also in your film, we got to see in deep meditation, they both go up. Yeah. That's very unusual.

[00:12:46.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's a great point. That's exactly what we discovered. We were working with a bunch of researchers, three researchers at Harvard University, and they discovered that there's also a sympathetic The sympathetic response is taking place, but the sympathetic response is not in survival. It's elevating. It's ecstasy, it's bliss, it's connections. It's ineffitable. There's almost not a language to describe whatever that is, what we're feeling. But The best part about it is that we're not feeling it from anything outside of us. It's coming from within us. That's when people stop looking for it, I think, out there, and they start looking for it in there. I do think, to answer your question, that it's innate in us to love. It's innate in us to be kind. It's innate in us to care. It's innate in us to be creative, to be inspired, to feel grateful, to feel appreciative, to feel and see beauty in things. I think it's innate in us, but it's not active in us if the majority of our time we're living in that state of stress and survival.

[00:13:49.680] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the outer world and our inner world. How do they harmonize or bump up against each other?

[00:13:55.430] - Speaker 1
I think about this all the time. I'll give a very A simple example. If we're not being defined every day by a vision of the future for ourselves, creating something that we would like to experience, I assert that we're left with the memories of the past. And so your brain is a reflection of everything that you know in your external environment. It's an artifact of everything you've experienced up into this moment. It's a repository of everything you've learned and experienced as an autobiographical self. You have a neurological network for your partner. You have a neurological network for your pets. You have a neurological network for your kids. You have a neurological network for your phone, for your car, for your house, for Every place, every object, everything is mapped in your brain. Because we've experienced them, there's a neurological network that's associated with them. We also have an emotion associated with everything in our external environment. You have an emotion associated with your enemy, with your coworker, with your phone, whatever it is. There's an emotion that keeps us giving that very thing our attention. If you're not being defined by a vision of the future, and the brain is pretty much a record of the past, as you see the same people, and you go to the same places, and you do the exact same things at the exact same time, as you see those different people that are known to you, they're causing those circuits in your brain to become activated, to think about that person or that circumstance in terms of the memory of the experience you've had with them.

[00:15:38.600] - Speaker 2
You're living in the past.

[00:15:39.960] - Speaker 1
You're living in the past. All the time. Then the emotion that you give them, that you associate with them because you've experienced them, is causing your body to be in the past. So now, the moment you feel anger, the moment you feel hatred, the moment you feel resentment, whatever it is, or the moment you feel love, for For the most part, that outer environment is causing you as an individual to feel and think equal to everything known in your environment. So the way you think and the way you feel creates your life. So if you're thinking in the same ways, equal to everything that's known in your life, theoretically, then everything should stay the same in your life because you're the same in your life and nothing changes in our life until we change. In the worst case scenario, when you find a person who's living equal to their environment and you say to them, Why are you so upset today? Why are you so angry today? Why are you suffering today? They'll say, I am this way. I am. My mind and body are this way because of that person, that circumstance, that condition in my life is causing me to feel and think this way.

[00:16:55.680] - Speaker 1
The way I'm thinking and feeling about that person or that problem is actually that my response is weakening me as an organism. And the stronger the emotion I feel to that circumstance or that problem to that person, the more I'm giving them my attention. And where you place your attention is where you place your energy, right? So now you're giving your power away to change. And we would say then you're meeting that problem, that circumstance, that person from the same level of consciousness every single day. And you can't resolve that problem or that circumstance from the same level of consciousness. You got to resolve it from a different level of conscience, from a greater level of consciousness or unconsciousness that has created that problem. So for the most part, the outer environment appears to be real because our senses plug us into this three-dimensional world. As long as we're thinking and feeling equal to everything that's known in our life, our life stays the same. Now, that may be okay, but what if you want to create something new and you're addicted to some emotion that's causing you to feel the anger or feel the suffering that's connected to that person or circumstance?

[00:18:03.700] - Speaker 1
It's very hard to believe in the future that you're creating if you're feeling the emotion of the past, because the emotion of the past is causing you to believe in the story of the past. And 50% of that story isn't even the truth. People are reliving a miserable life they never even had just because they can't change. Then there's a process of a biological death that has to go on where you have to go. If I'm really going to create something new in my life, then I have to overcome in order to become that person. I got to overcome the story, the memory, the belief, the behavior, the emotion that's keeping me in the past. If I'm addicted to it, there's going to be withdrawals. People go on bad trips. They got to stop telling the story of their past, and they got to start telling the story of their future. The only way that we could actually believe in that story of our future is when we feel the emotion of that future. We discovered that when you combine that clear intention, coherent brain, with an elevated emotion, coherent heart, there's a substantial change in your biology as well as your energy.

[00:19:16.480] - Speaker 1
If you keep doing that over and over again, the stronger the emotion you feel about that future, the more you're remembering, and you're creating a long-term memory. Biologically, it looks exactly the same as remembering the past, but now you're remembering the future. So then, is it possible then that we can change our inner world to look like the event has already occurred neurologically and biologically, epigenetically? So much so that you're feeling the emotions of your future, that you no longer are looking for it. You only look for it like, where is it when you feel separate from it? If you feel like your future has already happened.

[00:19:58.220] - Speaker 2
You already have it.

[00:19:59.370] - Speaker 1
You already Now, get ready. Because this is when the synchronicities, the coincidences, the opportunities, you know this very well, you live this. The door's open. The universe is telling you you're connected, you're in the creative process, and we're here to support the act. Then is it possible then that the consciousness of any new reality, the awareness of any new possibility, the The thought fixed in the mind and held in the heart of anything, of any circumstance, of any condition, is the actual thing itself. That's the inner world. Then can we Continuously then invest our attention and invest our energy into a future that we haven't seen or experienced yet. But we've thought about enough times in our mind that our brain has literally changed to look like the event has already occurred.

[00:21:02.660] - Speaker 2
Well, what comes up for me that's really interesting, I never thought about this before, but hearing you say that is the reason we want the thing, whatever it is, whatever the object of desire is, isn't really for the thing. It's for the feeling we get from having the thing. It's the end product. If we can skip to the feeling of having it, in some ways, the physical becomes moot.

[00:21:28.020] - Speaker 1
Why? Because you're doing it For the experience that produces the emotion, to take away the lack or separation from not having it.

[00:21:35.130] - Speaker 2
The emotion is the goal.

[00:21:37.020] - Speaker 1
It's the reward. It's the reward of the experience. When you feel abundant, when you feel unlimited, when you feel whole from the experience. But in the quantum, it's a different set of rules. We have to feel it in order to experience it. Then we have to move out of lack and separation. When a person combines that clear intention, and falls in love with the future event before it happens, the body, as the unconscious mind, is so objective, it does not know the difference between the real-life experience that's creating the emotion and the emotion that we're fabricating by thought alone. The body is believing it's living in a nurturing, loving environment. And if the environment signals the gene, and it does, and the end product of the experience in the environment is the emotion. We're actually signaling the gene head of the environment, and genes make proteins. And proteins are responsible for the structure and function of our body. And the expression of proteins is the expression of life. And the body looks like the experience has already happened. Okay, now, if there's physical evidence in the brain and body to look like the event has already occurred, then you've already had the experience.

[00:22:54.150] - Speaker 1
That means you can't wait for your healing to feel whole in gratitude. You have to actually feel wholeness and gratitude for your healing to begin. You can't wait for your wealth to feel abundance. That would be the old model of cause and effect. You would have to feel abundance ahead of the actual experience to generate wealth.

[00:23:14.700] - Speaker 2
It's really effect and cause of how it works.

[00:23:17.780] - Speaker 1
Exactly. It's the inverse of how we've been doing it because the way we create in three-dimensional reality, as we create based on lack and separation, you see the sports car, you see the house, you see the wardrobe, you see the scarf, you see the vacation that you don't have, and the brain gets busy creating. I want that experience. The problem in three-dimensional reality is if you play by the rules of Newtonian physics, because there's separation, there's me, local in space and time. I'm conscious that I'm Joe Dispenza, and then there's the experience that I want to have, and the brain automatically, as a forecaster, as a predictor of reality, defaults to predict It's going to predict the future based on what it knows in the past. It says, Okay, you got to work this many hours. You got to save this amount of money. You got to make these sacrifices. You got to do this extra thing. You got to do these things because in three-dimensional reality, in order to create If you don't create anything, you have to do something. The doing takes a lot of energy, and it takes a lot of time.

[00:24:22.800] - Speaker 1
Then when we have the experience of the vacation, when we have the experience of our whatever, the experience of having the vacation takes away the lack of not having it. But some people never actually create the things they want in their life, and they spend their whole life living in lack and living in separation. That's the old model of cause and effect. The new model is causing an effect, like you said. Can I change my energy and the experiment to hold the vision of my future and maintain this modified state of mind and body for my entire day? And if I do, will Will there begin to become feedback in my life to let me know that I'm in constant communication with an unseen power or intelligence that really wants to co-create with us? Now, in order for us to do that, we have to lay down the very thing we used our whole life to get what we want for something greater to occur. And that's not something that you learn in one swing. It becomes a process of trial and error. And so the overcoming of the lack, the overcoming of the personality that's connected to the past and its story, is actually the becoming process.

[00:25:38.940] - Speaker 1
That's exactly what our data shows. Our data shows that at the end of a seven-day event, if a person is continuously Previously, we're visiting that dream of their future, there's substantial changes that take place in every biological system in their body, including their brain and heart. Their body looks like they're living in a completely different environment. Genetically, thousands of are upregulated to suggest that they're living in a whole new life. Thousands of metabolites are upregulated for growth, for repair, for regeneration. The body is out of survival. It wants to move back into homeostasis. It wants to flourish. The brain grows. We have data to show that advanced meditators have bigger brains. They have more connectivity. There's more order. There's more information that's being exchanged. The heart, after the seven-day event ends, the person is moving. It's a greater levels of HRV, heart rate variability, as a consequence of this experience. The person who immerses themselves fully in their dream, and it's so much easier to forget the vision than to remember it. That means we got to take time away from everyone and everything to just get our brain back into that vision of the future.

[00:26:51.140] - Speaker 1
Because the moment in our lives, you default and you see some person or some circumstance that pushes your button and you feel the emotion, you will You'll no longer believe in that future. You'll default and seamlessly move back to the memory of the past, and we're disconnected from that future. We can't say it's that person or that circumstance that's causing us to be this way, because then we would buy into the old model of reality being the victim of our environment that is controlling our thoughts and feelings. We do that. It's not bad. But the question is, how long are you going to do that for? Because sooner or later, you got to go, I got to stop doing that.

[00:27:24.440] - Speaker 2
Most people don't even know they're in that constant tug of war. They just think that's how it is.

[00:27:30.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. I think that's how we've been programmed. That's 95% of who we are by the time we're in the middle of our life. It's so much easier to go unconscious. What we discovered is the only way you get really good at becoming conscious is when you catch yourself from going unconscious. People think, Oh, I'm doing my meditation wrong because my mind is wandering here. No, you're doing it right. That's exactly how you weed the garden. You catch yourself going there, you become conscious, you're going unconscious, you return back to the present moment. It takes energy and awareness to do that. And the body goes, I don't like this. I want to quit. I want to get up. I want to go. It gets agitated, gets aroused. More people go, I can't meditate. Settle the body back down. Tell it's no longer the mind that you're the mind. Do that enough. Time sooner or later, the animal starts to relax into the present moment, and there's a liberation of energy. The emotion that's stored in the body as information is being liberated into the field. We're going particle to wave, matter to energy. We're freeing ourselves from the chains of the familiar past and the predictable future.

[00:28:33.860] - Speaker 1
The body can actually relax into the unknown, and that goes so against thousands of years of conditioning in biology because we're wired for survival, and there's better chances of surviving when you run from the unknown, right? It goes counterintuitive to our biology, but yet, if you stay at it for just a few days, you get really good at being present, and it becomes a skill. The more you practice being present, the better you get at it. You get so good at it that you can actually like being in the unknown. And that's when the veneer starts to drop, right? Nothing bad is going to happen. In survival, we're always imagining the worst case scenario because we got to prepare for the worst. And then we tend to feel the emotion of what it would feel like if it would happen to get ready for the event. And we're changing our brain and body to become conditioned into anxiety. And you can program it subconsciously to such a degree that the body You can automatically have a panic attack. Try as you may to control it with your conscious mind. You've programmed it subconsciously. So the person who heals from that condition of panic attacks, that's exactly what they do.

[00:29:43.540] - Speaker 1
And we have hundreds, if not thousands of scans of people, of all professions, of all parts of the world. All they're doing is catching themselves, going to that worst case scenario and returning back to the present moment and settling the body down from that emotional state. And the body bucks and kicks like an It's the unbridal stallion. It wants its way. It's the mind. It's been conditioned to be that way. And yet if you stay with it and you keep returning back to the present moment, sooner or later, the body acquiesces. It surrenders to a new mind. The leader is back. Most people would rather get on their cell phone. They'd rather scroll, they'd rather get up and do something, take something, watch something to take away that emptyness. If a person is willing to immerse themselves in that process, we see that the people have dramatic changes in their biology at the end of seven days.

[00:30:35.200] - Speaker 2
Tell me about how you came to the seven-day program.

[00:30:38.280] - Speaker 1
Well, first of all, I never planned on doing any of this, honestly. It was only when people started asking, How do you do it? It's a time in history, I think, where it's not enough to know. It's a time in history to know how. Twenty years ago, it was very much dinner conversation. It was arguments of philosophy and theory and intellectual understanding of things. Now people want to take that philosophy and they want to do something with it. I thought it would be really great to demystify the process because, for example, the people in this work that heal, they don't do their meditations to heal. They do their meditations to change. They understand that when they change, they heal. When I started studying spontaneous remissions and I found out all the commonalities with people that had remissions, I thought maybe we could replicate the model because that's what they were doing, is that they were literally changing. From one personality to another personality to such a degree, they would tell you, Oh, the disease exists in that person. I'm somebody else. I wanted to demystify the process. I think for the first couple of years, we didn't really see much happen.

[00:31:43.970] - Speaker 1
We just saw people at the end of a one-day or two-day event. They felt better. Their well-being was better, but we didn't see anybody have dramatic change. That went on for about two years, and all of a sudden, we started seeing people with MS step out of wheelchairs, people with ALS have more motor function, people with food allergies that could only send foods. They were eating all the food they wanted again. There was an upregulation that was taking place, and sometimes it would happen right before my eyes. The human in me was like, yay. But the analytical, scientifically-minded person is like, If that happened, how did that happen? The person sitting there with their eyes closed, how could they downregulate the gene for MS and upregulate the gene for health with their eyes closed without any experience from their environment? Maybe there's an inward experience that's going on that's changing their biology. We were doing one-day events, and then people kept saying, Can you do another event? Can you just started doing two-day events, then two-day in one evening. Then we did a level one, and a level two, and a level three, and a level four.

[00:32:51.800] - Speaker 1
It just kept going. Got to a point where I said to them, I don't know anything else. Then I started to have mystical experiences, and then that opened mind to other things. But when we started doing the measurements, we were so surprised to see like, Oh, my God, there's really things happening in people's brains and hearts, and their genes, and in their immune system. Then we started elongating the events to do four days in one evening, and we did tons of scientific studies, and right around that fourth day, people are having transcendental experiences, mystical experiences that change the way they saw themselves in their life, in their past and their world. We were sitting in a meeting and I said, What if we did seven days? We've done four days. They're just breaking through. To see what happens. Yeah, this is like Saturday and Sunday, the group is breaking through. The seven days, what would happen if they broke through in three or four. What could we measure at the end of seven days? We've done 58 week-long events now. Wow. Yeah. Since I've been... That's amazing. I spent a year of my life in a ballroom.

[00:34:00.740] - Speaker 1
Now, just last year, our community said, What would happen if we did a 10-day? And I was like, Come on, no way. We did our first 10-day event in Cancun in December of last year. Once again, we measured some things again. And of course, there's going to be more evolution of the species because what we discovered is when you get a collective group of people together that want to really improve themselves themselves and improve their lives and get them in a state of creation, relaxed and awake. And they all behave in the same way. They do the same things. They're exposed to the same information. They learn that information. They practice applying it. When people behave in that similar way, independent of what individual genotype they have, and genes make proteins, right? At the end of seven days, when they behave in the same way, the emergent consciousness that's created is being reflected in their biology to such a degree that 80% of the tribe, the herd, the flock, are all signaling the same genes and making the same protein. That means the collective consciousness that's living in love, that's living in possibility, that's living in the state of creation, that's more orderly, more coherent, more regulated into balance.

[00:35:27.490] - Speaker 1
Stress is autonomic dysregulation. This is more regulation. That there's an emerging consciousness that's reflected in their biology where the entire community is biologically changing in seven days. We're like, what would happen in 10 days? Of course, you see more of that take place.

[00:35:47.900] - Speaker 2
If you were to do a one-on-one for seven days versus having 2,000 people for seven days, the fact that it's 2,000 people doing it amplifies it for everybody.

[00:36:02.900] - Speaker 1
I mean, I get asked to do private events all the time, and many of them I turn down because there's something magical that happens. It's transcendent of our typical senses, but you come to the event and something palpable, you can feel there's so much energy in the room. I'll give you two examples of this that really blew my mind. At that 10-day event in Cancun, we hooked up 700 people to measure their heart rate variability over the course of seven days. We had 265, maybe 267 people that were healthy people. That pretty much had healthy HRV, heart rate variability measurements. Then we divided the rest of the group with different health conditions into different categories, depression, anxiety, PTSD, cancer, etc. Our early data, when we look at 10 days of these people wearing their HRV monitors, from the very beginning of the event, as an example, depressed people have a very specific signature that's different than a healthy person, HRV-wise. Every single meditation of those depressed people had the exact same heart signature as the healthy controls. Now, the The probability of that happening, that's called murmuration in biology, where you see the flock of birds, the school of fish, synchronized.

[00:37:37.100] - Speaker 1
The probability of that happening is about zero. Our mathematicians, our Taiwanese, mathematicians, cardiologists, they wrote, The event is too good. That's what they said, Too much synchronization. We've never seen anything like that. There's this median entrainment of order where the strong, the healthy are lifting the weak. And by the end of the 10-day event, the depressed people's signatures with their eyes open were entrained to the collective. That is outstanding because there's a non-local effect that's taking place in the collective network. So that's one thing. When we do healings on others, and we do those and people heal when they understand the technique that we use, when It's no longer about us, and it's about giving life to another person's life. It's about loving another person into life. The act of giving opens the heart. It actually releases oxytocin. When we do these coherence healings, we have random event generators in the room spread out along the room. And think of a random event generator as a sophisticated coin toss. And it tosses a coin about a thousand times in a second. And the more you flip When you flip a coin, it's going to be heads or tails.

[00:39:02.760] - Speaker 1
The machine is programmed for one and a zero. The more you flip it, the more it's going to be fifty-fifty. So fifty-fifty is pretty much what a random effect is when there's nobody in the room. Put the machines in there and you just see it just may go head, head, head, head, tail, tail, tail, head, tail, head, tail, tail, tail, head. But it's fifty-fifty. Over time. Over time. It balances out. When we do the coherence healings in the room and there's a palpable of people. There's reverence, there's power, there's love. The tribe is coming together, and we're going to produce an effect on one of the tribe. It says model language. Those random event generators go absolutely crazy. They just go, 011, 1111, 1111, 1111, they go right outside of normal. So collective networks of observers with brain and heart coherence. The signature of order, the more coherence, the more clear the information. Direct directed towards another human to affect their field, to create new information in their field, somehow causes random events become less random and more orderly. It's collective networks of observers that determine reality. It's not the number of people. It's not the amount of energy.

[00:40:17.120] - Speaker 1
It could be a stadium full of people. It would be an entropic energy. It's the most coherent signal. The more orderly the signal, the greater the effect. Now, the scientists that do the research, they're always because it's outside of the materialistic model. So one scientist says, Okay, let's take one of them and let's wrap them in a Faraday cage, which is basically copper and nickel and lead to block what? Electromagnetic energy. And so the other ones in the room are going off the scale, and the one that's blocked with the fabric and the box that has the metals in it is behaving normally. Now, we know that it must be some electromagnetic field. The heart being the magnetic charge, the brain being the electrical charge. Electromagnetic field, right? Just like an X-ray, you go get an X-ray, you see your dentist, and they put the lead apron on you. That's the block the radiation from entering your body. In the same fashion, we block the radiation that was created not from any machine. From people. From people, the vitalism of order that's created when there's a march and a cadence where a person is saying, Okay, someone in the tribe needs energy.

[00:41:32.340] - Speaker 1
And what we see in the Coherence healings, we see the greatest biological changes take place both in the healer as well as the healer. We've seen blind people see, I know this sounds hard for me to believe at times. A deaf people here, people that couldn't speak, speaks people with stage 4 cancer. Spread to their bones.

[00:41:52.460] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the setup for the healing. What does it look like? A group of people healing one.

[00:41:56.910] - Speaker 1
Okay, you got to imagine 2,500 people, right? Okay. There's a pool that's created for a person that wants a healing from a chronic health condition. Then we have a random machine, because it's science, that randomly chooses the people. There's an iteration that happens once, and then there's a second iteration to choose the rest. Then once they're selected, they're brought into the ballroom and they're laid down on their back. There's eight chairs that's placed around, sometimes six, sometimes seven. The number is not important, but between six and eight people are surrounding that person.

[00:42:34.480] - Speaker 2
So the healer. There are six or eight healers. Healers. And one person in the center.

[00:42:39.520] - Speaker 1
In the center. To be healed. Yeah. The healers are outside, and they're doing a standing meditation where they're changing their state. They're changing their energy. They're getting coherent.

[00:42:52.820] - Speaker 2
Are they doing it together as a group?

[00:42:55.340] - Speaker 1
Yes, they're standing outside in the foyer.

[00:42:57.780] - Speaker 2
But is it an internal? Yes. Are they Are they focused only internally on themselves or are they focused on the group?

[00:43:03.450] - Speaker 1
No, just getting their energy right. They have to be the right-The individual energy, right? Individual, yeah. Because they're going to fly with the flock. I understand. They got to be synchronized. There's a standing meditation. We used to do walking meditation. We do a standing one now, where it's about a 15, 20-minute meditation, eyes closed, and I'm talking to them in their ear, and I'm getting them in that state. At the same time they're doing that, I'm in the ballroom with the people that are laying down, and they have to also be in a state of Receivership. Gratitude tends to be the ultimate state of receiver-ship. When you receive something that's joyful to you or when something happens to you that's wonderful, the end product of that experience, the emotion that's created is called gratitude. When you receive something, you feel grateful. Gratitude is that state of receivership. I work with them to get them in that state where they're grateful to receive, and I talk to them and get them in that state. Then the door's open and people walk in and there's volunteers, and it's got to be synchronized. I'm not waiting for anybody.

[00:44:04.780] - Speaker 1
I can't risk the room filling too slowly because if the person's saying, Oh, my back hurts. How long is this going to go? There can't be any distraction. I lost them. They're matter trying to change matter, and they're going to exert a very little effect. But if I can get them in that state where they come in and everybody's coming in, they're on purpose and they're walking through those doors and they're the mind of the healer. Sometimes they start with their hands their heart, and they start standing behind the chairs. And sometimes the first one they stand, we do three in a row, three days in a row. The second one, they typically sit, but now their hands are over their heart. Once the room fills, I come in. And I get them to that point where they get beyond space and time. They get to that invisible field of energy and information called the quantum field that tends to be more unifying. And Einstein said, The field is the sole governing agent of the particle. The field controls the particle. He didn't say the particle controls the particle. If we're going to affect the field of the person to affect their body, we have to get to the field.

[00:45:09.480] - Speaker 1
The process of dissociating from everything physical, everything material, to take your attention off your body, off everything in your environment, and off of time, the predictor of future. Just energy. Just become pure consciousness. In that void, in that vacuum, it's rich in frequency and energy, and everything's connected, and they're trained all week to do this. Once Once they're beyond their identity in three-dimensional reality, and they are pure consciousness, and they feel connected to that energy, then the next thing to do is they have to get in their heart because the energy of the heart is the glue that holds all of matter together. So then there's a process where they move into their heart. Once energy moves into the heart, we know, based on all our research, it goes to the brain. They bring their hands together, and then they administer, they open their hands very slowly, and they're producing a coherent field of energy in the field of the person who's laying there. Now, I'm going to digress for a minute here because I want to just explain a little bit of the science, because this sounds, for some people, a little bit of a stretch.

[00:46:14.460] - Speaker 1
But there was a researcher in the 1940s at Yale University that was studying electromagnetic fields around living organisms. And he studied electromagnetic fields around all types of eggs, insect eggs, spider eggs, bird eggs, chicken eggs, reptiles, of reptiles, snakes, amphibians, all types of eggs. And what he found was 100% of the time, the positive charge was always where the head was, and the negative charge was always where the tail was. The positive charge on one end, the negative charge on the other, you have a magnet. And he discovered that there's an invisible electromagnetic field around the living organism just like a magnet. You can't see it, but you can measure it just like a magnet it exists. And there's a field around the magnet in the same way. So then he just progressed his studies to studying more complex living organisms. And ultimately, he came across the human beings, and he started measuring the electromagnetic field around human beings. And he did a study where he was studying women with uterine cancer, a propensity for uterine cancer, genetic propensity. And he wanted to study the field around the organ as well as around the body.

[00:47:24.380] - Speaker 1
And when he found the women that were diagnosed with uterine cancer, the ones that were diagnosed, Almost 100% of those women had a very specific pattern in their electromagnetic field. But there were a certain percentage of women that didn't have uterine cancer but had the pattern in the field. As if they had the cancer.

[00:47:45.460] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:47:46.380] - Speaker 1
Every single one of those women that had the pattern in the field ultimately developed uterine cancer. And he said, Oh, my God. I thought matter was creating this field. No, no, no, no. It's this field that's informing matter. If I can change the information in that person's field, can I stop them from getting uterine cancer? If I can change the field, could I change matter? Well, that's what Einstein said, right? So that's exactly what we do. The tumor, the disease, it's incidental. It's the projection, the hologram in three-dimensional reality. If I swim upstream and I come to the epiphenomenon of matter and I can change the information in the field of the person who's laying there, and I have a coherent brain and a coherent heart, that means I could create a more orderly pattern of information in the field. If I can do that to such a degree where eight people are resonating and tuning in and doing the same thing, we could actually change the information in the field to change the destiny of matter. And that's exactly what we start seeing happen with people with all different chronic health conditions. I mean, people with Parkinson's disease, all kinds of crazy conditions.

[00:48:58.060] - Speaker 1
All of a sudden, there it is, and now it's gone. Now, here's the coolest part about it all. The majority of people who are doing the healing feel a level of love that they've never felt before. And the person who's receiving the healing, if there's a connection, experiences a level of love that they've never felt in their entire life. And when they stand and talk about the change that's taking place, the majority of them will never I tell you, Oh, yeah, I had this health condition, and now it's gone. They don't even talk about that. It's incidental. They cannot stop talking about the experience. When we study the language of transformation, we study the language of language specialists from universities that study this, it's such an amazing phenomenon because the experience, the most common thing that people say is, I felt it. Like, I felt. And yet those people are not even being touched. There's no physical contact with them. They're just... Their matter is being vibrated to a greater frequency. Their matter is being lifted. And all disease is a lowering of frequency. There's a level of order that's taking place down to the atomic level.

[00:50:16.220] - Speaker 1
The atom is doing it, the molecule is doing it, the chemical is doing it, the cell is doing it, the tissue is doing it, the organ is doing it, the system is, the whole entire body is being irradiated with light. So the common word is feel it. I love how it's divided into two feel it. One is very somatic. I felt every single cell of my body vibrating. My top of my head blew off. My heart turned on like an engine. It's very somatic. Then the other part is it's very emotional. I never felt love like that. I know it wasn't love because it's a different love. It was a connection? No. Was it bliss? I don't know. It felt really good. I felt like I remembered what I once forgot. I remember this is who I am. There's an instantaneous biological upgrade that takes place because we could say, in a sense, that the love that they're feeling in that moment is literally dragging the body right out of the past into the present moment. And when their heart does that, this is the other thing that I failed to mention earlier, the second thing is that the other function of the heart, when it moves into that filled state of energy, it tells the brain the trauma is over.

[00:51:37.040] - Speaker 1
It tells the brain the past is over. The abuse, the betrayal, the violation, the shock, diagnosis, somehow there's a reset in the baseline in the amygdala of the brain, in the survival center. And the person on some level views their past from this elegant state like, Oh, all of this This had to happen. Oh, this is perfect because it brought me where? To this. And now all of that makes sense. And that's the moment the past no longer exists. In fact, some people say, I don't want to change anything in my past. Oh, the people that abused me, the people that did this to me, I love them. I would have never gotten here. They see it from a greater level of consciousness. And I think that's forgiveness. That's really what forgiveness is. Forgiveness is when you feel something so good that you don't want to feel that anymore. And if you're not feeling that feeling, you're no longer giving that person your attention. So that's energy coming back to you. And there's energy to heal. There's energy that's coming back to your field. There's energy to create. There's energy to thrive. There's energy for the mystical.

[00:52:48.580] - Speaker 1
When the person comes back to their identity, in a sense, they're in a new body. They got an upgrade. They're in a whole new life. Their life is completely different. They're in a whole new They're not on that timeline, genetically, where they were headed with their diagnosis or whatever. The language specialist did a week-long event, and he had a transcendental moment. He zoomed me and he said, Now, I'm the language specialist, and I don't have a language to describe what happened. It's ineffable. It's ineffable. I think we need more of those because that's when the veil, that's when the hypnosis, that's when the conditioning, that's when the programming is removed and we see reality how it really is. Yes.

[00:53:33.720] - Speaker 2
The healing that you're describing sounds modern and you use technology to prove the way it's working. But I can't help imagine that once upon a time, that was the way people healed.

[00:53:50.330] - Speaker 1
What else was there?

[00:53:51.520] - Speaker 2
Don't you think?

[00:53:52.330] - Speaker 1
Of course. I mean, you had certain elements in nature that was passed on through culture and tradition. Through experience that work for that culture. But my interest is to demystify the process and not use the language of 2,000 or 5,000 years, because that was the language of that time. We would divide community if we did that.

[00:54:15.830] - Speaker 2
But in our materialist society, it's viewed as impossible. But I think it's historical and ordinary.

[00:54:24.720] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[00:54:25.420] - Speaker 2
We've just lost it. Exactly. We've lost the understanding.

[00:54:28.820] - Speaker 1
Let's go a step further because we've lost our true nature, our connection to one another in connection to nature. Let's stretch the model a little further. When COVID happened, and we couldn't run events any longer, and we couldn't do the coherence healings. And by the way, our statistics in an in-person coherence healing before COVID was 38% of the people that were getting a healing got an 8, 9, or 10 out of 10 change in their body. That's outstanding, right? That's better than any pharmacology right now.

[00:55:02.190] - Speaker 2
Un Unbelievable. And no downside, no-The research shows that there's no side effects.

[00:55:08.700] - Speaker 1
For sure, no side effects. My job is to get the community better at it. I want to get the 50% so we can walk into a children's hospital and say, We got the data. We're going to go in and help your kids. That's what we want to do. Covid happens and you can't run events. And so a group of our community said, Okay, if this quantum field is an invisible field of energy and frequency and information that exists beyond our senses, beyond three-dimensional reality, beyond space and time, where there's more order, where everything's connected, then we don't really need to be in the room if we're in the quantum, because all we need is a coordinate. We need a target. We need a picture. Can we do a remote coherence healing and change that person's field? Because the field is not over there where we think he is if he's in Sri Lanka and the rest of the healers are spread around the globe, which they are, in their bedrooms or in their living room, all lining up at the same time. If we're truly in the quantum, he's a thought away. We'll just change this field in the field where everything's connected.

[00:56:13.020] - Speaker 1
And we did a study, a double-blind placebo study, where we got a group of healers work with people that were diagnosed with PTSD. They did health surveys and we took all their measurements. We found a website called, This Person exist. Com, where the AI or the machine learning makes a face of a person that isn't a real face. We had to do a blind study in order to make it a scientific study. Long story short, at the end of this study, it was six weeks, I think it was, 90% of the people that had PTSD that were treating conventionally and unconventionally who still had PTSD. At the end of that Six Week study, 90% of them no longer have PTSD. Now, the scientists are really bothered by this. They'll tell the audience, I don't know how this works. I can't say... The materialist has a lot of trouble with this. But you would have to really come to the point. I keep saying to them, What does this mean? It means we're all connected. We're all connected. Now, think about the healers who show up every day and do the healing. They're doing They're doing it for what?

[00:57:30.900] - Speaker 1
They're doing it for the experience of healing another person. Now, what we do in those remote groups, which is so important, once a month, the people who were healed, the mother who's child who had autism or birth trauma that comes on and says, I just want to thank the group. My child, for the first time, made eye contact with her brothers, was smiling and giggling. My son, who has autism, is no longer defecating at night, is no longer urinating in the bed, sleeps through the night, takes naps, wants to go to school, held my hand in the shower, told me, mommy, I love you. I just want to say thank you. Thank you so much for changing our lives. Not only you changed my son's life, you changed my life, you changed my family's life. We all changed from this feeling. Thank you. And tears of joy are running down the face. And the greatest form of gratitude we will ever receive is when we receive gratitude. So you look at the 70 people on the Zoom call, and We're all in tears because the experience of healing one member in the tribe, something innate.

[00:58:38.180] - Speaker 2
It elevates everyone.

[00:58:39.220] - Speaker 1
Something innate wakens in us, Rick. We're celebrating both. We change someone in the tribe, and we're changed from the experience. And that experience produces an emotion that's greater than any sports car, greater than any wardrobe. There's something that wakens in us. And that's when we tend to bond and come together. That's an experience in the unknown that's producing an emotion that's new, that's awe, that's wonder, whatever that emotion is, is our natural state of being. That's who we really are when we're not divided as a culture because of stress and survival.

[00:59:15.020] - Speaker 2
It has to be tremendously empowering to feel that. The fact that you participate in something and what seems to be magic happens. True healing. Yeah. Really beautiful.

[00:59:30.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Really beautiful. I think that you can get better at it. Now we're just starting to work with children, both in person and remotely with autism. It's amazing what we're seeing. It's really cool.

[00:59:41.440] - Speaker 2
The new movie is called Source. Source, yeah. How would you describe Source?

[00:59:45.200] - Speaker 1
I think source is a great way to explain the work to a person who has difficulty in understanding exactly what we do. In other words, people who come to our events and they say, I don't know how to explain this to my husband or my spouse. It's a great way to combine the science of what we're discovering about the idea that we are greater than we think. In fact, our data is always greater than we think. We're always amazed at our data. Surprised by it. Yeah. But the effects aren't like 10% of the population is getting 1% change or two standard deviation change in the right temporal lobe. It's too much. It's like it's 78%, it's 82%, it's 84%, it's 90%, it's A hundred %. You see that data, and it's happening in seven days. For the analytical person, rational person who's having difficulty with this, because I have difficulty with it, too. But combine the documentary with stories, of true stories of human beings that had cystic fibrosis, that had cancer, that had anxiety, that are totally relatable, that no longer have the condition any longer. There's nothing like a good story. It's the four-minute mile.

[01:01:00.000] - Speaker 1
You're looking at truth, right? You're looking at evidence. Then you combine the story of transformation with the science, the evidence, and evidence is the loudest voice. The documentary was created so that it could help explain the work in a way that typically is difficult for a person to explain because it's like you're trying to explain what a mango tastes like. Experience is the best professor. You got to jump in and you got to get into it. What's happened since Source, though, is we've done so much other research that we have to do a docuseries for the microbiome, for endogenous opioids, for neurogenesis, for all these pair young people with old people and brain changes and cognitive changes. We have all this new data that we're discovering. So source was our first shot as saying, basically, you're greater than you think, and your nervous system can manufacture a pharmacy of chemicals that can work better than any drug. That's what our data says. I mean, the best drug usually is about 25% efficacy. You're getting to 80, 84%.

[01:02:01.740] - Speaker 2
With no downside.

[01:02:03.050] - Speaker 1
With no side, with no downside. So hopefully it captures people's attention just to really understand that we are greater than we think.

[01:02:10.540] - Speaker 2
There's a line at the beginning of the movie, a quote, where you say, In the age of information, ignorance is a choice. It's a beautiful line.

[01:02:21.020] - Speaker 1
I think what information has done for us is it's given us the ability to bypass authority. You typically needed a priest, you needed a rabbi, you needed a governor, you needed a doctor, you needed some expert, some authority that held information and disseminated that information to people. Now we have the information at our fingertips. If you want to learn anything, you can be your own instructor. If the medical model is collapsing, if the journalistic model is collapsing, if an education educational model is collapsing, if the environment is collapsing, you have access to that information, you can be informed. And now that you're informed, you can make a better choice. And so as an example, in that documentary, what I wanted to say was people do the best with what they think is available. If they're unexposed to the information, they're going to take the conventional route because that's all they know. Based on their consciousness or their awareness of what's possible, their realm of choices are within convention. There may be some other ones that are outside of convention that are conventional. But when the chemo isn't working and the radiation isn't working, the surgeries didn't work, and the drug trial didn't work, and the diet didn't work, and the ketogenic, and the organic, and the gluten-free, none of that worked.

[01:03:48.850] - Speaker 1
You're left with yourself and your belief in yourself, this is something different. So when you see a person stand on the stage, our stage testimonials in the last six months has It's disturbed me a lot. A lot has changed my belief in what's humanly possible. Like, I stay up at night thinking about it. When you see that person on the stage tell their story, they're the example of truth, right? That's the four-minute mile. They're broke through a certain level of consciousness or unconsciousness. Whether they had a brain tumor, whether they had a tumor in their spine, whether they had stage 4 cancer, whether they had Parkinson's, whatever it is, they tell their story and they're completely transformed. There's no evidence of any disease. They don't look like a vegetarian, and they don't look particularly in shape, and they don't look young, and they're not dressed like-Ordinary. Just ordinary. You pass them at Whole Foods. Walk right past them, and they're telling their story. I'm watching the audience, and 100% of the people are leaning in. They're witnessing light. They are witnessing truth. And now, the person who has the cancer, who's in the audience, who's looking at that person, listening to that story, is relating with that person.

[01:04:58.040] - Speaker 1
And now they're becoming conscious of another possibility, and that's new information. And if the collective becomes conscious of another possibility, just like an infection spreads amongst a community and creates disease, health and wellness becomes as infectious as disease. Now we see five people with Reinhardt syndrome. Because one person had it, they're healed in one week. Five people with spinal cord injuries, one person standing up because they were in a wheelchair, now they're out of their wheelchair. We have four other people at the end of the event. One person blind.

[01:05:30.520] - Speaker 2
It's the hardest for the first person to do it. But once the first person does it-Just like a four-minute mile.

[01:05:35.440] - Speaker 1
There's a footprint. The information now is causing the person to choose something other. The person may say in the audience, Well, Theoretically, I believe this is the truth. I've seen the testimonials, I saw the documentary. I just didn't believe that it could work for me. This is a very big moment. This is the moment where the person chooses loses themselves and steps out of the bleachers onto the playing field. That means if they believe in possibility, they have to believe in themselves. And if they believe in themselves, they have to believe in possibility. Now, listen, they can continue treating conventionally or unconventionally But if they start doing the work and they start changing, when they start changing, they're going to start healing. And yeah, in the beginning, they may just sleep better. Through the night, they may have less pain, they may have more energy. Okay, the body is changing. Their blood values may still be the same. Their scans may not change. But when the person says, I went nine months, I went 13 months, I went two years in two months, I never missed the day. I just kept changing, I kept changing, I kept changing.

[01:06:43.120] - Speaker 1
I started getting better. Then I started, if I I was reacting to my ex or to my coworker, emotionally, I was seamlessly returning back to my old personality. I had to practice doing it with my eyes open. I got to get really good at doing it with my eyes open as much as I can do with my eyes closed. Their story, there's so many jewels. But the reality is that it took them 13 months for a nine-inch tumor on their kidney to finally disappear. And they're telling the story. It's very It's impractical. It's not like Amazon Prime, one and done. Where is my healing? It's not like that. They understand that they had to change. They had to get their body back regulated into order. They knew it worked. And if they didn't show up, to do the meditation, then they didn't believe it was possible. So they never missed the day. And that transcends all the things that people say, I'm too old, I'm too out of shape, I had too rough of a path, I never meditated before, I'm too sick. You can't say any of that stuff any longer. You either choose yourself or you don't.

[01:07:48.640] - Speaker 1
So there's such great information in the story where you have to question your own belief. And that's exactly what those testimonials in the last six months has done for me. I've just been in awe. I've had to watch some of them 50 times over because I cannot believe it. It's unbelievable. That's exactly the information that we need for people to make a better choice about themselves and their health.

[01:08:15.850] - Speaker 2
For you, it didn't start theoretical because for you, it started, you had an accident, and you were able to heal yourself in a way that doctors told you could never happen. Is this true?

[01:08:29.080] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it It was in the '80s where you basically didn't say to the doctor, I'm not going to have surgery. I'm not going to do what you ask me to do. I think that was my wake-up call. I really couldn't imagine living my life with rods in my spine from the base of my neck to the base of my spine and living on addictive medication, spending my whole life trying to get away from the pain and not being able to do the things I wanted to do. They told me I was going to be paralyzed for the rest of my life anyway, so I thought, I might as well roll the dice. I might as well step into the unknown. I didn't know what I I was doing much, but I just knew that there was an intelligence within us that gives us life, and I was going to make the time to connect to it and show it what I wanted. I think it's very difficult, we know, when you're faced with a trauma or a diagnosis, to focus on what you don't want. It took me six weeks, to be honest with you, to change my mind on that.

[01:09:19.220] - Speaker 1
Once I had my own experience and then studied spontaneous remissions, that kept me interested in this mind-body connection and mind over matter. So it was what started me on this whole journey.

[01:09:32.640] - Speaker 2
I remember reading your experience, and it was mind-blowing, really eye-opening. And in the same way that the people who get on stage and tell their story, your story allowed me to understand what was possible. That I wouldn't have known was possible had it not been for your story. Tell me about the heart and the brain and how they relate to each other, how they connect, when they connect. Tell me about that relationship. And is it Is it heart and brain or is it heart and mind?

[01:10:01.900] - Speaker 1
Well, I mean, mind is the brain in action. So whatever you want to call it, for the purpose of the neuroscientific model. You say brain. I think the brain thinks, but the heart knows. I think there's a lot of wisdom in the consciousness of the heart. But when you feel gratitude or you feel true love for something, or you see real beauty or something moves you and you weep in joy, that's an awakening of that center. In A lot of people fight to feel that. Even when they're in public, they don't want to be that vulnerable. Because if you're living in survival, being vulnerable is very dangerous. The jungle is going to say, You're prey if you're vulnerable. So there's protective systems that we have within us that are not conscious, that have been programmed subconsciously, that I believe causes us to not open our hearts. But If you reason with people and you have them understand that if you're truly going to create, you need to get your heart involved. If you're going to believe in that future that you're imagining with all your heart, it better be open and activated because the heart is the magnetic charge.

[01:11:14.940] - Speaker 1
It is the glue, the pattern that's created from the heart. The energy and the glue is actually the blueprint of the experience that you're going to have, and you have to have a coherent heart in order to do that. But it's the magnetic field that draws that experience to us. That's why it's so important to feel the feeling of the future before it happens, because it's that energy that starts to draw reality to us, which means we can't attract anything in our life that we feel separate from. That's the law, right? So the heart is a strong indicator of allowing us to not only feel the feeling of our future, but to be able to memorize that feeling. So much so that no person, no circumstance, no condition would cause us to move back into lack and separation. That's the work, right? That's how the masters figured it out, I believe, anyway. When the brain is coherent, it has very profound electrical signals. The electrical charge is the signal we send out. It's the vision, it's the dream, it's what we're imagining. It's producing information in the field. If the quantum field is an invisible field of energy and information where there's an infinite number of realities, potential possibilities, then the possibility, the reality of your health or your wealth or your love already exists.

[01:12:36.580] - Speaker 1
You just have to become aware of it. It takes a little bit of practice to get the brain coherent and get the heart coherent. But once they get coherent, the relationship between the two neurologically, biologically, chemically, and even energetically tend to be regulated systematized. And so if the heart and the brain are sharing the same energy, they're sharing the same frequency. And if they're coherent, all frequency carries information. Now, this is an important element because the majority of information that we get in our lives comes from our senses, comes from our outer world, comes from three-dimensional reality. It's so easy toLimiting. Yeah, to hypnotize a person into limitation based on the information they're being exposed to. People make choices, as you know, being programmed to behave in a certain way. Okay. Get your heart and brain synchronized. If the brain thinks and the heart knows, then you can get relaxed in your heart and awake in your brain, and the brain and heart are synchronizing, and they're sharing the same energy, and they're sharing the same frequency, the same frequency is carrying the same information. The heart tells the brain exactly what the person needs to hear about themselves in their lives.

[01:14:00.000] - Speaker 1
It's a straight shooter. It does not beat around the bush. It speaks the truth. So now the person, once it's synchronized, is getting information from a very wise part of them, a very reverent, sacred part. They're separating the sacred from the mundane. The heart is informing the brain in its wisdom, and it's our guide now. And so a person who says, I have to make a very difficult decision. This has happened to me, and I have gone against my heart, unfortunately, more times than I've ever needed to. I can tell you that 100% of the time it was right because sometimes it tells you things that you don't want to do. It tells you things that are very inconvenient. It's never going to be the right time. It never is going to be the right time. When the heart informs the brain and gives us its wisdom, it becomes our own compass, our own guide. It's giving us information relevant to Rick, relevant to relevant to you, to the individual. When they're weighing the known against the unknown, and they know they can't go back to the known, that chilling moment where they can't ask their friends or their family because they're not them, that you know that they're not going to get them.

[01:15:14.100] - Speaker 1
The answer they're going to give them is not going to be the right answer. You just know that they're in the river of change, and there's no one that they can rely on. They're left to their own resources. When the heart gives you that direction, you trust that it takes you right where you need to be. We spend a lot of time in our work synchronizing the heart to the brain because we want the person to be having their own wisdom, to be resourceful in a way that they're self-sufficient. And then the second point that's super important is practice makes perfect. And I was guilty of this during COVID. I practiced being relaxed in my heart and awake in my brain. Felt amazing during my meditation. Then I'd get up, and I'd have to do all these things, all these Zoom calls, and I'd At the end of the day, I'd be like, whooped. My environment beat me up. And I was like, Wait, dude. How are you doing? Because you start off at the beginning of your day here, and here's where you end your day. You better start getting good at this with your eyes open.

[01:16:14.240] - Speaker 1
You got to be so good at doing with your eyes closed. You got to do with your eyes open. You got to be able to practice doing this with your eyes open. That's why we started doing all the walking meditations. Eyes open. Now demonstrate, relax in your heart and awake in your mind. Practice with your eyes open, but get a little more attention in Not all of it out there, but check in with you. Make sure you can do that. Instead of stressed out, unconscious and living in a program, practice relaxed and awake. And so the evolution of that is to be able to do it with your eyes open and sustain that state. And the experiment then is, if I can, then I need feedback. I need to see feedback in my life. I need a small breadcrumb, a small synchronicity, a little coincidence, a little something to say, You're doing it. You're doing it. And it could just be something that causes you to smile so that in a sense, you're waking up to a new belief that you're actually the creator of your life instead of the victim of your life. And so we have to practice with our eyes open.

[01:17:14.940] - Speaker 1
Everybody reacts. We all react. The question, though, is, how long? What's the real question? How long are you going to do this for? To dismiss yourself from your life for a moment and say, I've lost it, and to get back in your heart, relaxing your heart and awake in your brain, I think is how greatness is born. Because there'll always be a reason to not do it. There'll be an excuse. It'll be the right time. But when it's the hardest, it matters the most. I think that anything past that point will be easy if you could truly regulate in that moment. You're training your body to stay out of survival. As I said, it's untrained and it wants to fight and run and hide. It takes an enormous amount of energy and awareness to do that. And yet doing it with your eyes open, I think, creates a presence and a field that's very attractive to all kinds of things.

[01:18:08.000] - Speaker 2
How do people continue to practice after the seven days?

[01:18:12.580] - Speaker 1
We have advanced follow-ups, and those are four-day events. And that is the difference between people who have only skied down the mountain a few times compared to people who ski every day. There's going to be an individual theme of that event. And it could be like we're doing the the mystical, how to make your own endogenous DMT and all that stuff. We're doing the programming for that now. So we'll do a four-day event where you're just immersed in the mystical, or we'll do one that's just abundance or one that's just healing. We'll create themes.

[01:18:47.420] - Speaker 2
You recommend daily practice for-Yeah.

[01:18:49.860] - Speaker 1
The second thing is what I'm the most proud of in our community really is people in our community do the work, and they don't do it because they have to. They They do it because they have so many wonderful things happening in their life. They don't want the magic to end. So there's a natural propensity for people to do the work every single day. But our strongest asset, my greatest value, is our community. And so there are authorized, coherence healing groups all around the globe, hundreds and hundreds of people that heal. They heal every single day. They just have people register and they do the heal. There's no charge. They do their thing. They report the results. And there's a strong sense of community. And those Coherence healers have told me, I've had breakfast with numbers of them, and they've all said, I could have had the worst day in the world when I come to that Coherence Healing and it's no longer about me. I can change my state. It's been the greatest value. And so many of them have healed in healing others. We have great documentation on that. Then there's communities in Amsterdam, in Mexico City, in Sydney, Australia, in Hong Kong that meet once a week in San Diego.

[01:20:05.600] - Speaker 1
Hundreds of people come together. They'll listen to something, and then they'll all do a meditation together. And then we're working on ways for them with apps and stuff to dial in with each other. As I said, I think the future is community. I think that's what's going to sustain us. Great.

[01:20:23.200] - Speaker 2
When you do a seven-day event, typically, how many of the people have come before and how many are new?

[01:20:30.540] - Speaker 1
On the average, it's about 75% new people. Amazing. We don't tell them anything. You have no schedule, there's no itinerary. You were starting at 6: 00 in the morning, and we're going to go to 7: 00 or 8: 00 at night. It's not all meditation. It's the information that you get when you combine quantum physics and neuroscience and neuroendocrineology and psychoimmunology and epigenetics and electromagneticism and Newtonian physics. You got to build a model. You got to fire and wire and get that the information in the stall hardware in preparation for the experience. Understand what you're doing. Understand why you're doing it. We give the information, we teach the information. But then you have to turn to the person next to you and teach that information back to them. Because if you can't teach it back to them, it's not wired in your brain. We know that now doing enough of these that you got to wire it in your brain. So get it wired in your brain. Then now that it's wired and you understand the what and why, let's get your behaviors to match your intentions. Let's practice. You practice, you have the experience, then there's We've all the experience a little bit more, and we've all the experience a little bit more.

[01:21:33.840] - Speaker 1
The beauty behind what we discovered is that the novice meditators, people who really haven't meditated much before or did a little meditation or a different meditation, at the end of seven days, when we look at their blood, you saw the documentary, the metabolites, the number of genes that are upregulated in novice meditators, at the end of seven days, their blood looks like their advanced meditators. They're regulating thousands of new proteins. And all these different chemicals, and they're in a ballroom. There's nothing really spectacular happening in a ballroom. It looks like a big sound booth, right? So the changes are coming from within them. The molecules that they're making are coming from within them. So the A seven-day event, 75% of the audience, sometimes 80% are first-timers. Then that 20%, the seven days always continue to evolve, so they're never the same. They're similar, but we're always adding new stuff.

[01:22:28.560] - Speaker 2
If it's a great experience, you might You're going to have it again.

[01:22:30.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you're just hitting the golf ball. You got to keep practicing, right?

[01:22:34.300] - Speaker 2
You use the word space often in the meditations. Is space empty?

[01:22:40.520] - Speaker 1
Well, if you look at Oxford quantum physicists, people who study quantum mechanics, they'll tell you it's not. You could take a box of empty space and remove everything material down to the atom, just a void. There are enormous amount of quantum fluctuations, frequencies that take place in that void or vacuum. And what does frequency contain? Information. Information about what? The hole. The hole is in there. So space is rich in frequency and energies. What we're looking Just like a hologram. Yes, exactly. What we're perceiving in terms of reality is the wavelength, the frequency of light, visible light. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, to go violet. That's rainbow spectrum. That's all we're perceiving in terms of all the frequencies that exist that are available. That frequency of light is bouncing off the most stable form of energy called matter, and it's fooling us into this illusion of separation. I'm here and you're there. And so in three-dimensional reality, everything is separate from us as a consciousness or an awareness. That quantum field, though, that invisible field of information that exists beyond space and time, there's nothing physical or material there, but it's the frequencies that we're not perceiving with our senses that are not material because everything material exists in three-dimensional reality, and that's not quantum.

[01:24:12.480] - Speaker 1
It's the effect of quantum. It's the slowest frequency. There are other frequencies, and the quantum is really those other frequencies that void or that vacuum is rich in energy. If you get right down to some theoretical physicists, they'll say it is pure consciousness, and in it lies all potentials in a non-manifest, immaterial, non-tangible form. In order for matter to appear, a vibratory sensation must be set into motion in the void or the vacuum. That's a thought, right? It's the realm of thought. It's the realm of information. It's the realm of possibilities.

[01:24:46.160] - Speaker 2
Everything comes from that.

[01:24:47.880] - Speaker 1
Everything material. All the matter. Everything physical and material comes from it. And think about it. Just take away everything physical and material in our known universe. You, me, bodies, people, objects, things, places, the world, moon, the sun, the planets, the moons on the planets, the stars, the galaxies. You're left with a void, a vacuum. But yet everything's suspended. There's laws of the way it all works in cycles.

[01:25:13.140] - Speaker 2
How does your work compare to faith healing?

[01:25:17.360] - Speaker 1
I don't know a ton about faith healing. What I make my greatest attempt in doing is offering people my greatest understanding of the truth and then numerous opportunities to it. If I could give them the information beforehand that helps them to accept what's possible and use science as the model, because I think that's the language that we have to use. And nothing has left the conjecture or superstition or dogma. They know exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it. The how becomes really meaningful. When you assign meaning to the act, you switch on the prefrontal cortex and it wants an outcome. It wants an outcome. It wants a result. If it's conjectures, if it's superstitious, if it's dogmatic, if it's spiritual, there tends to be a little doubt. So you got to remove the doubt so that intention is the primary objective. So my definition of faith is believing in thought more than anything else. That's when you truly have faith, right? But I don't know enough about faith healing in terms of I don't want people to hope and to wish and to want to wait, right? I want them to really understand that you can shorten the distance between the thought of what you want and the experience of having it.

[01:26:40.340] - Speaker 2
It's a practical action.

[01:26:41.780] - Speaker 1
Yes. When you lose the luster and you go back to hoping and wishing, it's only because you don't understand what you're doing and why you're doing it. You have to go back and relearn it. Okay, if I'm going to really heal my body, I better understand epigenetics. If I feel this emotion and I can sustain this emotion, I'm knocking on the genetic door, I can I can downregulate the gene for this disease and downregulate. I saw the data. I can downregulate the gene for this disease. I'm going to feel this emotion to have the intention of doing that. When we measure that? 100% of the people, when they're in the right state of mind and body, can actually intentionally They're going to intentionally signal a gene that they can't even pronounce. That's making a protein they can't even pronounce.

[01:27:21.270] - Speaker 2
It's just an intuitive knowing of how to do it.

[01:27:23.380] - Speaker 1
The intention is the information and the innate intelligence of the autonomic nervous system, the chemical brain will take that intention in the form of information and manufacture a pharmacy of chemicals equal to that intention. The first study we did, 100% of the people signaled the gene when they were in the right state. 95% regulated the gene when they were in the right state. That's how powerful we are.

[01:27:49.560] - Speaker 2
They don't have to know what it is or what it does.

[01:27:51.600] - Speaker 1
Intellectually, they don't have to know that it's 908 amino acids. They don't have to know the sequence. They don't have to know the length of the protein. Just have the intent. That's your and get in the right state, open the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Drop the information into that autonomic system. It knows what to do. That's exactly what we've discovered.

[01:28:11.180] - Speaker 2
You said that science is the contemporary language of mysticism. It's a beautiful phrase.

[01:28:17.400] - Speaker 1
I've been at this a little bit of time here, and I've noticed that the moment you mention a word that is in some tradition or some spiritual sect or some culture, I think people shut off. I've been at religious conferences. I was invited to the parliament to the world religion. I've been to the Vatican, and I've seen people argue words. But they're 5,000 years old or 2,000. Nobody knows what they mean.

[01:28:45.380] - Speaker 2
It doesn't matter.

[01:28:46.140] - Speaker 1
It doesn't matter. It's just a label. Let's rename them. Everything that we do in the brain and body to rename everything that could be interpreted as something traditional. I think that science tends to unify community. It is the language. If you understand quantum physics and you understand neuroscience, and you understand epigenetics, the language specialists that come and study our work, they say independent of your native language, at the end of seven days, you're all speaking the same language.

[01:29:15.220] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the power of words. How specifically do you choose the words for the meditations?

[01:29:22.540] - Speaker 1
We do a lot of real-time brain scans. We're going to have an event next week, and we're going to use a 128 leads on the brain, which is all over. In the real-time scans, I never really give it the attention that I do now, how important sound and word is. Our events, even though they're for large numbers of people are like a big sound booth. There's pipe and drape around the whole entire thing. There's no point in the room where the music drops. It is a very tight system. I want to create an environment where people can forget about the person next to them, can forget about where they're sitting, can forget about their cell phone, can forget about their life, and they can get immersed inwardly. And so we started looking in those real-time scans at the music, like what music can alter a brain state. And we found that when music that tends to be somewhat mathematical, where there's rhythms and within rhythms and harmonics within harmonics that are playing out in certain ways. And I could ride those rhythms, and I can say infinite, and there'll be a pause, and there's a rhythm, and I can say vast, and there's a pause, and there's a rhythm, and I can say space, and there's a pause, and there's a rhythm, and sense it, right?

[01:30:54.500] - Speaker 1
That rhythm over time starts entraining the brain to order. I'll give away a little secret now. As the week goes on, when people are getting conditioned, based on those scans, if I say infinite, pause, vast, pause, and I don't say space, and I wait two rhythms, their brain will start to change in anticipation of me saying it. So they're changing their brain on their own.

[01:31:22.710] - Speaker 2
That's interesting.

[01:31:23.660] - Speaker 1
And the music in time by itself, the moment they hear it, now we know, starts to entrain the brain to get more orderly. Then when we were looking at it, I'd sit down one group of scientists were at breakfast and they said, You know when you said that word, the 10 people that we were scanning, they all went into Gamma. Then we started looking at the words. Now I know certain words that make a very important change in the brain.

[01:31:55.340] - Speaker 2
Negative or positive.

[01:31:56.830] - Speaker 1
Exactly. But most of them are very not looking for negative. There's enough of that. So the word was the next thing. And then the way I say it has become another specific element. And so my voice tends to be different than the voice I'm using right now because I don't want people to be thinking about me. I want them in time to forget about there's just a voice coming from the void. And then there's just effects. If I can get that just right amount of reverb, that my voice is inside the music, then the person has a very personal experience, and I'm just window dressings part of the whole entire thing, and I'm calling them in some way. So we do our best. I talk to the language specialists all the time because I want to get really clear that I can correlate in a very seductive and objective way a brain state that could be achieved over and over again. We now know that we can reach certain brain states. When a person reaches a certain brain state, now I can say to a new neuroscientist that's watching, this person's going to go off in about five minutes or less and it's going to be big.

[01:33:11.320] - Speaker 1
They're like, What do you mean? Their whole entire brain is going to change in five minutes. We can induce it, we can predict it, and now we can replicate it. That's science, right? So it's producing a state of trance. In trans, you have to slow your brain waves down. The only way you slow your brainwaves down is you suppress your analytical mind. When you suppress your analytical mind, you open the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Now you're more suggestible to information. And suggestibility is your ability to accept that information, to believe in that information, to surrender to that information as if it's the truth without analyzing it at all. That's exactly what begins the program. You're going to write a new track, right? Rehearse a new way. That's what actually changes us subconsciously.

[01:34:02.280] - Speaker 2
How is guided meditation different from other self-directed meditation, like mantra or breathing, body awareness?

[01:34:10.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah. The majority of the meditations that we do in our work are guided to some degree. I want to get people to a certain point. When they get to that point, I toss them into the unknown, and they can have their experience or they can create. They have their moment do that. Me personally, I don't listen to my own voice. I don't know if I could tolerate it, but I do a lot of self-directed meditation. I think it's just like anything else. If you're dancing the salsa and you got to go count the steps in your head to get it down, count the steps until it becomes one move. As it becomes one move, you're less reliant on the process. A lot of our advanced meditators, the advanced meditations are longer periods where a person can be self-directed. We don't see many brain changes from what we've looked at when it comes to mantras or to affirmations. I think that many people who move into those right states of mind and body, they have the ability to begin to change their brain waves on their own. And that's what we want people to be able to do.

[01:35:21.880] - Speaker 1
We don't spend a lot of time studying mantras. We do at least six or seven different types of breaths, and each one of those breaths are designed for something different.

[01:35:33.060] - Speaker 2
How do breath meditations work?

[01:35:36.000] - Speaker 1
They're not breath meditations per se. Let me give you an example. So most of our meditations that we start, we start with our hearts. The act of creation should be a reverent, loving thing. Let's get our hearts open, like the creative center, the union of polarity, the union of opposites, where wholeness starts. Let's get our creative center awakened and move out of survival. So the beginning of the event, you can imagine everybody's coming, they're jet lag, they're on the wrong time zone, they lost their luggage, whatever. First two days, you got to work that out. As the event goes on, the breathing becomes very instrumental because they're able to drop in a lot faster. So the breathing that takes place with the heart is different than when we do the breathing to begin to bring enormous amounts of energy that's stored in the body back into the brain. Why? Because I want a person to be able to have enough energy in their brain so they don't fall asleep when they do their meditation where they're relaxed and awake, and you got to work for that. That's a very active breath. You're squeezing cerebral spinal fluid up into the brain and you're starting to...

[01:36:38.040] - Speaker 1
The sympathetic nervous system switches on and merges with the parasympathetic nervous system. There goes all the guilt. There goes all the pain that's turning back into pure energy. So that breath is a very active breath, right? When people lay down after meditations, and I don't want them to fall asleep yet, we'll do a different type of breath. And that different type of breath is to to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide so that when you lay down and you're doing that breath, you feel so euphoric that you don't quite want to go to sleep yet and you linger in that world between half awake and half asleep. That's where the door is. That's where magic land is. That's where information exists. Those are three examples. And then we evolved the breath in other ways, but all to change your state in some way. So the brain studies and the heart studies that we look at show that there are effects that we're looking for actually take place. So we show the people the scans, we show them the breath, and then do the breath, and this is the outcome you'll get. If you don't do it, it won't happen.

[01:37:44.130] - Speaker 1
And if you go half in, it won't happen. If you say, I'm too tired or too old or too out of shape or whatever, it's not going to happen. You got to go all in. Again, getting everybody doing something at the same time, behaving in the same way, creates that emerging consciousness. So breaths do tend to produce strong physiological changes. That's what we see.

[01:38:05.840] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the meditation-hybernation relationship.

[01:38:10.500] - Speaker 1
One of the things we're working with Stanford University, working with a researcher there that has a sophisticated machine that measures breath. First of all, we measure everything you could possibly imagine I've measured. Breast milk, I mean, everything, microbiome, everything. Tears. There's information in breath. When we did our first analysis with the university there, there were some key factors in the breath that suggests that a person moves into a hibernating state. In hibernation, there's some great physiological things that happen that I find really profound. There's a decrease in sex drive. That first energy center just shuts off. Goes to sleep. Goes to sleep. There's a decrease in appetite. Second energy center where you metabolize, turns off, goes into stasis. There's a loss in the preoccupation with the external environment. Third energy center, get up and do something, shuts down. So the animal self goes into stasis. That's That's what allows the caterpillar to become butterfly. That's what allows the octopus to grow a new limb. It's the state of stasis where you could actually forget about that body and wake up in another body. And so we see these early signs of these particular molecules in the breath that indicate that hibernation is taking place.

[01:39:35.120] - Speaker 1
And along with that in the breath, the body goes into ketosis, which is a more elegant, more efficient way to burn energy. And then there's another molecule in the breath that elevates, that determines a lengthening of age, like a longevity is enhanced. The second interesting thing has to do with melatonin. Our eyes are our sensors that pick up light. The frequency or wavelength of light is passing through your iris and it's hitting the retina, and there the optic nerve is translating that information from light into a nucleus in the brain and pineal gland makes serotonin. When there's an inhibition of light, There's an absence of light. Everybody knows this. The pineal gland switches and begins to make melatonin. Serotonin gets you up, melatonin puts you asleep. When restores the body, one requires the body to use energy. When you begin to awake in this dormant, latent system in the brain, we saw the documentary, and the pineal gland is like the brain's radio antenna. Vertebrates have them. A chameleon is picking up information from its environment, not through its senses, but through that soft part of their skull. Infrared, invisible light is penetrating that area, and it's releasing pigments that are derivatives of melatonin that camouflage the organism to survive in the environment.

[01:40:58.480] - Speaker 1
So we have a pineal gland. There's a principle in biology called endowment. You don't use it, you lose it, and it's been there forever in human beings. And why is it there? And it does more than just convert serotonin to melatonin. Why is it there? It has tiny little It has no crystals in it, calcium crystals that act as a transducer. And a transducer is like a TV antenna picking up information in the form of frequency and translating it as chemistry. In our biology. Those crystals are latent. And the breath that we do to bring energy into the brain, there's articles that talk about, scientific research that talks about the pineo gland having a piezoelectric effect. Those crystals, when you apply a mechanical stress to those crystals, they become polarized like a magnet. The mechanical stress begins to create electrical charge. Now the crystals become electrically activated, and they actually begin to shimmer. Dial down the Neil cortex, dial down the thinking brain that plugs you into three-dimensional reality. Take all your attention off the material, put it on the in-material, change your brain waves, shut off the mechanism that plugs you into three-dimensional reality.

[01:42:14.700] - Speaker 1
Get in a state where you're suggestible to information, get your brain coherent, start connecting to energy and information, the pineal gland begins to make that connection. It can transduce the information, right? So once the pineal gland picking up frequency that's not visible light, the core, melatonin, can no longer be melatonin. And it can't be serotonin either, because serotonin is a function of the frequency of light that we're getting through our senses. But the pineal gland is picking up frequency that's not light. It's a frequency that's faster than light. What's that? Quantum. And the information that's being carried on that frequency is the unknown. It's not information that you're going to get from your sense. It's information you're getting from Remember, there's more information in the immaterial than there is in the material. So the brain begins to connect and melatonin begins to make these derivatives. And the derivatives look a lot like serotonin and melatonin Melatonin is already an antioxidant. Now, melatonin is going to get an upgrade. It's going to be a more rich, more whole, more profound antioxidant. These are the most powerful antioxidants known to man. A derivative of melatonin. Why? Because it's interactional.

[01:43:30.000] - Speaker 1
Interacting with greater information. Melatonin already causes you to relax. Now, you're going to produce a benzodiazapine-like molecule. You're going to chill out, like suppress the survival centers in the amygdala. That's what Valium does. It's Valium. And it then begins to produce a molecule that's elevated in hibernating animals. And that's where the body can move into that state of stasis, the same chemical that's found in electric eels. What electric eels do, they amplify charges in their nervous That's why we see these high gamma patterns in the brain when a person connects. I mean, really connects. The orderly gamma that's created in their brain when they have that connection is very, very high. And there's an amplification in the nervous system. Then take melatonin and tweak it again, and you got dimethyl triptamine and dimethyl 5-methoxy triptamine-DMT. Buckle up, because now that's the exact molecule that you need to see beyond the veil. The The derivatives that are created chemically in the limbic brain when a tuning fork is tuned up to energy and information begins to put the body in a state where you literally can forget about that body and wake up in another body.

[01:44:44.940] - Speaker 1
That's when you have that transidental experience where you travel through time and you experience other dimensions, other realities, and you don't need an exogenous substance to do that.

[01:44:55.380] - Speaker 2
Is that where intuition comes from as well?

[01:44:58.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think when this happens, this is a download of content. But in your waking day, when you're in trans, you're driving in your car and you're suppressing your analytical mind, you get impulses, you get information. When your limbic brain is tuned up, That's the the psychic brain. That's where you're getting information. People can develop that skill. You can practice it and trust the information you're getting.

[01:45:24.760] - Speaker 2
Does the body always want to heal, and is the only reason it doesn't heal, the mind?

[01:45:31.820] - Speaker 1
I think the body genuinely wants to be joyful. I think the body wants to be happy. I'll give you a little side note about this. We were looking at 63 different diseases in one study, and we looked at the self-reported surveys. Just about every single person at the end of the seven-day event, independent of the disease they had, every single one of them said that they noticed a decrease in their body's physical pain. They had less pain independent, whether it was cancer or spinal cord injury or whatever. And they had more energy. There was less fatigue and they had more energy. So of course, the next question is, Is it possible that they're manufacturing their own endogenous morphine? Are they making their own pharmacy of morphine? I thought alone. And when we did the study, we found out 100% of the people that we measured who are making their own endogenous opioids, encephalins, and endorphins, and dinorphins, which really produce a state of euphoria. Opioids produce a euphoria that goes along with this suppression and pain. And that creates a level of joy, like a level of euphoria where, again, it supports our model of relaxed and awake.

[01:46:57.080] - Speaker 1
You're out of survival. So I think that's the state of being. When we're not in stress-State of well-being?

[01:47:03.260] - Speaker 2
What do you call it?

[01:47:03.800] - Speaker 1
A state of well-being. Exactly. Wellness. You're not preoccupied with the future or the past. You're not going to the worst-case scenario. 100% of the people are making their own endogenous opules, they look like they were taking morphine. Where are those chemicals coming from? They're coming from within us. When the body moves out of dysregulation and it moves back to order and regulation, we can enter the circle in so many ways. The person who's opening their heart and they're starting to feel love and gratitude and joy. If they're feeling those feelings, they're making different chemicals. If they were feeling different feelings, they would make different chemicals. And these feelings begin to make chemicals like oxytocin. Our studies show that people make an enormous amount of oxytocin. And the side effect of body feeling more whole, more loving, more joyful, more present, more relaxed, the side effect of that is the person's healing. And many people say, God, I felt so great, I could care less. I really could care less if I had my disease. I was so happy with myself. I was so grateful for life. They were no longer identifying with their disease. There's no longer their identity.

[01:48:23.980] - Speaker 1
And that's when they healed, right? So we talk about this a lot with the scientific team because because the antithesis of that is desperation. When you're desperate, you're in severe lack. You're waiting for it to change. The takeaway this feeling of lack or separation. No new information can enter the nervous system that is not equal to the emotional state the person's in. So all of life uses information to organize itself into form. Without information, life can't give birth to anything new. So the person who's open to information then in a state of joy, the body, is in that state of receiver-ship. But they're at a point where they're no longer desperate. They're feeling like something's changing within them, and They'll say, I no longer focused on my healing. I noticed that the more love that I felt, the more better my body felt. And I'm going to keep doing this to produce that. And no person in my life is going to stop me from doing this. And I'm going to do it all the time because I know somehow it's making me feel better. Now it's no longer like a have to. It's no longer like a technique.

[01:49:39.020] - Speaker 1
It's an act. You understand this is working. I'm going to keep doing this to produce that effect. Our interest is understanding what emotional state the body is in. The chemistry that's created when they're in that emotional state is either weakening the body or actually strengthening the body. The emotional conditioning of the body is one of the hardest things for a person to overcome because it's like riding an unbridled horse, and you got to get on it, and you got to be willing to get tossed, and you say, I'm giving up. You got to get back on it, and you're training the animal over and over again, the animal self. And sooner or later, when it realizes it's no longer the mind, where you're executing a will that's greater than the program that caused the person to lose their free will, it's David versus Goliath. In the beginning, you're facing off with something that appears much larger than you. And yet we now know, based on what we're doing, that it used to take four days for that to happen, but there are enough footprints in consciousness that it's taking place in two days. The group breaks through in two days, and now there's that emergent consciousness.

[01:50:56.040] - Speaker 1
There's a flux of energy where healings can occur. People can create. The mystical is right there. Miracles will happen, and you are exposed to that. It's unbelievable. Yet, the most important thing that people walk away with from the whole entire thing, and I listen to them all the time, I feel differently. I feel like a different person. I feel differently.

[01:51:21.000] - Speaker 2
Regardless of what the testing shows, when you're in the room and it's after two days and people are changing, can you feel it in the room? Yeah. Energetically.

[01:51:33.330] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. A hundred % of the people in the room just go, I cannot believe what I'm feeling. It is palpable. And I walked backstage with one of my staff at the end of the 10-day event because that was a new level for us. We went 10 days. And I said to her, I said, Can you imagine? Look at all of the light in these people's faces. We now know because we do facial recognition, We do voice analysis by using your cell phone. At the end of seven days, your face looks different. At the end of seven days, your voice has way more harmonicity. Of course, if your nervous system is coherent, your voice is going to be more harmonious. We see these profound changes that are taking place in people to suggest that they're no longer the same person. They're literally somebody else.

[01:52:28.020] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the blue light Okay, so I'm not a whales in space guy.

[01:52:33.220] - Speaker 1
I'm pretty much a pragmatist. Yeah. Many times when people have a healing, they tend to report that there's a blue frequency, a blue light.

[01:52:44.180] - Speaker 2
Their eyes are closed.

[01:52:45.200] - Speaker 1
Their eyes are closed. Sometimes it's represented as a beautiful fractal pattern, it's like a kaleidoscope. Fractal is standing wave of information. It's resonance. It's waves on waves. Or it's an etheoric light. The emotion that's associated with that light tends to be an enormous amount of love. Many people who have their experience with this blue light tend to have a profound healing that takes place almost instantaneously, and because they're feeling that tremendous amount of love. I guess that's a frequency that's carrying certain information.

[01:53:25.100] - Speaker 2
Is stress the main issue that holds us I think that when we're living in stress, we're in an altered state.

[01:53:36.320] - Speaker 1
Stress is when our brains and body-So stress is the altered state? Yes. People will tell you, the emotions, let's look at the emotions of a stress response. When we're living in survival, there's aggression. And aggression can be translated as anger. It could be translated as hatred. It could be translated as control. It could be translated as competition, fear, anxiety, worry, guilt, shame, suffering, pain, unworthiness. It's what psychology calls these normal human states of consciousness. Stress is when we're knocked out of homeostasis, we're not ourselves. We're out of balance. Now, all organisms can tolerate short term stress. You get chased by a predator, you outrun the predator. The stress response is signaled. You mobilize enormous amounts of energy, you outrun the predator. The body goes back into homeostasis and balance. For human beings, it's a little different. We can turn on the stress response just by thought alone. You think about that worst case scenario, and you're producing the same chemicals as if the event is occurring, which means then you're knocking your brain and body out of balance just by thinking about your problem. You're moving out of homeostasis just by obsessing about the problems in your life.

[01:54:50.380] - Speaker 1
Now, no organism in nature can live in a state of survival and stress for an extended period of time because you're mobilizing an enormous amount of energy for some threat in your outer environment. There's no energy in your inner environment for growth and repair. There's no energy for long-term building projects. If there's a war and you're mobilizing all the troops, there's no homeland security, your immune system is going to become compromised. You're going to downregulate proteins in your immune system. It's a scientific fact that the long term effects of the hormones of stress push the genetic buttons and create disease. If you can turn on the stress response just by thought alone, it means your thoughts can make you sick. If your thoughts can make you sick, is it possible that your thoughts can make you well? And the answer is absolutely. We've proven that over and over again. Now, that's not how we've been programmed to think or what we are told to believe. Because we just ask people to give up resentment in patience and judgment, and feel gratitude, appreciation, love, and kindness, and their immune system is strengthened by 50% in four days.

[01:55:55.980] - Speaker 1
They're making proteins that are the most powerful flu shots you could ever take, immunoglobulins that are robust, where the army is coming back, right? So 75 to 90%, some studies say 60 to 80%, but the majority of people that walk into a doctor's office or a health care provider's office in the Western world. It's walking in because of psychological and emotional stress. Now, let's break it down. You have three types of stress, physical, chemical, and emotional. Physical stress, trauma, injury, accident, fall. Chemical stress, pesticides, pollutants, viruses, bacteria, fungus, blood sugar levels, hangovers, whatever. Emotional stress, family tragedies, second mortages, single parenting, Job loss, family member death, whatever. If there's three types of stress, then there's three types of balance, physical, chemical, and emotional. Okay, let's reason this. A person does hit training, does yoga, has massage, acupuncture, gets chiropractic, does everything to get their body physically in balance. They take their vitamins, they take their minerals, they take their peptides, they're eating a low stress diet, they're gluten free, they're ketogenic, they're organic, and yet they're stressed out, they're controlling, they're rigid, they're impatient, and they're suffering. It doesn't take a scientist to figure out that they can do all of that stuff.

[01:57:25.220] - Speaker 1
If they're not staying emotionally balanced, none of that is producing effects. Because why? It's not a time to absorb. Your body is secreting chemicals to move energy into your tissues, and you're not running, you're not fighting, you're not hiding. Blood flow is going to the hindbrain and away from the forebrain just by being emotionally upset. Your immune system is dialing down. Digestive juices are shutting off. It's not a time to digest. Your reproductive system shuts down. I mean, your heart is beating against the closed system because you're not running, fighting, and hiding, and it's moving out of order.

[01:58:01.040] - Speaker 2
You give the example in the movie of getting stressed out on a Zoom call, and there's no way to physically react to the information. It's an unnatural state.

[01:58:12.780] - Speaker 1
Exactly. So the point is that if you do those things and you don't take care of the emotional component, it just tends to be that those chemicals are very arousing. They're very arousing, and people become addicted to those chemicals. If you can turn on that stress response by thought alone, they become addicted to their own thoughts. If they use their coworker to feel hatred, and they use their ex to feel resentment, then they become addicted to the life, the people in their life that they don't even like. They become addicted to the life they don't like. And that's why it's hard for people to change because you're going to go through those withdrawals and you just had a bad trip, and there's going to be cravings. Just feel angry today. Come on. Get back into the known. And so that's why affirmations, I feel like, and thinking positively produce very little effects if you're feeling negatively. You could say, I'm healthy, I'm healthy, I'm wealthy, I'm wealthy. It's not enough. You got to change that state, right? And so we have this emergent group of physicians now in our community that have healed themselves and have seen profound healings, have studied the data, their health care providers.

[01:59:25.410] - Speaker 1
Now we have a way to offer this to them to be able to bring it into their practices to speak a different language to their patients. We just did our first event in San Diego. It was super successful because the truth is, you have to tell the person. If pharmaceuticals to get you chemically balanced, so be it. But it's not going to heal your depression. You're going to heal your depression. It's not going to heal your anxiety. You're going to heal your anxiety because you got to do the work to get your body back into autonomic regulation, creating brain coherence and creating heart coherence and synchronizing your brain to your heart. Three There are very great ways to do that. And that will help you to heal because it will help you move back in the balance. And now you have the patient informed enough to go, I'm in. Because if the moment you feel the emotion from your past, your body is going to believe it's in the past, and you're going to behave as if you're in the past. How many times do we have to forget until we stop forgetting and start remembering?

[02:00:23.860] - Speaker 1
That's the moment of change. Now the practitioner is involving the person because chronic The autonomic health conditions, which is 95% of health conditions, require a lifestyle change. Nobody's talking about change. They may know what they want to change or why they want to change, but they just don't know how to change. So give the patient the tool to be able to understand that they can create autonomic regulation by regulating their emotional state and to shorten the refractory period of their emotional responses, and to know the difference between when they're there and when they're not, so they can participate in their own change. Beautiful.

[02:01:03.740] - Speaker 2
Is the brain a prediction machine like AI?

[02:01:07.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's an anticipation machine. In fact, that's what our data shows. On our functional MRI studies, there's a part of the brain called the default mode network. It's just a cluster of different networks that produce a level of mind that's always trying to lay down and predict the next moment. Like, what are you going to do after this? And then where are we going to go after that? And what are we going to do after that? And then when we're going to eat dinner? And then the brain's always lining that up because it could feel safe. It got to feel safe in your environment. And yet that becomes habituated. And the default mode system is our brain's predictor. And then when the reality occurs, if the prediction isn't correct, it just corrects the prediction. That's how the brain works. What we discovered in our fMRI studies is that default mode network shuts off. In other words, if you're not predicting the future, you're in the present moment. And if you're in present moment, we discovered, if you're not expecting anything to happen, that's the moment the unexpected happens. So if the default mode network shuts off and you're in the present moment, you're more prone to be creative.

[02:02:13.980] - Speaker 1
Now, what we discovered is that that network in advanced meditators, after their meditation, after the week long, after one meditation, that brain's predictor stays shut off. Now, the degree of that change in the default mode, networking the brain, is so severe in our advanced meditators that it looks like the brain is on psilocybin. It looks like they're having a profound transidental experience. And there's a correlation between brain coherence from our fMRIs in a mystical and transcendental moment. The brain's got to be able to tune in to information. It's like a tuning for us. It's got to be resonant. It's got to be orderly. And those compartments of the brain that we talked about earlier that are subdivided, the brain is switching its attention. The networks are activated and they're all compartmentalized, they're modulated. That there's a greater amount of connectivity that takes place in the brain that facilitates a greater understanding or processing of information. The micro clusters that have been separated form macro clusters. When they form macro clusters, they're exchanging a greater level of information, which means the brain is processing a greater level of consciousness. Then between 4 and 7% of our brain we're typically using at one time, you're feeling your back against the chair, you're listening to what I'm saying, you're looking at me, the visual cortex, you're paying attention, frontal lobe, association center, small, lights are going off.

[02:03:45.480] - Speaker 1
When the brain is highly resonant like this, we're looking at 25, 26% of the brain online. The person is connected, right? It's a huge connection. So the brain's predictor in that moment is completely shut off. Now you're in an objective state for you to no longer try to predict the future based on the past. And there's an area in the brain that actually enlarges, not just grows new connections, but grows new neurons, the volume of that part of the brain that helps the body orient itself in space. In other words, it's bigger because you're telling the body it's no longer the mind. You're telling the body you're going to sit. That muscle has got to be really strong. The more you use it, the greater mind you have there. So that area of the brain is substantially larger because the person is using that brain to get beyond their body. And so when we look at the plasma of these people, They have proteins and information in the plasma of their blood that's creating neurogenesis, like a flourishing of neurons. They're not taking any neural growth factor, and yet there's flourishing that's taking place in the brain because of this state of growth, the state of nurturing, the state of repair that's taking place.

[02:05:09.880] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the PEAR study.

[02:05:11.860] - Speaker 1
Yes. If you look at some of the research from UC Berkeley years ago. One of the studies that they did is they took a young mouse and an old mouse, a rodent, and they combined their circulatory systems. They put them together. And what happened in time was the information that was in the plasma in the blood of the young mouse caused the old mouse to get younger. And there were some little changes that took place in the young mouse, getting a little older, but for the most part, the old mouse got a lot younger. It changed in a lot of morphogenic ways. So of course, we can't do that study at our event, but we were really curious to see what information does. So we took a young person in their 20s or late teens, because we have a huge youth community. We have about 100 kids under the age of 25 that come to our events, which is super cool. And we paired them with people that were 30 years older. And the idea was that they were to eat together, sit next to each other, exchange and teach back the information together, meditate together, brief at the end of the day together.

[02:06:18.940] - Speaker 1
And in the morning at 5: 00 AM, they would have to do these cognitive tests to determine cognition. And of course, as you would imagine, the old person said, There's no way I'm going to hang with this I want another young, finally, other young person. And the young kid said, There's no way I'm going to make it with this person. And for the most part, they became best friends at the end of seven days. But we compared them to people that went through the seven-day event, both young and old. Now, there are dramatic brain changes that take place. 100% of the people, according to the neuroscientists, have brain changes that come to the event. There's some change for the positive. We were comparing the pair group to people that already can produce brain changes. What we discovered at the end of the seven-day event was that the brains of the young and the elders had tremendous amounts of gamma activity in their frontal lobe and their forebrain. They switched on, the executive center, the boss of the brain, the creative center turned on. And at the same time, the rest of the brain was in a beautiful state of alpha, both in the young and the old, way more than any of the controls that just went through the seven-day event.

[02:07:32.860] - Speaker 1
What was the most revealing was their cognitive studies. We expected that the elders would score better in their studies, but what we discovered that the elders scored better and the youth also scored better, which means the plasticity of the youth was given to the elder and the wisdom of the elder was given to the youth. There's so much to say about who you hang out with, what you talk about when you hang out, and this idea of family, where the elder, the matriarch was with the grandchild, and it's so important for them to get together and to interact. So we're going to reproduce that study again next week. That sounds great.

[02:08:16.820] - Speaker 2
How has this work changed your life?

[02:08:21.080] - Speaker 1
People say to me, Why do you keep doing this? It's because I can't believe what we're discovering. I consider myself a pretty open-minded person, and I was trained in science and in health. When you see a person with muscular dystrophy, you look that up on the internet, it'll tell you there is no cure. It comes in a wheelchair and walks out. I can't tell you. I watched that testimonial so many times in that young guy, you can listen to him talk, and he's in this altered state. He has no doubt he's just been lit up by energy. We had a woman on the stage that lost nine centimeters of her colon, surgically removed from cancer, and grew 10 centimeters back.

[02:09:06.300] - Speaker 2
Which isn't scientifically possible based on what we believe.

[02:09:12.240] - Speaker 1
We've been conditioned into believing something else. But I saw the scan. I saw the tissue. It is opalescent, juvenile, very fresh, regenerated, brand new tissue. Brand new colon, it wasn't scar tissue. It was alive. It was a whole new tissue. I had to look at that scan. I had to listen to her testimonial. It's unbelievable. We're not programmed to believe that. What does that mean? There's that magic number one. It means the human body has the innate capacity to regenerate itself at any age if it's given the right information. Amazing. Now this woman, you lose your colon and your rectum, you lose your dignity. She couldn't travel more than 10 feet from the bathroom. Her whole life was on the toilet. She couldn't sleep. She was suicidal. The doctor told her, At your age, don't expect anything. And she watched a bunch of the testimonials. She saw someone that grew her thyroid back. She had no other choice. There was nothing else that was going to help her. All she needed was the one moment where she got through an entire meditation without having to stop and go to the bathroom. That's all she needed.

[02:10:23.840] - Speaker 1
That was it for her. The moment she got that, she knew I did something. Something's changing. Then she came to an event. She never left her house. She went through every meditation, sat through every lecture, never had to get up to use the toilet. What is going on? Now, she's going, Whatever this is, I'm going to keep doing it. You see a person with Parkinson's disease that lost cognition, lost his sense of smell, his sense of sight, paralyzed on one side of his body, severe tremors, severe pain. On the stage, he was in a previous study. He's a completely normal guy. He's completely normal. How has it changed me? It stretched my mind. I just can't believe it. We had a woman on the stage last week, a young woman with a bone cancer in her sacrum bones. Started out the size of a Lemon, rare type of bone cancer. No radiation, no chemo, no nothing more. They wanted to amputate, take out her sacrum and all the nerves. You can imagine all the functions she would lose. She's no No evidence of cancer in her sacrum. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Wild. It's wild. I never get tired of that because it speaks to that part of me that already knows that I talk myself out of the fact that we're greater than we think, more powerful than we know, more unlimited than we can ever dream.

[02:11:50.460] - Speaker 1
Next week, we're going to Denver, and we're doing seven scientific studies, and we're going to measure the breadth of the room. Why? Because when you go to a comedy show, you have a different breadth in the collective or different molecules in the room than when you go to a horror show. Let's look to see what the collective is doing. We're reproducing all kinds of studies just because I'm so excited because we've never been discouraged. We've never been like, Oh, okay. Now we're measuring height and weight and strength and gait. Everything. We have early evidence to suggest that you're taller at the end of a seven-day event, that you're stronger without a doubt. Your body fat diminishes, your gait changes in seven days. It's just insane. You come to seven days and you get to pretend to be whoever you want to be. It's like a monastery. You want to be healed? Walk in the glory of being healed during those walking meditations. You want to be healed? You got to get beyond your body in order to change your body. Give people the tools, give them the information, give them the evidence between the discoveries that we're uncovering in the scientific realm.

[02:12:58.960] - Speaker 1
You have to see the scientists. Well, you saw the document, they were really big doubters. And now they say, This is medicine. This is medicine. Combine that with the testimonials that are really unbelievable. The science is actually supporting the microbiome. Just look at our data in microbiome. At the end of seven days, we can look at a person's microbiome. At the beginning of seven days, we can predict they have cancer because you have so many data points. At the end of seven days, the algorithm can't predict they have cancer anymore. They look like a healthy person. And they're not They're not changing their diet. They're not ingesting anything. They're not changing anything. In seven days, we might be changing your microbiome. We got to take probiotics, stop drinking alcohol, no sugar, all that stuff. Matter to matter, it takes time and energy. They're a different person. They They'd be the same microbiome, they'd be the same person. So piecing this all together and then taking the information that we get from all the different branches of our studies and understanding, interpreting that information helps to teach transformation better. Measure that transformation again with rigor. Understand that information, and then you can teach transformation better, and you can begin to shortly-Refin it.

[02:14:12.330] - Speaker 1
Refine it. So the language gets more refined, that the process gets more refined, that the collective does it quicker, that there's more outcomes. Combine that with a stage testimonial or two, and you got a group of people that begin to believe in possibility again. And then when you believe in possibility, as I said, you believe in yourself. So people, when they move out of survival, they start to view a whole new landscape. They're seeing from a greater level of mind. And so now we're working with prisons. We've done thousands of changes in different prisons in Latin America and the United States. We're working with Navy Seals and Special Ops and PTSD, and these guys are having dramatic changes in their states. We're working with Indigenous tribes as well and changing culture there. We're working with children. And so it's flourished into this crazy thing where people are beginning to understand that they can change.
