[00:00:06.760] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. I think when I was maybe around 18 years old, that's when I was all of a sudden turning my visions the reality. I went to an international bodybuilding championship. It was 18 years old. I went to Stuttgart, and I won. It was like, Oh, my God. I won my first international, the Junior Mr. Europe, the junior best-built man of Europe. This is unbelievable. This is the first time an Austrian won an international competition like that. I said, myself, I feel like my dream and my vision that I had my bodybuilding career is becoming more and more reality. I felt like it really worked because I was chasing this vision. Then eventually, with the age of 20, after winning Mr. Europe when I was 19, and then another Mr. International competition. Then I went to the Mr. Universe contest with 19, and I played second. I saw the very platform and the very theater, the Dredge park that Steve Reeves, my idol, won Mr. Universe. I said to myself, I cannot believe that I'm actually standing at the same podium as my heroes and my idol were standing on. Then, true enough, that inspired me so much that I became run-up, second-place winner.

[00:01:48.910] - Speaker 1
With the age of 19, this has never, ever been heard of, something like that. I became the new sensation. The young farm boy from Austria, Oh, you should see his arms. He's going to be the next monster There's got to be the next champion in order. But sure enough, a year later, I come back with the age of 20, and that became the youngest Mr. Universe ever on that very same stage. That very vision that I had of Reggie Rock-winning Mr. Universe, but placing my head on it, that's the way I was visualized it. People screaming from the balcony, Arnold, Arnold, and all that stuff. All of that became an absolute reality, exactly the way I visualized it. So I I think that between 18 and 20, I realized this is amazing that my dream and my vision become a reality. It became natural to me to then do everything like that, to start really concentrating on what is my next move instead. I started getting a lot of thoughts, a lot of visions, and a lot of dreams, and I started acting them out.

[00:02:52.450] - Speaker 2
How much of bodybuilding was mental? We think of it as a physical thing, but tell me the mental game of bodybuilding.

[00:02:59.860] - Speaker 1
I would say everything is mental, even though in order to achieve the goal, it's physical. But first, you have to create a vision and a goal. That comes from your mind. I had a very clear vision of what I wanted to look like and what competition I wanted to win and all that stuff. Then you start working out, and then you realize it takes a lot of discipline, and it takes a lot of planning. You can have a vision of what your body should look like, but you still have to now figure out, how do you train to get there? How do you make this vision become a reality? That's what I needed to do, put a program together. Again, I learned some of the masters that were already Mr. Universe and Mr. Great Britain and Mr. America and all of those titles. And I studied their routines, and I started copying their routines. In some ways, of course, you have to create your own routine because every body is different. Every body type is different. So I just had to really understand this is what I it look like. It's sculpting. You have to have the same mentality and mind of an artist that is sculpting a sculpture, except you're doing it on your own body.

[00:04:12.610] - Speaker 1
Instead of using clay and chisels and all that, investing from the equipment to chisel and to board, you do it with machines and with exercises. I did create this body. It's totally meant that you have to have that vision all the time in front of You have to know exactly, okay, I need more weird deltoids. I need more lower back striations. I need more trapecius muscles. I need more striations in the pectoral muscle. There's specific exercises for each of those body parts that you have to know and then you have to do. Then you have to know what are the reps, what are the sets. You have to have a total understanding of the way the body is being created and what you need, not just to copy someone else, but what do you need, what does your body need since your body is different than maybe your idol's body. I think a lot of that is mental. I think that this is mental. That understanding that you need training partners that motivate you is mental. You have to keep your continuous motivation. There's the long-term motivation, which is your long-term goal, your vision. But then there's short-term goals where you have to say, Okay, I'm in five months from now, I want to go.

[00:05:26.820] - Speaker 1
It comes to the true lie, and I have made the national power lift. I have to bench press in the 300 pounds, and I have to go and have my arms develop to 20 inches by the day of the competition. So these are the more short-term goals. The long-term goals is just to have the award vision, where I say, I want to be the this bodybuilder of all times. I want to be the most massive, the most defined, the best poser, and all this thing. So a lot of it, the whole motivation for you to go to the gym every day, everything comes from your mindset. I would say it's as much a mental game as it is a physical gain.

[00:06:00.990] - Speaker 2
There's another aspect to your mental game of bodybuilding that nobody talks about. When you entered bodybuilding, it was a tiny fringe subculture. It seems like in addition to your vision building your body that no one had ever seen one like before, before you, people did not know about bodybuilding. It's like with Bruce Lee, people didn't know about martial arts before Bruce Lee.

[00:06:27.480] - Speaker 1
Right. What was interesting about it I talk a lot about that in my book, be useful, is sell, sell, sell. One of the important things is to really communicate and to make everyone become part of it. Because if you don't really sell your sport well, and if it isn't a popular sport, there's never a chance to make money in it. It was very important to me that I get the sport to that level. Now, when I started out, I thought it was at that level, because when I looked at Joe Wieders' magazine, scenes. I saw the International Federation of Bodybuilding, and I read about the oldest bodybuilders, one of the world that the training is training principles. I saw bodybuilders running around with surfboards under their arms and with the older the girls around them. I saw them being in movies and doing the We Don't Make Waves and all those things that Dave Draper did or the Hercules movies that Steve Reeves and Rich Park did or that Brad Harris did, Commissar X, which is a cop show in Germany, and he's a bodybuilding champion. So all those bodybuilders were working and doing it.

[00:07:36.510] - Speaker 1
This is really huge. This is equivalent to golf or the tennis. But then when I came to America, I realized that the magazine that Joe Wiener published, the Muscle and Fitness and Flex and all those magazines, that it was exaggerated, that it was a take off the Charles Atlas ads, where you're skinny and you're lying on the beach, someone kicks sand in your face, you don't know what to do. You know that they grab your girlfriend and they take her away and you're like an idiot sitting there. You can defend yourself and all of this stuff. So you say to yourself, Okay, I got to go and train. So you get a hold of this Charles Atlas courses. And within a few months, next summer, comes around the corner. Next summer, no one is going to do that to me again. And then, of course, there's exactly the same situation happening again. And now you You punch the guy out, you take the girl, and you're the victor. So this is what Chowita did with his magazine. He made you believe that you're part of this big, big community of this family, bodybuilders, millions of bodybuilders all over the world that we are training in the best gymnasium, in Gold's gym, in Vinci's gym, in all these different gyms.

[00:08:51.820] - Speaker 1
But when I came over to America and I looked at those gyms, they were like gyms a little bit better than in Germany and in Austria, but not much. I felt that Joe Wiede doesn't have really airplanes to deliver food supplements and equipment all over the world. This was a promotional picture where he painted his name on a plane, and that was it. Then That the all these trucks that he had advertised and used in the magazines, that none of that really existed. That his stuff was delivered by the post office or by other delivery services. It was totally made up fantasy stuff that I bought in as a kid. Then when I came over here, I realized that is not the case. That bodybuilding was actually not popular here. Not that it had a terrible reputation, but no one really knew that at the beginning, people I was asking, Wow, look at the body that you have. Muscles, what are you? Are you a bachelor? What are you, are you a football player? They were just guessing every sport other than bodybuilding. And so I said to myself, I think we have to change it.

[00:10:01.360] - Speaker 1
So all of a sudden, my vision and my goals expanded. Instead of just thinking about, I got to become the greatest bodybuilder of all time, it expanded to, I have to make bodybuilding a sport and recognize sport all over the world, because then I can benefit much more from the success of bodybuilding. You can make a living off that. People will be more interested in seeing you in a movie. So I literally I had to hire a publicist in the beginning. I remember in 1974, we hired a publicist that helped us promote bodybuilding and to get met at The Night Show, and then a Muff Griffin show, and then Mike Dimeses show, and all those different shows where I couldn't really explain bodybuilding and get people really excited about it. Then we did the book, Pumping Iron. Then I started writing books, Arnold, The Education of a Bodybuilder, Arnold's Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding in the North, and did speeches all over the world. We promoted and promoted, promoted, got it into movies and did movies myself. Now, the whole thing eventually with the help of many, many other people, bodybuilding has exploded this now into something that literally everyone does, and not just guys, but women, very, very popular amongst women because it makes them feel like this is one way of getting equality.

[00:11:21.160] - Speaker 1
I got to get strong, I got to get fit. I can then do the same job that the guys do. I can go to the military, I can go to join the police force. I can join the fire department because I can get as strong as those guys are, and I can train for that. I think that since then, bodybuilding has taken off and it's gotten really big.

[00:11:40.210] - Speaker 2
If you were to guess, when you started, how many bodybuilders were there in the world?

[00:11:44.630] - Speaker 1
I would say there were probably thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands. But definitely, if you think about that, then the population was around seven billion. Now, we have eight billion population. Now, I I would say that half the world is working out. There's no two ways about that because we can see how the industry is booming. We can see how much money is being made in the food supplement business, how much money is being made in the equipment business, in the gymnasium business, in the franchise business, in all of those areas. I mean, it's just really booming now. And more and more people are joining clubs and they're training at home, and they have their videos so that they can follow people or online. They can follow people, have their exercise. So it has become a real business and a real phenomenon.

[00:12:37.970] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get to meet Charles Atlas?

[00:12:40.170] - Speaker 1
No, I never met Charles Atlas, but I was very happy to meet Reggie Park and Steve Ritz and all those old legends. And then I was able to work with Joe Wieder, who brought me to America. I was able to meet Bob Hoffmann, who was the king of weight lifting back with the AAU Yule. Back in the '60s and '70s, I was able to meet the second client who was one of the early strongmen after Joe Sander, Eugene Sander. I met a lot of the old timers. I met them But I didn't meet Charles Atlas, no. I didn't meet Eugene Sandow, which he was my hero.

[00:13:21.050] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Joe Weter.

[00:13:22.630] - Speaker 1
Joe Weter was an interesting guy that he was a great visionary. He was a great businessman, and he, luckily, was a fanatic about the bodybuild and about physical culture, about training and exercise and all this. I think that there was no one that I've ever met that lived this sport in literally 24 hours a day. There was not one conversation that you would have with him that is not somehow going back to training and to food supplements or equipment and stuff like that. Even though he was somewhat of a Renaissance man because he didn't only teach me about bodybuilding and about selling bodybuilding and selling equipment and food supplements and how to sell and how to approach to customers, how to build a customer base. But he also told me about art. I remember him taking me to art galleries in New York, and I remember him taking me to art auctions. I didn't even know there was such a thing as an art auction when I came to America. He would take me to this art auctions and he would buy art. Then eventually, I got into it when I started to make money, I started buying art, and I started getting interested, having a collection.

[00:14:38.570] - Speaker 1
He really taught me a lot about business, and he was encouraged me always to go take business classes which I did when I came to America. I took English classes, then math classes, then business administration classes, accounting classes, management classes, and all this. Then eventually, I got a degree in business administration, but it was all of Joe inspiring me and saying, You got to learn about business. The only thing that really counts is your brain and how smart you are, because this is something that no one can take away from you. I think that was because he was a Jew I think it was part of his religion and his upbringing, the biggest Jewish people have been taken from the whole history, and they've been killed and all of this stuff. So that he felt always like, We learned a long time ago that the only thing that someone cannot take from you is your intelligence, your brainpower. And we also really developed that. That is really at the end. You can buy cars, you can buy art, you can buy houses, you can buy real estate, you can invest in different things. But the best investment in the end is your head, it's your brain.

[00:15:50.730] - Speaker 1
And I listened to him. There was a lot of other men and women that I listened to that helped me, to inspire me in this various different directions to go beyond just bodybuilding and to learn other things.

[00:16:03.620] - Speaker 2
Were you in love with bodybuilding or was it a means to an end?

[00:16:08.190] - Speaker 1
Both. I was in love with bodybuilding simply because, and this is something that I also talk in my book, being used for is that you have to find your talent. I was searching for my talent. I was searching my whole childhood. What is it that I could Excel in? What could I be the best in? I was playing soccer, I was since the ice crawling, all the different things. But when I started lifting weight, I felt like something clicked. I felt I found something that I could be good at. At first, it was weight lifting, Olympic lifting. Then it was power lifting. Then eventually, it turned into bodybuilding. I did them all three for a while, and it was fantastic. They started getting obsessed with that. The idea of being able to build muscles, to rebuild your body, to build it in the mystery universe physique. But at the same time, I felt like my dream is to get to America. I was not happy in Austria. I was not happy growing up around farms. When I saw newsreels and news footage of America, I always felt like, that's where I want to be. When I see this high rises of New York, when I see the Golden Gate Bridge, when I see the six-lane highways with those big cars with big wings in the back going down the highway, this old big Cadillacs, Chevolets.

[00:17:36.450] - Speaker 1
I was absolutely inspired by that. I said, I got to be part of this country. I got to go to America. I don't feel like I'm really Austrian. I think I'm an American. I felt like, Okay, how do you get to America? You can buy a ticket and you can fly with it, but then when you go with it, you can get to be a visitor. How do you get a But how do you do any of that? I wanted to move to America. So I felt like, Well, bodybuilding actually is an American sport. If I get really good at bodybuilding, if I become a world champion, I think America would notice me. And somehow, I didn't even think about Joe Wida at this point. That's just somehow someone would invite me to America to compete in America at a Mr. Universe, Carlos, Mr. World Competition, Mr. Ola Beer, or whatever. And that's exactly what happened after I won my second Mr. Universe title in London in 1968. I always had got a telegram from Joe Wida and with an invitation. He says, I'm sending you the Yorkline tickets. I want you to come to Miami to compete in the Mr. Universe contest and then Maybe you think about training over here and staying over here for a while.

[00:18:48.770] - Speaker 1
I said, Oh, my God, this couldn't be true. I mean, that another one of my dreams and visions is becoming a reality. It was just unbelievable. I came to America, I took I put down a daughter. They came over here with just a gym bag and literally just $20. I didn't have enough money. I remember asking Joe Wida in Miami for some money because I said, If I arrive in Los Angeles, I wouldn't have the money to go with a taxi to an apartment or to the gym or anything like this. So he gave me some cash and helped me out. I came to America and it never left since.

[00:19:30.510] - Speaker 2
Do you think if you were born in America, you would have the same love for it, or do you think the distance allowed the fantasy to be more powerful?

[00:19:40.210] - Speaker 1
Well, this is obviously just guessing. Yeah, hypothetically. Because we don't know. I cannot tell you would I love America the same way today as an American one, or do I love it more because I'm a foreign one? That I don't know. But I can tell you one thing that I have a tremendous love for America, and I feel truly that America gave me everything. So America, for the very fact that I saw it when I was 10 years old, I saw the footage, black and white footage of America. It was the thing that inspired me to go to America. It inspired me to get into bodybuilding. It inspired me to become a world champion in bodybuilding so I can come to America. Then when I came to America, America helped me to become even a greater champion in bodybuilding because now I was training here with the best bodybuilders in the world and with the best equipment in the world. Everything was the best. So America helped me to become the greatest bodybuilder of all time and winning seven Mr. Olympia competitions and five Mr. University, Mr. World, and Mr. International, and all this stuff.

[00:20:54.890] - Speaker 1
The 13 World Bodybuilding Championships is extraordinary. I mean, the most anyone has ever won. And then to go on and to get into the movie business, and not only to get into it and to be an actor, but to become a movie star, which was one of my dreams, and to become a celebrity And then to do the movies, the blockbuster movies. Because there's a lot of people that get in movies, but then to be fortunate enough to work with directors like Jim Cameron, or Ivan Reitman, or John McTurnan, people like that. John Williams, they did Colin a Barbarian. We work with people like that. That is unbelievable. I mean, what a privilege to work with directors like that. They are the ones that made me become a box office hit. When Terminator 2 came out, it was the biggest movie of the year, not only in domestic view, but in the national. That really helped my career. My career was skyrocketing, and I was starting to make $30 million a movie. I had to get 20% back and stuff like that. That was really great, great deals. It was really extraordinary. So I mean, I learned everything here in America, then I learned super bodybuilding.

[00:22:10.480] - Speaker 1
This is why I wanted to let people know that, look, here's how I learned my lessons in life. I wrote them down and I wrote them in my book so that others can learn from that because it doesn't do me any good if only I know about it. I want other people to know about it, too. They're not really secret It's just common sense stuff that I learned throughout the years in bodybuilding it in the gym and working on movie sets and working in Sacramento as governor and all that stuff. I mean, it's an unbelievable education that I got. I have to say that just being up in Sacramento, this capital, the capital became like a university. I learned every day. It was really amazing.

[00:22:55.950] - Speaker 2
When you list the great directors that you worked with, if you think of each of them, would you say there are any qualities that they all shared? What made those people so great from your perspective?

[00:23:08.680] - Speaker 1
Well, I think that all of them had vision. When they tell you the movie that they want to do, they will look out into emptyness, and they will tell you of what the movie will be about, and what's important in this movie, and how you should play the role in this movie, and what they're driving to across. So they were visionaries, all of them. The other thing that is a common thing, and this is the thing, again, I mentioned in the book is here, the tools for life. Some of the tools is don't think small, think big. And those guys were big thinkers. It was not like, Oh, let me do a little movie. No. It was like, Let us do a movie that really will be a huge splash. They will be daring enough. Like the Jim Cameron, for instance, he took on this Terminator movie, and then he did a second one, the sequel. But to be able to go and to take the Terminator, that machine that was killing everything in the first one, and to say, I'm going to go and surprise the people. I'm going to go and make the Terminator, a good guy that saves people.

[00:24:17.540] - Speaker 1
Then another machine come back from the future and be the destroyer, the Terminator. I was like, doubting it. I was worried about it. He had the balls to go and say, Yeah, that's what that movie we do. And sure enough, it became the hugest hit. It became the hugest hit of the entire year by changing the character. So then they also do that. If Ivan Reitman, he had the boss to take me as an action hero and to say, Arnold, I'm going to go and make you famous, not as an action hero, but also as a comedy hero. And I said, wow, that would be really fantastic. And he created the movie Twins. And he said, okay, I'm going to have Danny DeVito and you be twins. And so that was funny to me right off the top. But then he go, to go and to say, when the studio said, we don't want the movie which was Nigger, that's a comedy. Then he would put a picture together. He would have the script written. He would have Danny DeVito and me. We both go in together. We all three of us go in together to Tom Pollack, the Universal Studio, and we go in to hype him the movie and make the deal right there.

[00:25:33.440] - Speaker 1
He went for it, and Pete, Ivan Radman, saw it as a huge, huge successful movie. Sure enough, when the movie Twins came out, he was number one at the box office, and he made the most money of any movie that I've ever made at that point. It just shows you how daring these guys were, how much guts they had, and how they did not take a no for an answer. There was Steve If they said it would never work, don't do it. This is a big mistake. The same thing he said to Jim Cameron, the same thing they said to John Millius when he said, Okay, Arnold is going to be Conan. And Ed Pressman also said that Arnold is going to be colon. And Dina Delerandis said in the beginning, No, I don't want that. They forced their way through it, and that became colon. And sure enough, after the third day of filming, Dina Delerandis came up to me. It was in the studio this warehouse in Madrid, that we were filming the orgy scene that was in the movie. We shot it at the beginning of the movie. I remember that there was this freezing cold warehouse where we shot the scenes, and then the dealer came up the stairs, up the stairs, and he came right in front of me, and he hated me.

[00:26:51.940] - Speaker 1
He didn't want me to be colonized. He came up to me, right in my face, and he said, As Vatilagre, you're colonized. And turned around and walked off. So Chad Millius comes over to me, running over to me, says, What do you say? What do you say? I said, You said, Schwarzenegger, you're calling. Chad Millius, the director, just jumped all over me, hugged me, gave me a big, big bear hug, and he says, Congratulations, Alan. This is the greatest compliment that you can ever get from Dino. Dino loves the dailies. He watched all the footage we've shot the last three days. He loved it. He could say, Arnold, there's colon. You got match. This is a compliment. This is great. I said, Well, I felt like I was shocked that he didn't say more. I mean, it's just a colon. He says, No, no. That's all you want to hear. He says, Trust me, that's all you want to hear. That's really fantastic. John Mill is in there, put out right away a cigar to celebrate the whole thing, and we were smoking up a storm right then on the set. But we were all then so excited that Dina finally bought in with the idea I'm colon.

[00:28:00.970] - Speaker 1
Since then, our relationship has been fantastic. Tina and I did other movies after that together, and he became a mentor to me. He treated me always like a son, and he was absolutely fantastic. I was very, very sad that he passed away. I think he was 91 years old. He never worked that in his life, but he always ate well and he lived a healthy life, I think. He passed away with 91. I also did this eulogy When he passed away, he had the cathedral in downtown Los Angeles. He was just a wonderful man, and I just love the guy.

[00:28:37.690] - Speaker 2
What's it like going through life, having people over and over tell you you can't do something, and then you do it in the biggest, most beautiful, successful way possible. What does it feel like?

[00:28:49.470] - Speaker 1
Well, I first felt like an idiot because there was this, why does everyone always say, No, you're going to fail in that? Oh, you're never going to make it. You're never going to go to America. What are you talking about? Do you want to be a world champion? Why are you really in this American sport? You're Austin. Why don't you try to play soccer or learn to ski or something like that? Everything was always no, no, no. Then when I came to America, no one to get in the movies to say, Oh, yeah, sure. That's a good one. You in movies, I mean, look, Hercules movies are out. Then the new idles are Duss Hoffmann and Art Machina and the Woody Allen, that those are the new guys. They're all way out of 20, 140 pounds. You have 250-pound body is out. Forget about it. It was always no, no, no. Even when I was going to run for governor, they said, Oh, we have to start them first for mayor, run for mayor, then for state senator. But you can't just go for governor. This is crazy. So it always was no. But then I found out as time went on, this is the most common thing that people do, that if they hear a dream or a vision that is outrageous, people will just It's impossible.

[00:30:01.600] - Speaker 1
It's a natural thing. I'm sure you have heard that, right?

[00:30:06.320] - Speaker 2
Every step of the way. Every step of the way.

[00:30:09.170] - Speaker 1
Exactly. But it's because you do great things. Of course, when you say, Now, I want I want to do this record, I want to produce this record, I want to bring this and this musician together, I want to do this and that stuff at the stadium. So they say, No way. A guy is out. He's never is going to be. It's always a reason why they see No, it can't be done. And so this is one of the lessons that I talk about also in my book is just don't listen to the naysayers because if you have a clear vision, that's where you go. So I think one of the things that all of the people, the directors that you mentioned that worked with me that were really fantastic directors. One of the things that they had in common, all of them was that they had the vision, that they had the guts to do it, that they didn't think small, they thought big, and they didn't listen to the naysayers. That's one of the things. I myself, now, I feel like it's really a compliment when someone says it's impossible because it means that it goes back to what Nelson Mandela said, Everything is always impossible until someone does it.Yes.Right?Yes. Okay, I love it when someone said, Oh, it's impossible, Arnold.

[00:31:20.990] - Speaker 1
Instead, that actually motivates me to say, Okay, I'm going to show you that it is possible. Then I break this new ground, and then everyone else can do it. Yes. Then everyone else says it's possible. It goes back to weight lifting and there's many other examples because in weight lifting, I remember it was always impossible to clean a jerk, to lift up ahead 500 pounds or over 500 pounds. They tried, they tried, they tried. Everyone always said, This can't be done. This can't be done. We're always failing and all this. Then one time, a Russian weightlifter, the name of Alexiev, he went and he says, Okay, I want 498 pounds. You wanted to do this third lift. He wanted to be safe. Still break his record, his other record was 496. He wanted to go 498 because then they go back to Russia and they get money for that. Anyway, it was in Columbus, Ohio, and he put on the 498, and he lifted it, pop, over here. Wait, it's down. Three green lights light up means it was a good lift. Now, of course, because it's a world record, they have to it onto the scale because there have to be three charges, seeing that in fact it is...

[00:32:35.380] - Speaker 1
With those plates, it can always be a little bit off. We don't know. Anyway, they rolled it out, and it was 501 pounds. Wow. So now the the world has seen the human being, because they didn't know it was 501 pounds, people would have known it maybe wouldn't have lifted it. Yes. But anyway, so now it's 501 pounds. That very same year, four other weightlifters lifted over 500 pounds.

[00:32:58.510] - Speaker 2
Amazing. After it being It's impossible.

[00:33:00.620] - Speaker 1
I don't mean being impossible, but it just shows you the power of the mind. Yes. Because you were asking me how much body building has to do with the body and the mind. The mind is extremely important in every step of the way in your life. Yes, we can will things through it, but the will comes from your mind. Being able to say, I don't care if everyone says no, and it's impossible, I see it, I know I can do it, I'm convinced I can do it. To go all out to do it. It's in weight lifting, we've seen it in the... Remember the four-minute mile? Running a mile, the four minutes. There's endless amount of examples where people have shown the possible becoming possible. And so I think the key thing with all of this is, you know it because you're successful. I know it because I'm successful. But there's a lot of people out there that don't feel they're successful. And there is always something or a lot of things that are holding them back from being successful. And the little thing like not having a vision, not knowing where to go, what to do next, can trip you up and already make you freeze.

[00:34:15.410] - Speaker 1
And they say, What should I do? Or if they listen to people that say, It can't be done. It's stupid. Don't even try that. So many things like that, all these people that are just loners, and they don't know how to connect with people. And I always tell people it is so important to recognize that we are all in the company. We all love to do things together. Don't float around by yourself. It's a waste. You got to be with people. Be with people. I love training with people. I love bicycling with people. I like going to dinner with people. I like talking with people. I like traveling with people. I like going to the football with people. I like to go skiing with people. We have people that need company because then you have great conversations and you inspire each other. We can't do it alone because there's no such thing. That's why I say there's no such thing as a self-made man because we all need this inspiration and this help. I always urge people. That's why I wrote this book because I wanted to let people know, here are some rules that you can use that can help you forward, and it helped you also to be successful.

[00:35:35.650] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the camaraderie of the bodybuilding community when you joined it. What was the feeling? Were they helpful to each other? Did everyone support each other? Tell me about it.

[00:35:44.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah, absolutely. It was like, almost without saying it, we understood that not everyone is always at your height every day for no reason. We get up sometimes and things are a little off. It's not that someone has taken money from you or you have always made a big deal, you lost your house. No, there's no reason at all. But when you have friends, you cheer each other up and you inspire each other. When you go to the gym, it's just translated to gym and to the bodybuilding, I would go with my friends and I would meet them, let's say, Hey, look, I get in the morning in the gym. We start working out. I would just say, all the day, I don't really feel good. I don't know. Everything is sore. He said, I just don't feel with the program the day. Franco would say, my training partner, he would say, Why don't we just use very little weight? Let's just use light weights. Let's just do high reps. We will lie down and we will just do high chips and with low weights. Then all of a sudden, after half an hour, Franco would say, Let's put a little extra plate on it.

[00:36:51.720] - Speaker 1
Let's just try it out. It always led me to realize that now I've gotten over this period of where everything is painful, everything is and blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff, feeling bad about myself. Then all of a sudden, I was in the go beyond that. And all of a sudden, the weight set and it's still really good. He says, Okay, maybe we should put some more weight in the next set. I stood together and said, I don't feel that great today. I don't care. But let's just see how far we can go. You start talking each other through that. All of a sudden, because you have two, three training partners, you pop each other up and you forget about this. Then all of a sudden, you end up with a great, great workout. This training partner said, pulled you out this dark spa, but it didn't feel good when you came into the gym, and now you left the gym feeling great and going for lunch now together with the gang, and feeling that you had a great pop in everything. I think They're doing things together and supporting each other and pumping each other up, I think it's so important.

[00:37:50.770] - Speaker 1
It's also fun. When I see someone doing an exercise in the gym and I see them doing half reps, and I said to them, Is it you plan on doing half reps? No, why? Am I doing half reps? I don't want to criticize you, but it seems to me that if you go to a pull-down exercise, why not go all the way up to the top with your arms. They pull all the way down with where the bar goes to your chest and then all the way up again. That's the full motion. I said, That's what I would do. I always found out in my training that the more I do full movement, the better it works. Then I said, Well, thank you very much. That's the view that you say that. I said, Well, let me just check it out. Let's go for it. Then I just called out the reps for them. They feel fantastic. They have just now learned something. This is how you help each other. Even with strangers. I do it with strangers because it makes me feel good that I could help someone else because I know how great it makes me feel when someone helps me.

[00:38:56.430] - Speaker 1
This is always like a give and take with everything like that. This is why I always say to people, give back. Don't just take, but give back. It's very, very important. It can make it feel just as good as receiving is giving something.

[00:39:10.840] - Speaker 2
When I was a little kid, your book, The Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding, came out. Everyone I knew had it. It was like the Bible. It was the reference book that every kid used who was inspired by you or by bodybuilding and just wanted to get in the shape. It's amazing. How successful is that book been over the course of its life? Must be insane.

[00:39:32.880] - Speaker 1
Oh, yes, it is insane. It's really unbelievable. I think that's what it's all about. I don't know if you remember when Mikey Kibis connected us.

[00:39:43.070] - Speaker 2
Yes, I remember because I called you because I was about to have a surgery and I was terrified and you had the surgery. I thought, if I talked to someone who had the surgery and lived, it would feel better than just going in blind. You really helped me a lot.

[00:39:58.350] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but that's what I'm talking about. See, I've known you and I've known your career, and I've known your successes, and I know what a spectacular producer you are and making the most extraordinary records, working with the hugest fans in rock stars and all this stuff. I knew what this is, but no matter how successful you are and how powerful you are, that is the scary thing to go through to have a heart surgery. It's the scary thing. I remember when I went through Of course, when I went through it, I called people and asked them, What was it like to have a heart surgery? They would skype me through it. Don't worry about it, Arnold. I mean, it's just one of those things. They would take good care of you, going to the hospital, blah, blah, blah. When I heard that you have a heart surgery, and then Michael Kevian said, Do you want to talk to him? I said, Of course, I want to talk to him. I said, Because I need to let him know that it is not... It is a big deal, but then I had, It's not a big deal because he You don't have to do anything.

[00:41:01.210] - Speaker 1
The heart surgeon is doing all the work. You're just lying there under anesthesia. Then you wake up and then here's what to expect. We went through it, what you expect when you wake up and from that point on and all this stuff. You've done unbelievable because you've taken all the advice. How much weight did you lose since then?

[00:41:23.580] - Speaker 2
I lost 130 pounds over the course of from when mine was heavy. It's unbelievable.

[00:41:28.560] - Speaker 1
Miracle. How linear now. It literally took 10 years of your life. Yes. Age-wise, it made you 10 years younger by being now leaner and everything like that. But this is the very thing I'm talking about is that it made me feel great that I could go and pump you up before heart surgery and then go and make you feel like it's okay. That's just the way it did. Because the last thing you want is have the heart surgery and worry about it like crazy. Anyway, this idea... And this thing is not... Of course, there will be people that will be calling you and say, Hey, I have heart surgery. Tell me all about it. Then you pump them up and you spend a half an hour, or an hour, or two hours on the phone with them, and you talk to them and you make them feel good. This is what I'm talking about. It's so important that we recognize we are so powerful if we do things things together and not just think that I could do it by myself or I can do it myself. There's no such thing. It's all not that we need each other.

[00:42:40.210] - Speaker 1
That is the key thing.

[00:42:41.610] - Speaker 2
I remember when I called you, you were in Europe, we were in a very different time zone tone, and you were smoking a cigar and playing poker. But you took time out from the game to talk to me. I just remember the scene. It was just such a wild scene growing up watching you, now talking to you, smoking a cigar, playing poker, and trying calm me down about heart surgery. It was a wild experience. I thank you very much again for that.

[00:43:05.450] - Speaker 1
No, you're welcome. How is everything going with the music business?

[00:43:10.020] - Speaker 2
Everything's cool. Making music like a fiend. Can't stop.

[00:43:15.300] - Speaker 1
We worked together back on Last Action Hero, right? Yes.

[00:43:20.040] - Speaker 2
I produced the AC/DC song that was for the soundtrack for The Last Action Hero.

[00:43:25.500] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and then I was in it in the music video with them. It was really a lot of fun. I think the story was of me going in there and not really approving of the crowd that much and just being amazed. Everything I saw got very close to the musicians and checked out and they made their moves and the way they played the guitar and all that. It was a lot of fun doing that because by that time, I have done one other one which was with Axel Rose, Guns & Roses. We have done it for Terminator 2. I really enjoyed that. That was also fun to do. I said, Yeah, it's really amazing that I'm getting involved, even though I'm not musically inclined, even though I love music, but I'm not musically inclined. My father played six instruments. Really? With trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, fleet one, and all of those instruments. He was also the conductor at the Chender Marie, which is the police music in Stereo, the province that I grew up in. He was playing a lot of funerals and a lot of times out in the city park where he dragged us to listen to him, which, of course, we had no interest in.

[00:44:47.780] - Speaker 1
He always wanted me to learn an instrument, so I just never got it. He tried to teach me how to play the trumpet, but I didn't get it. Then he decided to go and have me go to the farmer next who was also a musician, and he played the guitar. He tried to teach me how to play the guitar, and I didn't get that either. It was the legacy. I did not understand when they had the music, the notes, and all of that. I just didn't quite connect the dots there. And so they just gave up.

[00:45:16.920] - Speaker 2
Did your dad used to play in the house? Would you hear him play?

[00:45:20.370] - Speaker 1
Oh, no. There was a kid, my school colleague, that was living 100 yards from us in a little shack. And They were poorer than we were. He was very talented. He still did they played the trumpet, the free one. My father would go and open up the windows when I was working out outside in our house. While I was working out, he would be playing the trumpet. My friend then started playing the trumpet across the street around the alley, the other way, also the trumpet. The whole neighborhood heard us play the trumpet, heard all this music. They were going back and forth, back and forth. He was It was wonderful.

[00:46:01.000] - Speaker 2
Do you think that your dad's work ethic with music inspired your work ethic in the gym?

[00:46:07.660] - Speaker 1
He was very disciplined, and he wrote music. I remember him writing the notes and all the pages after pages after pages with the black ink and with the pen, just put the ink well and then just would write the music and all that stuff. And so he was really into it. I mean, it was like music was it. I don't know where he got it really from, to be honest with you because I don't know. I think maybe my relative's man, that he maybe comes from music, I don't know. But he was really into it.

[00:46:37.950] - Speaker 2
You mentioned earlier about when Franco said, maybe we'll do lighter weights, more reps. Tell me about heavy weights Less reps versus lighter weights, more reps. What's the philosophy?

[00:46:48.610] - Speaker 1
Well, first of all, it's always better to go lighter weights and more reps.

[00:46:53.890] - Speaker 2
Why?

[00:46:54.430] - Speaker 1
Because so many people injure themselves. Because if you don't have a really skilled trainer with you. There's a lot of exercises that you do, like squats, deadlifts, bend over rowing, and shoulder presses, and stuff like that, where you really can hurt your back, and then you can make in the knees, and your hips and your hips, and your shoulders, and all that stuff, and upper back. So I always say to people, I say, If you train, in most cases, which is rather called lighter than heavier. I have found the joy of lighter training only by accident. Then really, because after I had my heart surgery, the doctor said to me, Look, we replaced your bowels. So don't go anymore like... It's like, Lift 600 pounds. It's over. Is it because every time we do that restraining, and you keep your ear in and you try to lift the heavyweight, it puts a lot of pressure on that valve. The idea of it is to have that bowel last the as long as possible. Eventually, we have to replace the valve, maybe in 10 years from now, maybe in 15 years from now. But the more heavy you train, the faster we have to replace.

[00:48:11.250] - Speaker 1
There's the... I mean, forget that. I'm going to go and shift Now, I'm going to just do 15, 20 reps, everything, until a lighter weight that I can easily do and really concentrate on these movements and get the same pump. That's what I started doing. I tell you something, my injuries went away and I still felt great physically. I still got the pump and everything like this. I realized that it is not advantageous to overload. Yes, if you are young, you're 15, 20 years old, and you really want your muscles to grow, and yes, you want to gain strength. Then you have to do power lifting training. Then you have to go and do the first set, 15 reps, then 10 reps, 5 reps, 3 reps, Three reps, three reps. In order to really let the mind and the body know this is the weight you need to lift, so to get comfortable with a heavy, heavy weight. So yes, there are moments like that. I did all of that when I was in weight lifting and power lifting, competing. My best deadlift was like 710 pounds. With squats, I was doing like 600 and bench press 525 and all that stuff.

[00:49:26.580] - Speaker 1
So yeah, I lift it heavy weights. But there comes a time where you got to get off the heavy weights and then lift lighter weights, do the exercises correct. The key thing now is the mental aspect again, that you got to be inside your body when you train. Just to go look around and to go through the motion is not going to do anything. You have to really concentrate. When I train my bicep, I'm with my mind inside the bicep. When I train my chest, I'm inside my pectrum muscles in my chest. So I really mentally feel when I do chin-ups, I feel the lats and the wings in the back moving and all this stuff. So I think the key thing is to really concentrate. And I think that all the great athletes will tell you that the more you are inside the sport, the more you look at it also as a mental thing, the better it is for you, the more success you will have.

[00:50:30.060] - Speaker 2
Do you think it would be possible to put yourself inside the movement and do it with no weights, but still get the experience of the weight just mentally? Is it possible?

[00:50:40.310] - Speaker 1
Absolutely, you're good. It's something that you would do if you don't have weights around that it's better than not doing anything. It's like I remember the weightlifters, when they didn't have weights to train with and they would travel around the world to go to a World Championship competition, they would just press against some door. Inside the door, they would just press against the door frier. They will pull against something really hard, so something static, and they will get just as much of a workout doing that, and much, much better than not doing anything. That's always, I think, the key thing.

[00:51:16.800] - Speaker 2
How did the movie Pumping Iron come about?

[00:51:19.520] - Speaker 1
Well, it's interesting you asked that because it was number one, it was Pumping Iron that got Ed Pressman, the idea to buy the colon rights and to have me play Konan. Incredible. It was Pumping Iron. It was not Stay Under or any of the other projects that I've done. It was pumping iron because there I could show my personality and everything. Well, George Butler, who was the photographer for the book Pumping Iron that came out in, I think, in '72 or '73, and the writer was Charles Gaines. He came to me in 1975 and said, I would like to do the documentary of bodybuilding, and we called it Pumping Iron. I said, Great. He says, But the only problem was you have retired last year if your body was in competition, so you would have to come back and compete again. Because otherwise, I don't have a documentary. If you're not competing in it, I don't have a documentary. I said, Let me think about it. I thought about it for a while, and then I told him, Okay, I go back to the competition, go down to South Africa, where the Ms. Olympic competition was in Pretoria and the competitor gang.

[00:52:25.360] - Speaker 1
They would film my training and also my competitors, my competition, filmed their training also. That's what they did. For the next four months, they filmed, filmed, filmed everything, all my training and the competition itself and all that stuff. Then after they've edited it, they actually saw some stories that came out of filming that were not fully developed. Then they went and shot after it was done in order to make the stories become alive, so to speak. But they were not really true stories. They were bogus. The only thing in pumping out that was true, it was reality, was the training and the competition. But everything Anything else when you saw, for instance, Mike Katz looking for his underwear backstage, and it made it sound like Ken Waller, his competitor friend, he hit them to throw him off a little bit. That was only just because they had the footage of him looking for the underwear. But now they said, Let's go back and see Ken Waller saying, I'm going to hide this underwear. I'm going to fuck up his brain a little bit. I think that he may lose because of the Joe Mike Katz loss, the competition with Ken Waller Those were the things that were fabricated, little things like that.

[00:53:50.620] - Speaker 1
That's why we wanted the dark in drama rather than the documentary. But everything else was a real documentary. It was the real footage. Because people got really interested in the personalities in the movie. It became a huge hit. It became one of the most popular documentaries, I think, of all time. It was huge. It was played in Cannes when we went over there to the film festivals. It was a huge splash. We got international release for the movie. It really got the attention as a regular movie would get, except it was a documentary. It cost around $800,000, I that originally $500,000, the budget eventually made to $850,000, and it was a fantastic success. I was very happy that I was in it. It helped my career. I think when the Hollywood Press saw Pumping Iron, I think they gave me the Golden Global Award for Stay Hungry, which was a movie I did just before then because of Pumping Iron. I think that they saw both of those movies. Then they saw my personality, and they got the Golden Global Award as a best actor in the debut because of Staying Honest. But I think it was also because of Pumping Iron.

[00:55:05.030] - Speaker 1
So Pumping Iron was really very important for me and for my career and for bodybuilding. Remember that this movie, this documentary, is being seen day and night in thousands and thousands of Tunasians on over the world all day long. In Gold Shipp, you walk in there at 7:00 in the morning, Pumping Out is on. You walk in there at 7:00 at night, pumping an iron sound. Kids and people get inspired God, but you still can see it on television. I mean, it's really fantastic.

[00:55:34.390] - Speaker 2
It's a beautiful movie, and it really is inspiring, and it gives us a view of a world that you can't imagine. If you're not in that world, you can't picture it.

[00:55:42.750] - Speaker 1
I just want to tell you also that when I talk about there's so many ingredients that helped to make bodybuilding as big as it is today. One of those ingredients is George Butler that directed Coming on and Charles that wrote the book Hopping Out, and also that wrote the book Stay Hunger, which is the movie that I did. Those guys came along in the early '70s, and they did a lot of features for various different magazines about bodybuilding and other sports. When they came around, they started articulating so well and photographing bodybuilding. This is really what had a tremendous impact. All of a sudden, the book, Pumping Iron became a best seller, and it was selling everywhere around the world, and bodybuilding became more and more popular. Those guys were extremely important for the growth of bodybuilding in the early stage.

[00:56:44.250] - Speaker 2
Tell me something about bodybuilding that people who are not bodybuilders can't know?

[00:56:48.620] - Speaker 1
I think that probably what people should know is that it doesn't matter if you're five years old or if you're 100 years old, you can do it. People always think this is for young people, but it's not. There is a guy with the name of Henry Downs, that is a Canadian bodybuilder. He's now 90, some years old. I competed with him at the Mr. Universe contest in London. I was 19, and he was already over 30 years old. He was like 36 or whatever. He was one of the oldest part. He was one of his competitors. I just saw a month ago a video of him still in his 90s.Incredible.I mean, think about that.

[00:57:34.150] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:57:34.600] - Speaker 1
It just shows to you there is people that are working out, women and men, that are working out and they're doing it for forever. They feel like that this as you know, it would help. What is interesting about it is in the old days, it was an absolute no-no to do weight training. As far as what the guy, he wasn't Henry Towns, he was Big Towns, that I was talking about where I'm being the Canadian guy the week down. I just remember it's first week down. But anyway, so in the early days, when I got involved in bodybuilding, this bodybuilding is bad for your health. You get muscle bound, it's bad for your heart, it's bad for this, it's bad for that, and all that stuff. Now it's exactly the opposite. All the research has shown that if you do exercises every day, that it belongs in life. It doesn't matter if you're women or men. It doesn't matter what your condition is, your health condition. You They're doing their hardware exercise every day, and now they're using it for therapy. I mean, weight resistance training has become the number one thing. My girlfriend is a physical therapist, and she has a clinic in Santa Monica here.

[00:58:45.380] - Speaker 1
She's 46 people working for her. She's 150 to 200 patients coming through every day, and they all work out and do resistance with weights. The football players that are coming in that they have surgery, It's knee surgery, they're working out with weights right after that. The baseball players that are having shoulder surgeries and elbow surgeries, they immediately go back to the weight resistance training. I mean, heart patients to weight resistance training. I mean, everyone is doing weight resistance training. This is where the action is today. Everything that they used to think is bad, now everyone is writing about it, that it is the best thing that you can do, and you have to do it every day.

[00:59:28.480] - Speaker 2
Amazing. Konan was the first movie after Pump Iron?

[00:59:32.830] - Speaker 1
No. I did first Stay Honest was in '75, and then after was Pump Iron, '75, '76. Then after that, I did Streets of San Francisco and the Jane Mansfield story. Then it was a movie with Kirk Douglas, and then Margaret called the Villain. Then after that, I got the Cone and Roll. It was the first in the big studio movie. It was the number one. It came out number one in the box office. Matter of fact, when we had test screenings in Las Vegas, they had a theater for 500 people, and out there was 3,000 people standing in line, 3,000. Every gymnasium, I think, in Vegas and around Vegas or the mother, they heard that Konan was being screened, so they all came to the theater, and they had to three more screenings after that because people wouldn't leave. They had three more screenings. When Universal Studio heard about it, they were so ecstatic, they started to put in more money in the budget of the promotion of the movie and all that, and the movie was very, very successful.

[01:00:46.590] - Speaker 2
What was the experience like going on to a set, starring in a movie, not a bodybuilding movie, but an acting movie, an action movie, essentially? What was it like? What was going on in your head?

[01:00:58.210] - Speaker 1
Well, I felt that I had to do the work because Conan is one of those roles, one of the lifetime role. I have to admit. So you get it right or you don't. To me, it was important, and I think the director, John Millias, he had me watch Mifuni in the seventh Samaray's, and he said, Watch Mifuni and watch Seventh Summer Rise very carefully because this is the attitude that Konan should have. And that's exactly when I saw it, I said, Oh, Bafuni is like a sword master. I mean, he looked fantastic as a Samurai. So okay, I got the message from Millias, I should really practice the sword really a lot. And so three years before the movie was filmed, in 1977, I started working with the sword and with the sword master by the name of Yamazaki, Sentium Yamazaki, who just passed away literally 10 days ago, whatever it was. But he became my trainer, and he spent every week, three times, three hours with me practicing with sword. But let me only summarize swords, bronze swords, and wooden swords and plastic swords and all kinds of different swords he would bring around, and then practicing with axes, and with spears and all this.

[01:02:25.950] - Speaker 1
And so we would practice, and practice, and practice. And then the horseback riding was also extremely poor. I would just train the horseback riding, going out here with Terry Leonard, who was the stunt coordinator of Canon. He would take me out three times a week horseback riding. Then when we went to Spain, months before we started filming, I was horseback riding every single day, all day long. I was sitting in a horse. We were going for lunch with the horse, we were going for dinner with the horse. Everything was in the horse. It became second nature. Then having always the sword with me, practicing the sword. When we actually started filming, I never really got intimidated by the scenes, so overwhelmed by the scenes, because I always felt I was ready. It was the seven-piece proper prior planning prevents pissable performance. This is what it was. It was like, Arnold, just be prepared. That the proper prior planning is extremely important because you don't want to give a shitty performance. This is what I was training, training, and training, practicing, and practicing, and rehearsing the scenes, the dialog. There was two actors that were genius actors.

[01:03:39.480] - Speaker 1
One was James Earl Jones, who is unbelievable. He played Thauser Doon. I went to him regularly to his motorhome to work with me on my acting and then how to deliver the lines in a more dramatic way and all this stuff. Then there was Max Conceder, who was now an academy, winning nominating the character who was extraordinary, who was in the movie, played the priest in the Exorcist, and he did many other movies, of course. But he played the King, King Harold, I think was his name, King Conan. Anyway, I went to him also to his trailer and asked him to help me with my acting. I would just... Anyone that was able to help me, I would ask him for the help. Because I always say, Just shut your mouth and open your mind. This is always my rule. It's one of the rules in my book because instead of talking so much when you go to the set, just listen to the wise actors that are there and just open your mind and let them teach you how to become better and greater. That's how you become successful.

[01:04:49.210] - Speaker 2
It's really about being humble enough to be open to learn, to not feel like you know everything, not feel like you have to do it your way, but to learn the wisdom from the people around you with more experience.

[01:05:00.310] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. There's no one that I know that likes to learn more than me. I mean, I'm like a sponge. That's why I love to listen because I always feel like there's so much that you need to learn out of it. You're fucking idiot. You know nothing. I beat myself up all the time. You know nothing. Open up your mind and just listen. It was like, it doesn't matter if you're in Sacramento and you listen to the legislators, to all of their various different problems that they have. Listen, listen, listen, and then listen to the experts that have the softest problems. It doesn't matter if it's a Democrat or a Republican. Listen and just let them get all this information in your mind, and that's how you get enriched. And so I did this with movie making. I did this in politics, policy, in my after-school programs with education and Special Olympics. I became the international coach of Special Olympics. I listened very carefully, How do you deal with the Special Olympics? How do you train with them? How do you train them? How do you reward them? And all this stuff. It was like, life to me is an ongoing never-ending learning experience.

[01:06:17.720] - Speaker 1
As soon as you feel like you know it all, that's when you're the stupidest, because otherwise, you would never think you know it all.

[01:06:26.810] - Speaker 2
When you first went into acting or when you first went into politics, do you think that there was some advantage you had by not having experience or not having the baggage of the past, that you were coming in with a clean slate? Was that one of the strengths you had?

[01:06:40.220] - Speaker 1
Well, it has certain advantages when you naïve. Because I remember when I became governor, one of the Republicans said, because I made a certain decision, and he said to his Republican colleagues, he says, I support Governor Schwarzenegger, and they were always supported, but we have to recognize that he's politically naive. I was sitting right there when he said that. I didn't feel offended by it at all because the fact was I was, but it was my advantage because by being naive and by not accepting just things the way they were, made me recognize that we in America have gerrymandering, and gerrymandering is the evil of all evils.

[01:07:28.810] - Speaker 2
Explain to me about gerrymandering. I don't know anything about it.

[01:07:31.650] - Speaker 1
It's just the whole United States is carved up in districts. This is where our representatives from, like a congressman who have a certain district, Congressional district. The way every 10 years, because the population moves around, sometimes it's more and more what is going here or there, and there's more foreigners here, there, and more white people there. All of this is being just watched and then you go and redraw the district lines accordingly. But what happens is the district lines have been drawn, in most cases, by politicians. So they would draw the district line in a way to predict their job. So the Democrats would draw the district lines so that all the Democrats are in what area. All you have to do there is just be way to the left and you will win the domination from the Democrats. The Republicans will close in and block in their district, so it's a Republican district. All you have to do there is be way to the right, and then you win your district. Now, imagine when the Democrats and the Republicans get on now to Sacramento or wherever capital it And one is way to the right, one is way to the left.

[01:08:47.960] - Speaker 1
Nothing gets done. Now, the idea is, how do we go and get them closer together so that they can work together? The way the districts are drawn, you can't do that. What I said was this, Well, wait a minute, that we are having a fixed system here. I know I have to do anything. You always get reelected, you have a job security, but the mean of nothing is getting done. They said, Yeah, I absolutely like. I said, Well, we're going to change that. We're going to go and have the districts drawn by ordinary folks that are experts in maps, but not by politicians. Well, you can't do that. Democrats and Republicans are like, Well, it really mattered. They said, How could you start tackling this problem? This is not the problem. We It's all I love it, and this blah, blah, blah. Anyway, I put it on a ballot, an initiative on the ballot, if the people both. Twice, we lost because we couldn't really explain to ordinary folks what redistricting is about. And the cherimandling, it's about those. But some people were saying, Why did he give up? It's never going to happen. Why did he give up?

[01:09:54.390] - Speaker 1
It's not going to work in all this stuff. But sure enough, in 2008, we won. Then two years later, we were also primers. So now, both of those things are now won. California now carved itself out as being unique. It was one of the first states that created its own independent redistricting commission to draw the district lines and take that responsibility away from the politicians. So now the politicians went nuts because of that. But it now created fear districts and now it became the model for rest of the country. So now one-third of the districts in America are already drawn by independent commissions. So there's still a lot of work needs to be done because this is a 200-year-old villain in America. It is totally a fixed system and where people sometimes have 70% of certain votes, but they get only 30% of representation through the Congressional seats. I mean, it's just a terrible, terrible system We fixed it in California, and I'm promoting it all over the country that they should fix it and to have independent redistributing commissions. There's certain things like this, but it's because of my naivety. I saw that and I found that you can think that if you have to do something about it, we shouldn't take that lying down and say, That's the way it always was.

[01:11:21.400] - Speaker 1
That's the way they meant to do it 200 years ago, and therefore, we should go along with it. I felt being an outsider No, this is unacceptable. We got to do something about it. This just gives you one example. There's many other examples. For instance, when you are a little bit more naive about things, you just, in general, don't accept the status quo.

[01:11:43.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you don't know what's impossible Exactly.

[01:11:46.360] - Speaker 1
That's right. When I, for instance, in California, they always said, When we have an emergency, we are not really prepared. I said, Well, if this is inexcusable, we will be prepared. We go and we started practicing and We're preparing ourselves, which drove everyone nuts, but I did it because I want to make sure that if you have an earthquake, we are prepared. Do we really know what the procedure is if there's an earthquake and everything is coming down? All of our infrastructure always. What is the procedure? Where do we go? How do we communicate in all those things? What hospitals will be available? How would the hospitals increase in the amount of bed size? The amount of beds that they have, the amount of rooms they have, surgery rooms that they have, all this stuff. We worked all that stuff. To me, I think it is very, very important that we step outside and take a different approach rather than just accepting the status quo. To me, that was always an advantage. In bodybuilding, also looked at bodybuilding differently, not to look at it the same way as everyone else did. In weight lifting, it was the same way.

[01:12:50.670] - Speaker 1
In acting, it was the same way. The first one that really said to Universal Studio, You guys are crazy to just promote the movies in three countries, in Japan, in Germany, and in America. I said, It's insane. You should go to 10, 20 different countries and promote the movie and start increasing the popularity of movies in these other countries. And they said, No, no, you're crazy. Well, I went with Conan the Barbarian to 50 different countries. They were successful in these 15 different countries. Now, of course, they're sending the actors all over the world because now, finally, they realize that the world is a marketplace place. It's not just America and Germany and Japan, but they have the whole world. If it's the Middle East, if it's African countries, maybe there's less money coming from these places on like South America. But let's go and promote the movie in every country, in every continent all over the world. So there's that like having a fresh mind and being an outsider. You look at things different.

[01:13:52.840] - Speaker 2
Considering you married into the most important Democrat family in the history of the country, how did choose to run as a Republican?

[01:14:01.440] - Speaker 1
Well, I was a Republican from the time I came to America, 1968. So when I listened to Hubert Humphrey, who was running for President in 1968, and then I listened to Richard Nixon. So there was I know two ways about that in my mind, coming from a socialist country that I was more with Nixon. So I felt like when Humphrey talked, it was like being back in Austria. That's not what I want. I want something different. And so I That became naturally because of Nixon, a Republican, and it was clearly a Nixon Republican, which means that he was open-minded because Nixon was a Republican, but he also was seeking for universal health care. He was also starting out the EPA in Washington, the Environmental Protection Agency. So he was in the environment, protecting the environment. He was also fighting the pollution It was a lot of things that he had in a genius in foreign policy, especially with his sidekick, Henry Kissinger, who was also very smart. So all of this, this was known to Maria when I went out with her in the beginning. Also her father, I always said it on the dinner table, I'm a Nixon fan.

[01:15:26.290] - Speaker 1
Of course, in the later '70s, that was not It's a good thing to say because now we have gone through Watergate and we have gone through... And Sargent Schraub, her father, ran against Nixon because he was the vice presidential candidate with McGovern. Sargent Schraub, I said, I love Nixon. He always done coughing. He's a crook. He's a crook in and all that stuff, which I totally understood that that's his point of view because they were and they were responsible for breaking into the national headquarters of the Democratic Party and all that stuff. They were major, major mistakes made. The bottom line is policy-wise, I always admired him and thought it was great. So I modeled myself after that. But that didn't mean that I closed my mind to the democratic way of thinking. So when I listened to conversations at the Shriver house or at the Kennedy house, wherever we were, I thought that were really profound and very interesting ways of approaching problems. What I loved about the family was that they always talked about solving problems, solving issues. I just got so excited about it. It was like in the early days when someone talked to me about fitness and about weight training, this was a new world that I'm always had in picking up all this information, I'm learning things that they never even thought of, and all of a sudden, I'm thinking about it.

[01:17:02.370] - Speaker 1
It was really great that I was learning from them, getting motivated and inspired by them and about policy. Then later on, that actually had an effect on me that I wanted to run for governor, but I never changed party because of that. And I just thought, They have good ideas. I have good ideas. Republicans have good ideas. The trick of it is for us to work together. Democrats and Republicans have to work together to utilize 100% of our brainpower rather than just 50% of the brainpower.

[01:17:34.130] - Speaker 2
And get the job done, not just be stuck, not just be stuck. That's right.

[01:17:37.910] - Speaker 1
It's all about getting the job done.

[01:17:39.580] - Speaker 2
That's right. Amazing. Of the three different work lives you've had, which would you say was the most difficult?

[01:17:45.490] - Speaker 1
I don't think I could put a thing on any of them because I think that bodybuilding was extremely difficult. You had to work yourself to become a champion and to stay in there for a long time and all that stuff. It was really It was really tough. The same was with show business and the amount of injuries that you get and stunts in show business and the dangers that you face, that you can be one day up high and have a movie that comes out, it goes through the roof in the box office. The next day, you come out of the movie and it goes in the toilet. Then all of a sudden, you're nobody. You're always as good as the last movie. That's always been tough. Then, of course, I have to say that the biggest responsibility is being governed because when you do movies, it's not the end of the world if a movie sucks and it goes in the toilet. It's just that people would say, Okay, that movie was not that good. But then when it's government, you serve 40 million people. That is a huge responsibility. And now you really have to connect and find out what is it that the people want.

[01:18:56.380] - Speaker 1
It's like John F. Kennedy said, let's not seek the Republican an answer to a problem or the democratic answer to a problem. Let's seek the right answer and the right solution. And this is, I think, the big challenge that you have at all times to find the right solution for the problems And those problems change all the time. So we have to recognize that also. But so I think the responsibility-wise, it's the biggest responsibility with being governor and also the most pleasurable. To me, I got the most satisfaction out of serving the people. There's nothing like it than to serve the people of California. And also there's a rippling effect that you help people all over America. Like with our mental issues and good government practice, there's a rippling effect all over the world. We have had an impact worldwide. But I was very fortunate to have three careers, to have learned from all three careers that I talk about in my book, Be Useful. Now I'm combining all of those three talents into one so that I can use all of those three talents and move forward and make it just a better world, make people more fit, motivate people, make them more successful, and do my TV series, FUBBA and other TV shows and the movies and stuff like that, and continue with my after-school programs.

[01:20:21.830] - Speaker 1
I'm having really a great time doing all my different careers.

[01:20:26.350] - Speaker 2
Thank you so much for doing this. I feel like I could talk to you forever. Thank you so much for sharing the wisdom of your incredible life, and look forward to seeing you soon.

[01:20:35.450] - Speaker 1
Okay, you got it. Thank you very much, and good luck with everything.
