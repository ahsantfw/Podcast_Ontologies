[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 4
The last time we spoke, this was way before the New Blue Sun album.

[00:00:26.690] - Speaker 1
Before we even recorded that album, it's almost like That was a different person, almost. Same person, but you know. I understand. I was just in a whole different head space. I understand. Yeah, a lot has happened since then, man. Exploring Making music as always.

[00:00:48.280] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the hunt for flutes around the world, what you found.

[00:00:53.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Flutes is like anything else. You collect music instruments as well. It's like once you find your end, the thing that tracks you first, you want to know more about that instrument or things like it. So once I started playing indigenous flutes, that got me into a whole another play on all kinds of flutes from different cultures, from Bonsuri Indian flutes to Japanese flutes to Korean flutes, African flutes, just anything that had holes in it that I could manipulate. I just wanted to hear it. And so I went on just a binge of finding and collecting and seeing which ones I responded to. And when we went on tour, I would... At this point, I got, I don't know, 75, 80 flutes, and I haven't really counted them all. But when it's time to go on tour, you can't take all of them. So you have to decide which ones are going to be your favorites at that moment. And it really depends on the vibe you're in. Sometimes certain flutes are speaking to you at a certain time, and you're in this zone for a minute, and then you may move to another zone.

[00:02:09.010] - Speaker 1
But yeah, man, I've just collected buying flutes. And everywhere, like every city, we went to, we made it a thing to hunt. So we went to vintage shops, a lot of different flea markets and used instrument places. So we would pick up all kinds of instruments And in true form, we may play them that night, being amateurs at them, just to see what we get from first responses. First, your kid playing with it before you study it or get better in a certain way because you'll never get that time back again.

[00:02:51.400] - Speaker 2
It's purely instinctual at that time. You don't know how it works yet.

[00:02:56.500] - Speaker 1
But you do a thing that I value a I call it a gear that people overlook. It's the amateur gear. I think people overlook it to get to experience and well-trained, which is awesome. But you'll never be able to get the first responses back. So I cherish those, man. Even on the album, New Blue Sun, the beginning track, it's an instrument. I'm playing this electronic wind instrument, and I actually took it out of the box maybe 20 minutes before we started recording. So what you hear is me figuring out the latency, figuring out what I can get out of it. It was a stock oboe I like this sound. I was like, Whoa, I like this sound, and started playing the melody, and that's what came.

[00:03:50.810] - Speaker 2
What's an electronic wind instrument?

[00:03:52.780] - Speaker 1
It's like a flute, but it's-Do you blow into it or no? You blow into it. It's your amateur, the pressure of your lips, the pressure of the wind, it's all calculated and then sent through whatever computer, and it's very responsive. It's awesome. It opened a whole new door because when we went to record at that session, I had all my wooden flutes, and in my mind, I'm like, Yeah, okay, we're doing this wooden flute situation. I just took this, and that completely just opened a whole other door that you can hook it up to anything and play anything. It's almost like a MIDI instrument, too.

[00:04:32.080] - Speaker 2
That's what I was going to say. A piano is an acoustic, physical instrument. But you can play a keyboard that you play like a piano, but it can trigger sounds, any sound.

[00:04:42.950] - Speaker 1
Same way. That's exactly what it is, but it's wind-controlled.

[00:04:46.370] - Speaker 2
But you blow into it.

[00:04:47.910] - Speaker 1
It's wind-controlled. The pressure of your wind, even on a true woodwind instrument, your embouture, if you bite down on the reed, it'll sometimes bend the note and You can go into the app and fix how much pressure you want, how responsive it is, how much fight, win, fight back you want. So that opened up a whole new door on the album. And it's just even since Man, like touring, it opened up a whole new sound palette that I could just play anything.

[00:05:20.170] - Speaker 2
So is the thing that makes a flute a flute is that it's a tube with holes in it?

[00:05:25.150] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:05:25.400] - Speaker 2
Because a saxophone is a tube with holes, but it has more to It's got more mechanics. Yeah. And a clarinet has more mechanics.

[00:05:33.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I would say, you're probably right. The basis of a flute is some cylinder with holes in it that they're evenly spaced out to get Sometimes not even evenly spaced out. Back in the day when they first started making flutes, they didn't have measuring equipment in that way. So they were just going on what they heard over time. The distance between the holes and even the width of the hole makes sharp, flat.

[00:06:04.090] - Speaker 2
How different, when you pick up a different instrument, flute, how different are they from each other?

[00:06:10.210] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. They're like people. Even if you have the same flute maker Same key, same length of wood, it's going to sound different, especially when you're dealing with handmade instruments in wood. There's just so much... The wood is a real responsive thing. Even the same flute made of two different woods, same key will sound different. I'm sure guitar players can tell you the same thing. You can get five different Fender strats, and they all going to sound different, even if it's made in the same factory. Yeah, it's just inherent.

[00:06:50.630] - Speaker 2
But that's the magic of it, though. The difference in the way it sounds will inspire you to play it differently? Yes.

[00:06:58.750] - Speaker 1
My very first flute that I got from Guillermo, it's in the key of E. And over time, I play it, and I didn't know that you're supposed to clean it out. After you play every time. So for years, I've just never cleaned it. So it would hold... I mean, I'm a bit too graphic, but all the moisture from my mouth, it would almost create a coating in the cylinder of the flute. And to me, it It gave it a certain character because once I went back to get it cleaned out, it was a completely different flute. And it was a sad day for me, too, because it had gained a soul. It really sounded like a mature woman that had lived. And then after I got it cleaned out, it just sounded like a new young person, and I was unfamiliar with this thing, and it was like, Oh.

[00:07:56.920] - Speaker 2
So since then, have you not cleaned it?

[00:07:59.050] - Speaker 1
No, I don't. I don't. Or I just expect that it's going to be this way and I clean it. But I like it to have something built in. Even if it's tuned out a little bit, I like it. I don't know. It just sometimes it's an actual coating because you're coating the cylinder with human stuff.

[00:08:20.660] - Speaker 2
And it's your stuff, too. It's personal. It certainly personalizes it. Tell me the story of getting the first flute. How How did that happen? Were you looking for a flute?

[00:08:32.700] - Speaker 1
Actually, let me even go back because we were just sitting here talking about California. When I moved out here, I knew nothing about Venice. I knew nothing about the West Side. And so this real estate agent, we had been looking for almost a week for a place. And I was only supposed to be for six months, just regrouping. And I was looking for a rental spot in LA proper, inside the city. And we looked at a few places, and And a lot of them really spoke to me in a way. And on a whim, the agent said, Well, I got this one little spot, this little bitty house in Venice. And so I was like, All right. I told my friends, I might be checking out Venice. And they were like, No, no. Don't move to Venice because if you move to the West Side, we'll never see you. And it's true because once you're over here, you don't need to go back on the other side. Everything is here.

[00:09:26.740] - Speaker 2
It's so much nicer on the West Side.

[00:09:28.490] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's actually cooler. It's cooler on the west side. The beach air makes it cool. In the summertime, when it's hot, it can be 100 degrees inside the city. It'll be like 85 here. So I liked it in that way. When I got to Venice, man, it's like, I do believe sometimes we are put in places to meet who we need to meet and the people we need to meet at a certain time. I happened to just be gone. I met this girl at this breathwork class.

[00:09:57.790] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the breathwork class. What type was it?

[00:10:00.830] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was you doing this holotropic breathing, where for an hour, you're doing this intense rhythmic breathing, where you get in a trance in a way. And this young lady invited me to the class. And so I went to the class And then after the class, because you're laying on the mat while you're doing it, you're laying on your back on the mat while you're doing it. And after the class, while the class is sitting there, some people started setting up instruments. And so the teacher's like, Hey, if you want to stay, we have of these performers. So Farmer Dave and Cascia were playing. They were just setting up. And I didn't know who they were. I didn't know Cascia from a Can of Paint. And they were setting up guitars and made a flute. And Cascia starts playing this wooden flute. And I'm laying on my back and I'm like, Man, what is this? Man, I've never heard this sound in my life. Like, whoa, what is this sound? And I had to go up to her after the class and I was like, What's that? What are you playing? And she said, Yes, it's this indigenous flute.

[00:11:02.450] - Speaker 1
She said, That's God Guillermo, Martínez. He made it for me. And I said, Can you pass me Guillermo's info? And she gave me Guillermo's number and I reached out to him, told him I wanted a flute. I went on his site, just picked the key. I didn't know. Just picked the key and put in an order. And yeah, he made my first flute. And from the first day I got it, I went to pick the flute up, and I had to drive out to Modusca, Canyon. Wait, that was about an hour outside of LA. And so this is where his workshop is, where he makes the flutes. And I go to pick it up and I'm thinking, Yeah, I'm just going to pay for this flute and be on my way. And so I grabbed the flute and we do all what we need to do. And he says, Okay, so let me just take you outside real quick. And he takes me out in front of the barn, and then he lights up a smudge stick, and he turns me in one direction. He smudges me. He turns me in another direction. He smudges me.

[00:12:02.580] - Speaker 1
He smudges the flute. And so I'm like, Whoa, okay, this is a thing. And then he told me the history of flute playing, Native American flute playing. Yeah, he took me through there. And after then, I took it home. And from the first day I got it, I just never stopped playing it. I would walk and play. I love to walk. So I would walk five, six miles in back home playing. And it just became an everyday thing. And I would find patterns I loved. I would find made-up melodies. I didn't take a... I don't know if it's even a lesson. I mean, I'm sure someone can teach it now. You can probably find it on TikTok or something. But I didn't take any lessons. I just picked it up. And the learning curve on these flutes are not that hard at all. It's basically, it's like a recorder in a way because you're blowing through a hole and you're manipulating the notes by however many fingers you have up or down. And you can bend the notes. You learn these things after playing with it for a a while. You can half a note, you could slide it into a note.

[00:13:05.090] - Speaker 1
And all these things just became interesting to me because I was always into jazz music, classical music. And some of the best parts of some of my best composers were when they started playing the piccolo or flute parts or oboe parts. So I was always into wind instruments or woodwind instruments. Even before I got into the flute, I was playing bass clarinet. And then I got an oboe later on, which is the hardest instrument to play in the world. So, yeah, once I started it, I just ain't ever put it down.

[00:13:40.590] - Speaker 2
How was developing the wind to play? Do you run out of breath?

[00:13:44.090] - Speaker 1
Yes, you do. When I do run out of breath, but I think because I walk a lot, I would play while I'm walking. So it almost trained me to be out of breath in a way. So my win was up. And I think because I'm a rapper, my win was up to start with.

[00:13:59.430] - Speaker 2
Do you still Don't you think of yourself as a rapper?

[00:14:01.650] - Speaker 1
I don't really. That's what's crazy.

[00:14:03.480] - Speaker 2
Because you just said that.

[00:14:04.240] - Speaker 1
I was like, really? You're a rapper? Yeah, I know. It's weird, man. I wish I was more of a rapper right now.

[00:14:13.430] - Speaker 2
It's another life.

[00:14:14.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It is. It's funny when you ask me that because I have thoughts all the time, and sometimes rap start as just thoughts. And so I always write them down and I always rhyme things. I still rhyme, but it's not like a It's not like an everyday practice. I don't know. I don't have a connection with it like I used to, but I would like to. I keep trying because there's a challenge that I'm trying to do with myself. I want to see, Well, what can I make that sounds authentic for me right now. And I'm influenced by everything. So I listen to new kids, old kids. So I always try to figure out what can I do now at this age. I'll be 50 in May Hey. And it's even weird for me to even say you're 50. I do not feel 50 at all. But when I look in the mirror and I see all this silver hair, I'm like, Yeah, nigga, you're 50. You're 50. If I never knew my age, I probably would think I'm 38 in the heart and spirit, 38, 40 maybe, which ain't that far from 50.

[00:15:23.780] - Speaker 2
It's different, though.

[00:15:24.730] - Speaker 1
It is totally different.

[00:15:26.300] - Speaker 2
Psychologically different.

[00:15:27.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It take you a little minute to To get up. I have to adjust my back when I get up. Which aging, I always say, is hilarious to me. Aging is hilarious and cruel at the exact same time. It's hilarious because all the things that you used to be able to do, it's harder to do those things. The regular things. Yes, the regular things. It's cruel because you know that mortality is happening. You You know what's happening. It's not like a mystery of what's happening. I wouldn't want to go back to being a younger age, though, which is weird. Another weird thing. Someone would say, Yeah, you can go back to being 25. I would not.

[00:16:12.180] - Speaker 2
No. No. I don't think I ever asked you about your parents. Tell me about your parents.

[00:16:18.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah, my mom and my dad, they passed away young, both with heart trouble. My mom had a heart attack in her sleep. My father, he had a valve in his heart that it just stopped working. So both of them, they checked out young.

[00:16:36.220] - Speaker 2
How was your relationship with them?

[00:16:38.220] - Speaker 1
Me and my mom, we were tight. I grew up with my mom. My mom and dad were never married, so I would see my dad a lot, but it's a different thing when you're not in the house. So me and my dad were really cool. He was one of just the coolest, kindest people that I know. But we weren't that close. Yeah, we just weren't.

[00:17:02.850] - Speaker 2
Did you feel a connection, though?

[00:17:04.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah, for sure. I think around 14, my mom sent me to live with my dad. And so, of course, that was a lot better. So I got to be around him more. But then we started making music at 17, so that's three, four years, and I'm out. We travel around the world at that point, so I only had a little time with my dad.

[00:17:27.870] - Speaker 2
What was your mom's musical taste like, and what was your dad's musical taste like?

[00:17:32.400] - Speaker 1
Mom was a top 40 girl, so she was singing like Supremes, Donna Ross songs, Regina Bell, Anita Baker. She was an R&B kid. Good taste.

[00:17:48.150] - Speaker 2
Listen to the radio or would she play records or cassettes?

[00:17:51.680] - Speaker 1
Listen to the radio. She had some records around. But mostly radio. Our time we spent was in the car a lot. So we listened to her a lot in the car. My dad was on the funk side. My dad played a lot of hard co-funk, Gap Band, Parliament Funkadelec. But even further back, he was Tentation to Four Tops type of person.

[00:18:14.930] - Speaker 2
Did they both love music?

[00:18:16.680] - Speaker 1
Yes, but my mom was more on the gospel side, too, because my mom and I, we went to church a lot.

[00:18:23.230] - Speaker 2
Every week?

[00:18:24.050] - Speaker 1
Every week, three times a week Bible study. Wow.

[00:18:27.540] - Speaker 2
Would you ever sing in church?

[00:18:29.210] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I was in the Vacation Bible School, Bible study, all that stuff. So my mama kept me in the church. So a lot of the music we were listening to was very old-style gospel music. And I really love Reverend C. J. Johnson stuff, where it was just people clapping and feet stomping and moaning and singing gospel. But I did some contemporary gospel of that time, like the Clark sisters were big for me. They're amazing.

[00:19:01.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah, man. Can you play me an example of C. J. Johnson?

[00:19:04.630] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:19:05.780] - Speaker 2
I don't know this.

[00:19:06.720] - Speaker 1
Yeah, man. I love this music. Me, too. See, my grandfather was a preacher, too. And so we had a little church. And most Southern people that went to little churches, they'll know it's a certain church when they pull out an old chair and sit it in the middle of the pew and people get down and testify or they pray on that old chair. And it's a certain church. And my grandfather had one of those churches. He was one of the preachers that grab his ear and... He was one of those people. I always thought it was mesmerizing to watch him do it. So I'm from that. I like the foot-stomping, Holy Ghost church. I recorded this from my mom's cassette, actually. So I I'm not actually sure if this is C. J. Johnson, but this is the type because I don't have the artist's name. It may be C. J. Johnson, but you'll get the feel. And this song is called You Better Run to the City.

[00:20:15.650] - Speaker 3
Oh, you better run, better run, better run. You better.

[00:20:22.800] - Speaker 4
You better run, better run, better run.

[00:20:25.790] - Speaker 3
You better run, better run, better run.

[00:20:28.490] - Speaker 4
You better run, to the sky of your head. You better run.

[00:20:32.760] - Speaker 3
Well, not part of those who says, Don't you remember them. Can't he? Faced along, he placed along? He both hearts and they understand that the man may say, Hold his mind and say, The moment you're leaving, I'm only going to believe in that. Turn it behind, I thought that you'd better run.

[00:20:52.990] - Speaker 4
Run, run, run.

[00:20:54.970] - Speaker 3
You better run, better run, better run.

[00:20:58.310] - Speaker 4
Come on.

[00:20:59.420] - Speaker 3
You better run, you see your face. You better run. But if you don't believe that that's the thing in your life, you cannot take a profile. Read it tonight. You can read it. Then you will understand that that you can never keep what was the holiest anger. He lived nine hundred times, six, nine, 10, and was dying for the heavy man. Good new time, the boy, you better run. You better run, get a run, get a run, get a run. You better run. You better run. You better run. You You better mind. But once a man comes to find his scene, well, Nicodemus said, Rule of the Jews, he came to Jesus, he came by night, he said, I want to be born into the heavenly side, then I broke to Nicodemus, and I have the friends that I now want to get to heaven, and I keep on the then, oh, well, You better run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run He's taken in place and had joints in way, but they're finding a battle. He prayed until the Lord to stop the sound. Can you stop the sound? Can you count the war?

[00:22:59.670] - Speaker 3
He got away for that, the foot of the hill. He said, I want to be born into the heavenly side. Then I woke to Nicodemus, and I had some friends that I now want to get to heaven, and I keep on to them. Oh well, Nicodemus can understand how could a man be born when he was so old, I thought, Are you ready? Run, run, run, run, run, He said, I'll find you a man, then let your just stand still on that, you better run. Run, run, run. You better.

[00:23:13.910] - Speaker 4
You better run, you better run.

[00:23:16.740] - Speaker 3
You better run, you better run. You better run. Well, you've been up on Sam Sunday from his birth. He's the longest man that ever lived on ever one day. You Sam Sunday walking along, oh, where Samson's drinker was. Never found out. But he, you came and sat on his knees, said, He's telling me where your drinker might be. He told him to drink a lot in the half. You did shame my head just as I clean as my hand. My sprinkle will become as a natural man. I thought that you better run. You better run, run, run, run, run They call this the Holy Ghost Dance. Come on. Adam run the person, and that ain't all. Adam run the person, and broke up the law. Well, Adam run the member of the human race. He disobeyed God, and he drove him from his place. You read on down to about the Chapter 9, the where Mount King Jesus turned water to wind up. But you better run. Run, run, run. You better run, you better run, you better run, you You better run to see your way. You better run.

[00:25:13.730] - Speaker 1
That's unbelievable. Oh, man. Like that clapping? That beat?

[00:25:19.470] - Speaker 2
Crazy.

[00:25:20.450] - Speaker 1
Man, oh, my God.

[00:25:22.090] - Speaker 2
There's no artifice.

[00:25:24.230] - Speaker 1
There's no performance. Well, you can tell he almost freestyled. You can tell he making... He almost He's spewing what he knows of the Bible out as rap verses, almost. You can tell there's no... He didn't even count his bars. Sometimes they have. You can tell he's just free. It's awesome, man. I love it. To me, that clapping, though.

[00:25:48.240] - Speaker 2
That's pure. Very. That's pure.

[00:25:51.370] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:25:51.630] - Speaker 2
So two things come in mind when I hear that, and what you've been saying is that, one, from a young age, you got to experience a music that isn't showbiz. That's not showbiz what we were hearing. That was a deep connection to something.

[00:26:09.650] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think my mom kept me in the church in that way around, so I got that spirit look inside or what it looks like or how it affect people. I got to see what that looked like. But at the same time, my mom was the first person that took me to a Fresh Fest concert. So I saw LL, I saw Public enemy. I saw Houdini all on the same ticket. That was my first rap concert. I was blown away seeing the radio, seeing S1Ws do this military thing. Performance, yeah. Houdini, they were like, phone They had these leather shorts and leather hats on. I was like, Man, they are killing it. So I saw both sides. We were in the time of Michael Jackson and Prince and New Edition and all that stuff, and Guy and Isaac Brothers and all that stuff. I got both sides. Mtv was huge. I saw the entertainment, pure entertainment part, too.

[00:27:08.610] - Speaker 2
Also, the fact that the first time you hear the flute is after doing holotropic breathing. And holotropic breathing is a psychedelic experience. It will leave you in an altered state. So you're in this altered state and you hear this sound. If you had not done the breathing, maybe the flute wouldn't have spoke to you in the same way.

[00:27:29.020] - Speaker 1
Maybe because you stayed there to rest up or just chill out for a minute. I could have got up and left and just missed the whole thing.

[00:27:37.480] - Speaker 2
But it feels related.

[00:27:39.050] - Speaker 1
They feel related. I know it's related. I mean, even me, that one little house in Venice, all of it is related. It's funny because I had a trip planned to go to Hawaii, actually, to sit and do ayahuasca. I got my flute done. My flute came right in time before that trip. So I took my flute on the trip as well. I think all of that plays into me getting to that place.

[00:28:07.570] - Speaker 2
Was that the first time you took ayahuasca?

[00:28:09.310] - Speaker 1
Yeah, very first time.

[00:28:11.100] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that experience.

[00:28:13.010] - Speaker 1
That's where I can describe it as a Just a connecting place where... I mean, you've always heard that, Yeah, we're all connected, and I'm connected to this. I'm connected to you. But that was the first time you feel it, and you know that you're part of just a big energy orchestra more than anything. We all have our own body instruments that look different, but we're all of a one thing. And you could see it from-Not visually, but I could feel it. Feel it. I didn't get much, many visuals from it.

[00:28:48.660] - Speaker 2
Would you say you could feel it in a way that you didn't question it, like it was clear?

[00:28:52.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, totally. It just totally makes sense when you think about it. And an extreme love and an acceptance of people that you may have thought were horrible. It quickly made you realize that they were really trying to do the best. They made bad choices. But they were doing their best. Yeah, they were doing the best with what they could at that time. So you don't hold it too strong and you're like, Mmm. And that was the first time that I've ever felt it in that way. Even there's a song on the album called That Night in Hawaii, blah, Blah, blah, blah. But that was actually a real occurrence. There was a point where I started doing this thing called Tony, and I didn't understand. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. But it's like your body is an instrument at that point, and you're basically... I know it's going to sound cookey, but your body is an instrument and you're getting played. And so I know I was not making these notes because I didn't I was not in my mind frame to even think of notes. I was doing this... And then it would alternate.

[00:30:10.480] - Speaker 4
It was going...

[00:30:14.020] - Speaker 1
It was playing me like some type of instrument.

[00:30:20.960] - Speaker 2
You were not trying to change the notes?

[00:30:23.060] - Speaker 1
No. I had more breath because in my mind, as it's happening, I'm listening. It's funny. The human part of me is like, damn, I wish I had my phone. That's the first thing I thought I wanted to record it. Of course. But I'm listening to myself make these noises, and at a certain point, I'm like, whoa, I'm still going. I don't have that much breath. And then I'll go, and do it again. And it's not me. It's weird. Now, I asked the shaman about it. It's like, yeah, this is a thing called toning. It's for something inside you or someone close to you. It's basically like vibrating to move a thing. So it's almost like a shockwave therapy in a way. But you're the shockwave. You're the energy center that's making it go. It was a trip, man. It felt like a panther. And that's the song on the album. I was trying to find a way to mimic it.

[00:31:26.450] - Speaker 2
So you start telling the story about the house in Venice. Did you end up moving to the house Venice?

[00:31:30.550] - Speaker 1
Yes. I ended up moving to the house in Venice. It was only supposed to be there for six months. And then I kept renewing another six months, another six months.

[00:31:39.240] - Speaker 2
Just because life was good there, you felt at home, would you say?

[00:31:42.970] - Speaker 1
It felt where I needed to be. It was a very small house. Actually, in the film, I recently released a film called Moving Day, and I actually documented that time. But it just felt nice to be in this small house. I like smaller places. Even in Atlanta, I had a huge five-room bedroom house, and I would stay in this one little room. It was almost like I had posters all over the wall. I just like smaller places, and it felt great for me to be there. And I ended up meeting Carlos Ninho at Airwarn. And when I met Carlos, it's funny. I was actually talking to Mike D. We were in line, checking out, talking to Mike D. And Carlos comes up and he invites us to this event that he's doing that night. And he said, Carlos was like, Yeah, man, people were telling me that you were around town playing your flute and that we should meet. And I knew one day I would meet you. I didn't know where would be your when. And I just felt this was the time. I got this event happening tonight. You should come by. You should bring your flute.

[00:32:50.730] - Speaker 1
So I'm game because he said it's an Alice Coltrane event. And so I was like, Oh, nice. All right. And the crazy thing, I was listening to Alice that whole week before I met him.

[00:33:02.680] - Speaker 2
Isn't it amazing how it all just comes together?

[00:33:07.160] - Speaker 1
It orchestrated how it's supposed to be. It's happened like that all my life. Me too. It's amazing. We're Big Boi, we're Dunja, everything. It's always been- It just happens. That way. As long as you're in a place where you are accepting those things, too.

[00:33:23.410] - Speaker 2
Your realtor could have said, Well, there's this place in Venice. You're like, No, I'm not looking for Venice. But you were open. You It wasn't what you were looking for.

[00:33:31.560] - Speaker 1
No, but it was what I needed.

[00:33:32.370] - Speaker 2
But it was exactly what you needed. Exactly. Yeah.

[00:33:34.760] - Speaker 1
Exactly. After that, I went to the event, and Siri brought her for a senior keyboard player. He was playing that night with Carlos, and Seria's mom was on stage, and Siri's mom invited me to come up and play. Now, Siri, he was raised on the ashron with Alice back in the day. So his mom knew Alice. They were in that world. So she had the heart. And so she had the instinct to invite me up to play. And at that point, I'd never played with anybody. I've always just been walking around playing. How many years have you been playing at this point? Maybe two, three years. Minds your mind, my flute is tuned to 432 hertz. I'm not a big music nerd buff, but I knew that 432 was on to 440, and most people are playing at 440. Yeah. And so when they invited me up, I was like, No, I don't think I'll come. And then I felt like it would have been a spectacle. It was like, Oh, Andre 3000 is playing. I know if people want to put their phones up and record me in this place. So I felt that that wasn't the place for me to jump on stage and play.

[00:34:47.790] - Speaker 1
The whole night, though, as they're playing, I'm in the backpack and I'm playing to myself while they're playing. And then after the whole event was, oh, I stayed to the very end. And then Carlos comes after the event. He was like, Yeah, man, if you ever want to get together and jam, man, come to my house. And so we went to Carlos' house, and I had first sessions in this garage studio, and we actually recorded that session, and we're going to put it out, which is so interesting to hear the playing from that to the new Blue Sun, which is so crazy. But yeah, it's like those breadcrumbs just happened, and we just kept rocking. And I told Carlos, I was like, Hey, man, I want to find a way to present this wind playing in a broader way. Because at that point, people had started filming me at Starbucks or in the airport. Like, oh, it's easy carrying this flute around. So it was like a Where's Waldo with his flute thing. And they would always catch me mid-phrase or something, and it was like, Oh, man, I wish they would have caught it when it was jamming.

[00:35:56.500] - Speaker 1
So I was like, I'd like to present this in a broader way to the public. So I like to record some type of album. And so Carlos was like, Yeah, I know people that can make it happen. And so we would try out different things to see what works, different players. And then we ended up landing on the four or five people that were the core band on the album.

[00:36:23.320] - Speaker 2
Tell me some of the things you tried along the way before you got to where you wanted it to be. What were some the experiments leading up to it?

[00:36:31.630] - Speaker 1
Well, it's always funny. The idea you have in your mind of who you think you're going to be or the music you're going to be, sometimes it's a little off from what it's going to be, which is cool, though, because you sometimes get to a greater thing. In my mind, I wanted to do this fully rhythmic, Steve Rykish trance. And it's still possible. But at that time, I was like, this rhythmic, really constructive thing that you can blend and mix with other... You could blend it with beats if you wanted to. What started to happen was I recorded a few of those and I liked it, but it just wasn't what I thought it would be. We just started doing a free form. Carlos Ninho, he's been recording in this way for a long time, volumes involved in music. I think me meeting him was a good, the best place that I could be to to open to play. Because really, the community is we get together, we have an intention, but not a strong, we're going to do this, we're going to do this. It's an intention just to make music. Not knowing what it's going to...

[00:37:45.840] - Speaker 1
Not calling out keys, not calling nothing. We go purely free form, and that's how the album was created. And it gave me a chance to just play. I'm not a great player, but it gave me a chance to express something and find key moments, and we took it out and played. We toured all of last year, fully freeform. When we hit the stage, we never knew what it would be, which is an awesome, exciting, scary, powerful place to be on stage when there's people that come to see it.

[00:38:24.810] - Speaker 2
How different was the music from night to night?

[00:38:27.770] - Speaker 1
Very different, depending on the mood. Sometimes, depending on the venue, depending on how we feel as a group, as a unit before we go on. Sometimes, there was one time where I said, Hey, why don't we just start silent completely and just see how long we can be silent? And we held it for a long time and we just felt it and go. And it was something powerful. And we would end that way sometimes, too. But sometimes we were like, let's go 10. So as soon as we go, one, two, it was everything that you could throw. So it was like, yeah, just depending on the venue. Sometimes, if you're in a big cavernous space, you want to use the echo, so you play less. So you can hear it bounce back. But if you're in a tight space, you play more. We're playing festivals at this point, so we may go on like full sexual red or something. So when you're in a festival situation, you play louder because there's nothing bouncing back to you, which is an odd feeling But some great shows.

[00:39:31.470] - Speaker 2
And the audience isn't necessarily there to see you. So it's a different-Oh, yeah. For festivals, yeah. For a festival, it's a different feeling in the crowd.

[00:39:39.680] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. It was some real powerful moments, man. We did Tyler's Flockna. And these were like, these are young kids, man. And they came and they're seeing the best of pop music right now. And then we come out doing this freeform music. How they hear it? They were fucking with it. That's amazing. Yeah, they were like, mosh pitten. It was a trip, man. Because they only gave us 30 minutes. And so 30 minutes was up and they were like, No, we want more. The crowd was like, Let's go. So, yeah, you had great crowds. I mean, of course, not all of them are great. So we got some bad write-ups. One writer was like, He didn't even do Hey, Ya. We all laughed at that.

[00:40:29.930] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you weren't doing music for the critics. Not at all. You honestly weren't really even doing it for the audience. They got to see it.

[00:40:36.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah, they were going to want to see it. I would say this. It's not really a show, but we thank you all for coming. We're just- You're jamming. We're challenging. More than just... It's not really a jam either because they are jam bands. It was more of a conjuring thing. It's not like you just get a groove and you just go for a long time.

[00:40:56.780] - Speaker 2
When did you decide, I'm going to make an album?

[00:41:00.900] - Speaker 1
I can't remember the date, but it was after I played in the garage and me listening to a lot of records. I would send Carlos things I'm into. I would send him me playing to Indian rockers on a pool because Indian rockers are long, so I can just play on top of them. They usually stay in the same key, which is always good to play with these flutes in the key. They're not changing, so it was always good to I would send stuff like that, or I'd send a playlist of stuff that I'm into, then he would send cool stuff back. So we just got a mind frame of the type of music that I like, but then we threw it all out the window and recorded free. But I think Instincts and taste came into play.

[00:41:47.070] - Speaker 2
I'm sure the listening, even if it was different, informed the direction things went. For sure.

[00:41:53.240] - Speaker 1
I hear all the people I love and what I'm playing.

[00:41:56.360] - Speaker 2
Even if it sounds nothing like it.

[00:41:57.650] - Speaker 1
Yes, I hear. And I know, Oh, I I know I'm doing patterns right now. I know, Oh, that sounds cold training. So it's like, yeah, you feel it.

[00:42:08.830] - Speaker 2
How was the feeling when the album was being released versus your experience of putting out, let's call it popular music in the past, making this more esoteric music now? What was your feeling when you were putting it out?

[00:42:25.490] - Speaker 1
I was very excited, very excited. But one thing, I'm oblivious to the outside world a lot because one thing I failed to realize after I dropped it, the big thing was, Oh, man, we wait 17 years and this is what you give us? I was like, damn. Because for me, I never said Hey, people, wait for this rap out. I never said that. So for me, I was just putting out music. And we did intentionally. We went on a press run to let people know what this was before it came out. So if they didn't get the memo, I'm sorry, they didn't get the memo. Some people were like, Man, he didn't rap at all on it. But I said that there was no rapping, so I didn't know what else we could do.

[00:43:12.440] - Speaker 2
It's also not your problem, honestly. No, it's not. You're getting to make the thing you want to make.

[00:43:17.130] - Speaker 1
No, the job is sharing after we've recorded. Exactly. I feel that way. To me, at this point, we're just sharing it. Yeah, 100 %. If you like it or not, I'm cool. I'm totally fine with critique. I'm fine with people that are loving it, not liking it because I don't like everybody. Even people that I love artists, I don't like all the stuff they do. Of course. I'm totally fine with that, man. I just felt like it was a beautiful thing, and I wanted to share it. And I think for the times, too, It was really important to share it. And when you're in the street and people tell you for real how they feel about it, that's when you know. And that's what I loved about it. People were coming up telling us what they were doing with it. Or, yeah, I had this friend that was depressed that wasn't talking to us, and now they're coming. Or my friend is on this deathbed, only had two weeks to live, and he's listening to this. It was powerful in a whole another way that I didn't expect. I only knew, oh, man, I think this is beautiful, and we want to share it.

[00:44:16.110] - Speaker 1
That's all that matters.

[00:44:18.120] - Speaker 2
That's amazing. And now you're free to create anything you want because now going forward, there won't be any expectation.

[00:44:28.600] - Speaker 1
I think there'll always be some I feel like you're free. I know I'm free. But I think- I feel like I'm free to everybody else.

[00:44:36.290] - Speaker 2
You knocked the wall down, though.

[00:44:37.900] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. For sure.

[00:44:39.520] - Speaker 2
It's like it's a different... Like you said, you were a different person than you were when we sat here last.

[00:44:45.380] - Speaker 1
I totally feel like a different person.

[00:44:46.540] - Speaker 2
When we sat here last, you were playing flute, but you were not on I'm making an album. It was not like that. No. It was like you were finding a way to satisfy yourself making music again.

[00:45:01.360] - Speaker 1
Last time we spoke. I think it should always start that way. I think it should always start from a personal interest and just follow that interest. You never know where it's going to go. When I started rapping, I didn't know I would start producing. I didn't know I'd start making beats. I didn't know I'd start singing. I didn't know I'd start picking up interest. I didn't know. I'm just following what I'm into. And I think that's my only compass. That's all I got, really. My own interest.

[00:45:27.550] - Speaker 2
Do you still play flute wherever you go?

[00:45:29.770] - Speaker 1
That's No, I don't. And it's weird because people expect me to do it now or it's almost like a public performance. And so I almost have to hide away or find little caves or little alley ways to play. Because before, I just be playing, and they'll be like, Oh, this nigga playing the flute. But now it's a thing now. People expect it. And I don't like it as much for people to be expecting me or trying to film me do it.

[00:46:04.270] - Speaker 2
Because now, in a way, you're a professional flute player. As crazy as it sounds.

[00:46:12.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I guess you can say, yeah, I guess if you're getting paid for doing it, it's professional. Yeah. I'm a Sonic Explorer, man. That's what I am.

[00:46:20.360] - Speaker 2
How is performing instrumental music on stage different than other kinds of music?

[00:46:26.070] - Speaker 1
Different. Completely different. Even from how we record in the studio being on stage because there's another member in the band, and that's the audience. So we get Hoops and Hollas. We got people singing opera while we're doing it. We got people almost getting into fights while we're doing it. We got people in tears. We got people crying. So it's a whole another member going on. And I think when you have lights and you have a stage and you have people in front of you, they're expecting you to do a thing. And so I do think it charges you up differently than us just around jamming. So that was a totally different experience.

[00:47:08.130] - Speaker 2
Do you get nervous before a show?

[00:47:09.500] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Always. But I've always, even back in the day when we had songs that people knew, still there's nerves, which is good. Nerves are good.

[00:47:22.050] - Speaker 2
How was the reaction in different parts of the world, different countries?

[00:47:25.860] - Speaker 1
Pretty much across the board. Yeah, acceptance across the board. So beautiful. From Japan to Portugal to Australia to London. Yeah, everywhere, they accepted it in the street. And what's crazy is what started to happen because because of the music, we got put on a lot of jazz festival gigs. And so we're playing with the best of the best, the best of the best players. And what I started to notice is players would come backstage after and give their honest It was inspiring because it almost like we charged them up to do something. One player, I won't say his name, but it was like, Man, I wish I would have been doing this thing six months ago. You know what I mean? Because I It would be them permission to be free. Yeah, that's what I was about to say. I think what people love most about it was the freeness, the freedom. It's almost like a rally for it, a rally for freedom. I think people responded Mostly in that way.

[00:48:31.830] - Speaker 2
Last time we spoke, you said you were judgmental of yourself. Oh, yeah. Do you still feel the same or it's better? Oh, yeah. Same?

[00:48:38.760] - Speaker 1
It's still the same. It's still the same, but I think I understand more when I'm doing it and I Just try to move past the moment, breathe, take a deep breath, relax my shoulders and move past the moment, man. I don't think it's bad to be judgmental in certain ways because I think judging things is part of our survival. Even when you walk, you judge how far you're going to step. And you have to assess what's going on. We have brains to assess. So I think there's nothing wrong with it until it gets to a negative place. And I think you just got to pay attention because sometimes you need it. Sometimes if there's a threat around you, you know you're going to be in some street corners and you're like, Okay, something don't feel right. That's because you know. And that's all a part of it. You are analyzing, assessing every moment of what's happening. When you're doing it to yourself, sometimes maybe it is something you should look at, but sometimes it's bullshit.

[00:49:43.730] - Speaker 2
When you're playing in an improvisational way, which you do, how much of it is playing versus listening?

[00:49:54.890] - Speaker 1
I wouldn't even say 50/50, maybe 70 listening because you got to... And that's again, you're assessing what's happening to feel where are you going to sit? How do you enhance this moment? Or how do you sit back? How do you not say I can't say anything. So you have to listen. And because I'm not a trained musician, if you see the performance that I have this blanket down on the floor and I have maybe 30 flutes. And because I don't know keys, I don't know I'm not trained in that way. Sometimes you'll see me down on the floor auditioning them in a way.

[00:50:35.580] - Speaker 2
To see what's going to sound good. Yeah.

[00:50:38.480] - Speaker 1
So if Siri is playing a thing or if the Anthony is playing a thing that has a note, I play this. Oh, no, that don't sound good. Pick this one up. Yeah, this is the one. And you go in. So it's like you're listening the whole time. It's harder for me because I didn't go to music school to know, Oh, they're in the key of blah, blah, blah. So it's all- Just feel. It's all feel, ear, and physicality to me. A lot of times I play, sometimes I watch some of my favorite guitar players, they're physical. It makes a certain sound. And so I try to play in that way. The way you move your fingers rhythmically, I'm almost trying to wrangle something or wheel something to happen. So a lot of times I look at it like It's not jazz, what I'm doing. It's almost like impressions. If you were looking at art and you're looking at figurative art, and you see an actual thing, a body or whatever, it's almost like I'm doing an abstract version of it, like just an impression of something. So the notes will be right or wrong sometimes, but you're going to feel it, and it's going to create something that creates It's feeling.

[00:52:00.850] - Speaker 1
So I look at it in that way.

[00:52:03.310] - Speaker 2
It sounds pure in that way. In some ways, the lack of understanding gets you to a pure place of feeling because there's no math involved. Oh, yeah. Do you know what I'm saying? Yes. It really is you are with this thing that's happening, and it's real, and it's in this moment. That moment will likely not happen again. It won't.

[00:52:29.190] - Speaker 1
Even If we tried, there's no way. When we first started touring, because we created the album, Free Form, when we first started touring, we would try to play the numbers in a way because now I know some of the melodies I can go back to them. That was okay for a while, but it felt restrictive in a way. Because to me. I mean, we rocked it, but it felt restrictive because it was almost like I was trying to do a thing, which is different from just doing a thing. Doing a thing. You know what I mean? The wheels are off when you're just doing a thing. We moved quickly into every show just being free form, just like we made the album. It was just more authentic. Sometimes we may go back to one number, but it would be a crazy rendition of that song. It wasn't like... Even a jazz band, they'll do a version of their song. It's pretty much the same, but of course, they're stretching it out in a certain way. Yeah, this would be an impression of an impression of an impression.

[00:53:36.860] - Speaker 2
How many shows did you do about?

[00:53:38.870] - Speaker 1
A Running Joke, we did 120.

[00:53:42.260] - Speaker 2
Would you say over the course of those shows, you got better at doing it?

[00:53:47.560] - Speaker 1
I got better at not knowing what I'm doing. I got more confidence and having confidence that I don't know what I'm doing.

[00:53:55.240] - Speaker 2
And liking the results.

[00:53:58.730] - Speaker 1
Yes. There were times we would get off stage and man, we would just hug up and be like, Man, I don't know what just happened, but that shit was awesome. You can't get it back. Isn't that the best? That's what I'm saying. Here's the thing. I've made music all my life since I was 17. I've made songs, I've written choruses, I've made beats that people know when I go out to do it. And that's a great reward when the whole crowd is singing your verse or the whole crowd is singing the chorus. There's a whole another reward when you don't know what's about to happen and sun shines in. So we're all witnessing it at the same time. That's a whole another type of reward.

[00:54:40.740] - Speaker 2
Well, you're participating together in a miracle. It's the difference. Yes.

[00:54:45.080] - Speaker 1
It's almost like five people on one tight rope. Yeah. That's what it's like.

[00:54:50.420] - Speaker 2
It's just happening. It's almost like you're falling off, but you don't fall off.

[00:54:55.710] - Speaker 1
Even if you fall off, somebody may throw an arm out and you're banging it for a while, then they pull you back up. And just to pull up is beautiful to see. I can't explain it, man. I'm so happy that I was put in a position to be able to do it in this way.

[00:55:16.570] - Speaker 2
Do you imagine doing another album in this direction?

[00:55:21.570] - Speaker 1
Oh, man, we have so much music, so stay tuned. Here's the thing. We record everything. Oh, good. Even our sound checks. Oh, man. Sometimes our sound checks were crazy. And just the sound check. And so we record sound checks. We record every performance. But then, even before we hit the road, we almost recorded a whole two albums before we even put out New Blue Sun. So, yeah, there's a lot of music coming. I think my eyes right now are set on scoring film with it because it is something filmic about it. There's something orchestra, even. Even though we may not be playing orchestra instruments, we could totally score a movie live or someone write a movie to our pieces. I'm putting that out there. It'll happen.

[00:56:15.610] - Speaker 2
When you hear the pieces, does imagery come up for you? Do you see things when you're listening?

[00:56:22.360] - Speaker 1
It depends on where I am at the moment. Not necessarily where this made me think of a thing. But if I'm already in a zone, it can bring up thoughts.

[00:56:31.370] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the image on the cover of the album.

[00:56:34.800] - Speaker 1
Okay, so when we were talking about Venice, we were talking about that little house. That was a steal from the film called Moving Day. And I was just in my backyard with my flute, Dexter Navy, director. I met him at a juice bar, and Dexter was like, Hey, man, I want to just come film you do something. And we happened to be moving this one day, the last day in this little house. So I was like, Dexter, come through with your cameras or whatever. We'll shoot something. Dexter came through and we walked around Venice a little bit, walked around the house and went in the backyard, and he was filming me. And that was just a steal from me being in the backyard playing flute. So that's the album cover image.

[00:57:20.910] - Speaker 2
Cool. The position you're in reminds me of Arjuna.

[00:57:27.190] - Speaker 1
Arjuna.

[00:57:27.960] - Speaker 2
What's Arjuna? Arjuna, I believe, is an Indian God. If you see the image, I think it's Arjuna. I don't know. When I saw it, it's like, Oh, I know this image.

[00:57:40.960] - Speaker 1
I don't know. I have to look it up now. But it's great. Honestly, flute playing, when you talk about Michael Jordan's of a thing, my hero is an Indian flute player, Sherasia.

[00:57:57.250] - Speaker 2
Oh, my God. Let's listen to something. Let me something.

[00:58:00.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So this is a duet performance between Shiv Kummar Sharma and Harry Prasad Sharasia. And sometimes I'll sit on YouTube and I'll just watch this because they've recorded this performance live. It's so beautiful to watch. And he's the best to me. Oh, man, let me just shut up.

[00:58:24.930] - Speaker 4
Play this

[01:00:29.200] - Speaker 4
shit.

[01:04:03.360] - Speaker 4
One, two,

[01:06:25.930] - Speaker 4
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 10, 10, 10, Yeah, so That was amazing.

[01:07:31.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the whole album is called The Valley Recalls.

[01:07:34.790] - Speaker 2
What is that string instrument that sounds so plucky? Is it played with mallets?

[01:07:39.600] - Speaker 1
It's almost like a zither. Yeah, like a zither type of instrument. It's played with these little wooden sticks. To get a long note, you just let it bounce for a moment.

[01:07:50.930] - Speaker 2
So percussive. Yeah, it is. Wildly percussive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you listen a lot of instrumental music?

[01:07:58.250] - Speaker 1
Yeah, more so now than ever, I think, because it gives you space for your own thoughts. Because sometimes you can just get so caught up in the lyrics. Sometimes they're great lyrics. But instrumental music, it's just move, score, score for whatever you're going to do. I really dig that a lot.

[01:08:23.670] - Speaker 2
How do you describe the energy you feel in music?

[01:08:27.880] - Speaker 1
When I was heavy into religion, I felt it was religious in a way. I remember times when I first started producing, I'd be in my studio and I just finished a beat and I'm by myself, so I'm in the studio In my draws, playing a beat. It'll be so moving to me. I remember standing up on a chair and just like, oh. Standing up on the chair, feeling like there's a God or there's something. You know what I mean? Because it's an energy in it.

[01:09:07.070] - Speaker 2
It wasn't that you were great. It's that it was great.

[01:09:10.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that there's something moving. Because I know. I'm just dealing with things, moving them around because there's energy in it. And it's infectious, too. I remember there's times when we were mixing The Love Below, the mix engine, then Neil Poe. We were both at the mixing board, finishing up a mix, doing something. We were listening back to a song, and I remember both of us just sitting there at the board in tears. Like tears. As we're mixing this fucking song, I'm like, whoa, something is happening. And it's that powerful. And that's what I'm going for. I always like, I'm trying to go for the feel. What does it make you feel? I think I was a really emotional kid, too. So when I heard music as a child, those were... And it hit me in a way that got me emotional. Even from someone else's story. I remember when I first heard Fast Car from Tracy Chapman. I've said this before, but there's a line where she says she had to drop out of school to take care of her drunk dad. And I remember as a kid, like, whoa. And I felt it. She's storytelling.

[01:10:24.730] - Speaker 1
Heavy. And then the story comes around. Her mom because her dad wasn't living up to what she thought it would be. She wanted more than life than he could give. But she was like, I'm the daughter, so somebody's got to take care of him. Oh, that's what it was. So somebody's got to take care of him. So I quit school. That's what I did. I was like, whoa. And that hit me so hard. I was like, Oh, so you can tell real emotion. You can tell stuff that's happening in this music. I've always strived to to get some realness. I want people to feel it the same way I felt it.

[01:11:05.360] - Speaker 2
Do you feel like there's something about the music that's biographical?

[01:11:09.070] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, biographical and mirror-like to other people. Especially as a rapper, I always respected it when I felt like I was hearing something from a rapper that was them. That's one thing I always respect about rap music and punk music and rock and roll. There was a certain rawness that I liked that I always responded to. That slice of real life, no matter how good or bad it is, is powerful.

[01:11:39.450] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your spiritual life.

[01:11:41.810] - Speaker 1
I don't have much of a spiritual life, to be honest. When I was younger, I did I was heavy. He was heavy into the church. I think I was just raised that way. Yeah, I'm not so much now.

[01:11:52.890] - Speaker 2
Where did the song titles come from?

[01:11:55.300] - Speaker 1
Some were just thoughts I had laying around. Some were me trying to almost try to break up the expectation of this type of music. I think a lot of people feel like if you play flute or you're into this type of world, that you're not a full human that you may not curse, that you may not have sex. I'm trying to bring some humanness to it, too. In the titles, it was almost like I was trying to even it out in a way because I knew people would take it in a heavy way. I was trying to sometimes be comical with the titles, sometimes express things because I knew there was no lyrics. So that was the only place I had to-You could say anything. When we would do these free form recordings, we were recording so fast that sometimes we were just naming them places. And even the first song used to be called Beyond the Faros. And that's because as soon as we finished playing it and went into control and to listen, I was like, Man, I can't wait to Darryl Sanders, Here's this. And he ended up passing away before the album could come out.

[01:13:08.850] - Speaker 1
Sometimes the songs are just quick thoughts. One song used to be called All Occasions. All Occasions ended up being the slang word pussy. But when we first played it and listened back to it, it's like, Man, you can do anything. So this song works for all occasions. You can be romantic moment. Sometimes it's just a quick place, but I felt like I knew people would read the title, so that was the only place that I had to say something.

[01:13:46.610] - Speaker 2
How do you think breath instruments are different than other instruments?

[01:13:51.100] - Speaker 1
The reason why I was attracted to breath instruments is because it's the only instrument besides the human voice where you're actually hearing the human. With a piano, your finger hits a key, key hits a hammer, hammer hits a string, then you hear the sound of guitar, your pick hits the string, or your finger hits the string, reverberates. So it's something in between the human. With flute a flute and wind, you're actually hearing the wind of a human.

[01:14:18.880] - Speaker 2
And if you stop blowing, the sound stops. Whereas you can hit a guitar cord, it'll keep ringing after you've hit it.

[01:14:26.280] - Speaker 1
So you're hearing the breath of The breath of life in an instrument is the closest thing to singing. That's why when we just listen to Teresia, to me, he plays Indian singing. They're so skillful with how they go in between notes and even like, I'm doing a horrible job of it, but he plays in that way, the way they practice singing. I think it's dope when you can mimic that. Even you think saxophone and vibrato is to mimic a singer. That was to mimic what sing. And a lot of saxophone players early on, they were playing in the style of the crooners. So they're already mimicking human voice with the flute. You're actually hearing that when.

[01:15:24.490] - Speaker 2
Tell me about going around the world, going to antique stores, going to music stores, finding old instruments. I imagine you come across some interesting people, also the people who make the instruments when they make them for you. Tell me about some of the characters you've come across.

[01:15:40.640] - Speaker 1
Well, there's one favorite store that we go to in the Bay. It's called Lark in the Morning. It's this odd instrument store that has all these odd instruments. We're always so excited when we go to the Bay because we're like, All right, we're going to Lark in the Morning. We all get in the van and go check out what they have new because they just got instruments from all the world. Some instruments in there are made by musicians that are just trying to make new instruments. So there's actually a mallet instrument that's like a xylophone that I play on stage that I bought from there. It's like this xylophone that's in a key. So there are no bad notes on it. It's almost like a pandrom in a way. But I get flutes all the time. At shows, people will come and some of their handmade flutes. At this point, I have so many flutes, whistles, and shakers. Yeah, I get a lot of.

[01:16:41.180] - Speaker 2
I just remember any time I would go to any Collectors of anything. They were always the most interesting people.

[01:16:50.390] - Speaker 1
Yes. Well, we go to a lot of flea markets, and a lot of people there are very interested because they just sit and collect things, and they're experts at it, and they'll tell you It's good to hear their stories.

[01:17:02.690] - Speaker 2
How does the place you're in impact the playing?

[01:17:07.770] - Speaker 1
A lot, especially the actual room, the environment.

[01:17:11.240] - Speaker 2
Sonically or what you see? Both.

[01:17:13.930] - Speaker 1
Sometimes it's just the energy of a crowd can make you play away. Sometimes I may have been agitated at something, and I'll play like an angry bird. Not the game, but I'll play like... Yeah, I'll just trying to play through it in a certain way because there's some staleness happening in the room, and you're trying to shake it up.

[01:17:39.900] - Speaker 2
What are some of your favorite places on the planet?

[01:17:42.990] - Speaker 1
Japan, of course. Japan is one of my favorite places.

[01:17:47.020] - Speaker 2
Tokyo or Kyoto or other parts?

[01:17:50.100] - Speaker 1
Kyoto. I love Tokyo as well. Osaka. Have you been to the Art Islands?

[01:17:55.550] - Speaker 2
Mm-mm.

[01:17:56.270] - Speaker 1
Oh, man, you got to check it out. I get on this barge and go out to this island Island that they dedicated just for artists. So there's museums there.

[01:18:04.830] - Speaker 2
That sounds great.

[01:18:05.620] - Speaker 1
No, you got to check it out. I will. Amsterdam is a new favorite place. I like Amsterdam a lot.

[01:18:12.570] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:18:13.070] - Speaker 1
There's something about the art and fashion there that's killer to me. Mexico City, I like. Hawaii, I like. Florence was one of my favorite places. Back in 2008, when I was working on Benjamin Bixby, the clothing line, I spent a A lot of time in Florence and Hong Kong. Actually, I like Hong Kong as well. But Florence, man, the colors, the food. I was amazed. You may just see a door open and you'll see people going in and you'll walk in and it'll be a restaurant, but they won't have a menu. No sign or anything. Yeah, no sign, no menu. This is what we're making today. And if you want some, cool. And you go in, it's the best food you ever had. But it's free, man. I love it. The food is not free. You got to pay for it. But I'm saying it's a free way of thinking, saying, Well, this is what we're offering today.

[01:19:12.770] - Speaker 2
It's like going to someone's house for dinner, really. Exactly.

[01:19:15.180] - Speaker 1
I love Florence.

[01:19:17.220] - Speaker 2
That's my favorite. It's the only city I could ever imagine living in. I don't like cities, but I like Florence.

[01:19:23.970] - Speaker 1
Okay. All right. That's a good way to think.

[01:19:27.160] - Speaker 2
Tell me about music that comes from plants.

[01:19:30.610] - Speaker 1
Carlos Ninho, sometimes, depending on the city, he always likes to go and grab a fallen branch from wherever we are of leaves or something. And so in his arsenal, he just has just stuff. And so plants are actually on the record. So they're just different plants. And depending on what region we're in, he'll go out and find it and he'll bring it in and and shake on it, and it'll be awesome.

[01:20:03.130] - Speaker 2
Before you started the album, did you make any rules about what you wouldn't, wouldn't use or do? Were there any like, We're not going to use any of these instruments or only this parameter?

[01:20:14.590] - Speaker 1
That's funny because when we first started, the only rule, not even a rule, the only intention was I want to transport people from wherever they are. And everybody was, Oh, yeah, we got that. That's easy. But one thing we quickly found, even though I love saxophone, I quickly found that as soon as I hear a saxophone, it pulls me to jazz. And so we made the decision to... Because we recorded some great songs with saxophone on them for some of the sessions for this album, but I didn't necessarily want it to sit in the jazz mode. I wanted to be more experimental. And so at a certain point, I was like, Lois, man, yeah, I don't know if I want any saxophone.

[01:21:01.800] - Speaker 2
That's a real specific choice because it really does change it because saxophone does say jazz.

[01:21:08.400] - Speaker 1
Depending on how you play it. It's true.

[01:21:10.410] - Speaker 2
Unless it doesn't sound like saxophone, which is possible.

[01:21:13.520] - Speaker 1
Right. Yeah. And I love jazz, but it's like, I think for what we were going for, I didn't want it to sit in the jazz band, even though there are jazz fans that come to what we're doing.

[01:21:25.180] - Speaker 2
But it makes it too on the nose. It's like too strong a label to put on it. Like a limitation.

[01:21:32.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:21:33.040] - Speaker 2
Have you ever worked in any physical media, paint, ceramics, anything like that?

[01:21:38.700] - Speaker 1
Sure. All of them. Actually, before even rapping as a child, since I was a very little child, always would draw and paint, make things, build things. And even now, as I get older, I'd see me doing it more. Even during the Outkast times, I would draw things on the CD. And since I've been living in Cali, I started going to Cali Cal State and doing ceramics at Cal State. So there are sculptures that I've done that you'll see at some point. Painting is huge for me right now. I keep a sketchbook with me. I draw all the time because to me, it's the best way to pitch an idea or tell you something, because sometimes words, the interpretation is just too vast. So if I can show you a picture or a drawing of what I'm talking about, your brain connects to it easier than me saying it. Because if I say, Yeah, man, I want this cool shirt. Cool can mean a lot of things. My shirt can mean a lot of things to different things. But if I draw it, your brain is right there, at least closest to what I'm saying.

[01:22:46.920] - Speaker 2
How did you get to name 3000?

[01:22:49.970] - Speaker 1
3000 came around 1999, right during the Y2K scare. I was like, Man, Let's think ahead. So 3000 is the year 3000. We're going to 2000. I was like, No, 3000. So it was like, Andre, 3000. And then it just became like an additive or like a moniker. So if I was in the studio and I'm in the control room working on a beat or some music, and my homies would pop their head in. Depending on what type of music I was making, they'll say, if it was out there, they'd be like, Oh, that's that 3000 shit. You know what I mean? And then they'll close the door and then go back out. You know what I mean? If it was wild or pushing it, that was that 3000. So it became like an adjunct for next, pushing it.

[01:23:44.600] - Speaker 2
I would say the flute album is 3000.

[01:23:47.760] - Speaker 1
Oh, man, I hope. It's funny you say that, too, because I was wondering, should I even call it Andre 3000? Yeah, I understand that. Because now, in retrospect, and I I'm happy about the decision because in retrospect, I was like, well, if we just called it just the New Blue Sun Band. Name of a project. Yeah, and that was just it. I think it would have had a different life. I think so, too. I think what was important was the trajectory of this person from where I'm from to doing what I'm doing. I think that's all a part of the journey, all a part of the music. I'm glad it was an Andre 3000 out at the end. Me, too. It's crazy, too. Can you think of it? Because it actually turned a lot of people onto it. And with Crazy Things, I had T. I had Gs and them coming to the shows. I was just happy that people were coming to check it out in a way. That probably wouldn't have never checked out this thing. So I think it was a good bridge. I love bridges. I love things that connect things.

[01:24:50.860] - Speaker 1
So I think Outkast was a nice bridge for a lot of people.

[01:24:55.780] - Speaker 2
Can you think of any other artist who was known so specifically for doing something and did something as different as you've done? Successfully. That's another part of it because you've done it successfully. It's hard, right?

[01:25:15.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I can't really think. And not just music, in anything.

[01:25:20.380] - Speaker 2
In anything.

[01:25:24.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:25:25.200] - Speaker 2
It's interesting, right?

[01:25:26.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:25:27.080] - Speaker 2
If there is anyone, it's a short list. If it exists, but I can't come up with any examples.

[01:25:33.680] - Speaker 1
Well, my homie Boots from the crew made music in the '90s up to 2000s and then started directing films. Films are also successful. That's another change. Yeah, that's another major change.

[01:25:49.330] - Speaker 2
Tell me about piano improvisation.

[01:25:54.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah, sometimes just to get an idea down, I just put on your voice notes and record from my iPhone. And so I started just putting the iPhone on the piano when I wake up just to record whatever I'm doing. And as a fun thing, I would send these little shorts. Sometimes they're like a minute, sometimes they're two, three minutes. I would send them to my son. I would send them to his mom, Erica. I would send them to my stepdad, to my mom, to even musician friends. I might send it to Q-Tip. I might send it to Tyler. So when they look back and they phone history, if they still have some of those texts from back then, they're going to find these piano pieces on the album. They were just personal at home recordings. And then when I listened back to them, I just thought there's something special about them. And I thought, maybe I should share them in a way. Even though it is iPhone quality, we mastered it, put it to vinyl. So it's almost like a novelty project.

[01:26:56.450] - Speaker 2
Do you think of it as a musical A diary?

[01:27:02.350] - Speaker 1
Well, more like a photobook. From this time, this is a snap.

[01:27:07.840] - Speaker 2
Can you play me something from it?

[01:27:10.080] - Speaker 1
Sure. So this song is called Blueberry Mountains. This is one of the songs. There are two songs on this album that are not improv. This is one of them, but it's improv and how I performed it because I never performed it like this. And this song is one of the first songs that I ever tried to compose on piano. Ever. This was recorded on a very bright piano, and I don't like bright pianos for some reason. So I was like, well, what can I do with these bright pianos? So I was trying to find a way to just lean into the brightness. And so I told the engineer, you know how trap rappers, like Future, they'll put autotune on their vocals, and it gives it some type of digital coding on the voice. And so I was like, after I play this, can we put autotune on the piano? Cool. But it wasn't changing my notes or anything. It just put this almost like this digital water. Yeah. So you'll hear it almost makes an acoustic piano sound fake.

[01:28:13.890] - Speaker 2
Cool.

[01:28:14.420] - Speaker 1
Blueberry Mountains.

[01:30:01.350] - Speaker 2
So when it had words, what were the words?

[01:30:04.980] - Speaker 1
Blueberry, Blueberry Mountain, Strawberry, Strawberry Hills. It was like a Beatles reference. Blueberry Mountain, Strawberry Hills, Banana Peels for Hills. That was the chorus. Blueberry Mountain, Strawberry Hills, Banana Pills for Hills. I have no idea what I was talking about at the time.

[01:30:25.280] - Speaker 2
Was there verses, too?

[01:30:27.970] - Speaker 1
Yes. It was like a in between those choruses, and it was saying, While you up on the hill in your big homes, I'm out here risk in my dome. Blueberry Mountain, Strawberry Hills, Banana Pills for Hill. While you up on the hill in your big homes, I'm down here risk in my dome. Blueberry Mountains. That's how I can remember from it.

[01:30:50.200] - Speaker 2
Cool. It's beautiful.

[01:30:52.540] - Speaker 1
Thank you, man.

[01:30:53.460] - Speaker 2
In a time when everything is quantized and autotuned and perfected, hearing Having something that sounds human, even if it's got a synthetic edge to it, is interesting. It feels like a moment in time. Yes.

[01:31:08.990] - Speaker 1
To me, that's really when you think of the new Blue Sun and what this is now, I know a lot of people criticize it for being a certain thing. But what I'm looking for right now is moments, like special moments. Not perfect. I'm not looking for perfection. I'm not looking for, quote, unquote, hits or anything. I love a hit. I love perfection, too. But What's interesting to me are things that are actually interesting. And so we mastered this. I was sitting with Bernie Grumman, and he was listening to it, and he was like, Oh, man, this is refreshing. He said, I master a lot of things. And he's like, A lot of times it comes in as a bar. Everyone just wants loud, loud, loud, loud. And he was saying, I understand why they want it loud because they want to compete in the club or wherever. But once you get the attention from being loud, you have to hold that attention and it becomes uninteresting. After a while, and when we were mastering these pieces, he was like, There's something. He said, I love that there's dynamic in it. They're jumping out. They get quiet.

[01:32:14.130] - Speaker 1
It's like he described it as being classical in a way, in some ways, where things jump out and then they get really quiet. And that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the specialness. I almost call them novelty records. I'm What I'm doing now is making records that if I'm going to collect, I always look at from the outside. If I'm not me, I would want to collect this album. I want to collect New Blue Sun.

[01:32:39.790] - Speaker 2
Because it's not like other albums. Yes. This is the one like that.

[01:32:43.410] - Speaker 1
And a year from now, I would want this. I would like, whoa, Andre did this. Andre did this. So it's for me, it's the novelty specialness of it. I think it has a lot to do with age, too, because at this age, I'm trying to things that I feel of beauty or a specialness. You know what I mean? That means a lot. In my eyes, of course, pop music can mean a lot for sure. I'm not saying that, but for me, in what I've done and what I've been through, this is most interesting for me.

[01:33:19.460] - Speaker 4
.
