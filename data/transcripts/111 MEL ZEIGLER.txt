Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. All my life, I'm a writer at the core that has wandered into other paths in life. But I found my way into Eastern philosophy after I sold my company. After 10 solid years, it seemed like one day in building a company. I don't think we saw a movie. I don't think we went anywhere. We just did anything except work for 10 solid years. It was over, and it was a very strange experience. I was 43 years old. It was over. Something I had built from $1,500 to a substantial company was gone. The 3,000 employees were gone because it was an acquisition, and we didn't quite fit into the corporate culture of the Gap, and it was time to leave. I decided to go to a retreat. I had never done it, and it was one of the Vipassana retreats, somewhere up in Santa Rosa. When I went there, I didn't know anything about it. So I took a whole pile of books, and I took sketchpads, and I was just going to pour out everything on those pages. And the teacher said, Well, here's the rules. No talking, no reading, no anything.

[00:01:53.720] - Speaker 1
Just sit for 45 minutes and walk for 45 minutes. I said, What? Am Okay. I was game. I stayed for it. It was odd. I was unsettled for the first day or two. Then I got this excruciating headache, and it wouldn't go away. I said, I'm never going to let this happen to me before. It's because there's no coffee here. I'm going to start a tea company, which is exactly what I shouldn't have been doing in a meditation treat. For the first next several days, I was dreaming up the Republic of Tea. And then I finally fell into the meditative state, and I could hear further than I could. I didn't realize I could hear so far. I was stunned at what I was hearing. Hearing, I would say, is my strongest sense. It always has been. After that, I came back and told my wife and she just... Of course, we had just sold a successful company. We were very visible and we were getting all kinds of offers. Let's do this, let's do that, let's do this. I said, I'm going to do nothing. I'm going to just do nothing because I just realized that I was like a wound up toy.

[00:03:20.760] - Speaker 1
Succeed, achieve, succeed, achieve, succeed. It was in my DNA.

[00:03:25.130] - Speaker 2
Had it been like that your whole life?

[00:03:27.970] - Speaker 1
From childhood, would you say? In the intense way, Melvin, maybe you'll be a doctor. I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. There was a lovely part of town that was called the Hill Section, which was a Jewish community.

[00:03:43.150] - Speaker 2
Suburban?

[00:03:44.150] - Speaker 1
No, it was in the town. Scranton is about 100,000 people. It's an old coal mining town, about two and a half hours from New York as you go through New Jersey. And somehow Jews had found their way there and set up a little community there. And it was middle class, 1950s, Everybody had come home from the war. Everything was so comforting. What a difference. When I even talk about the 1950s, what a difference it was to today. But it was a very sweet place, and it was a very sweet way to grow up. Many years later, when I brought my wife back, she said to me, Nobody's mean here. It was a high school reunion, the 50th high school reunion, the sweetest people ever. So I grew up in that. But my grandparents were first generation, and my parents were second generation. They didn't go to college, and a lot was expected. I was going to go to college and I was going to do that. And my dad said, She should be a pharmacist. What's a pharmacist? He was in the war in Germany. He was a very simple, sweet man. I loved him so much.

[00:04:53.440] - Speaker 1
He was a modus adfa. I realized long after he was gone, he died at 59. Anyway, I found my way out of there.

[00:05:04.250] - Speaker 2
You think of yourself as a writer. You started as a writer. Do you think of yourself as a writer or a journalist? I think of them as different.

[00:05:10.820] - Speaker 1
They are. I should say, actually, even though I said that, neither. I'm an observer. I've tried for many years to shed the amazing amount of judgment and screams I had in order to see the world. And what What I have tried to do is reach that objective space. I'm hardly ever there, but it's my goal to be in that objective space. I'm a student of ancient Chinese philosophies, particularly Dao When I read a Daoism book where the statement was, Forget yourself, follow objective circumstances. That's pretty much what I try to do. I don't think of myself as anything fixed.

[00:05:58.140] - Speaker 2
When did you first come in contact with the After the retreat, I swallowed every Krishnamurti book first because I'm a thinker.

[00:06:10.340] - Speaker 1
I think obsessively. I'm full of concepts. I'm full of ideas. I found him. He gave me a path to just make me realize that I'm just living in a sworn of thought and seeing nothing. I read every single book, and I listened to the lectures, and then somehow or another, I picked up Lautzu. But the one that really did it to me was Cheung Hsu. I don't know how you pronounce his name. He's the one. Quan Hsu, I think.

[00:06:44.820] - Speaker 2
Cheung Hsu.

[00:06:45.130] - Speaker 1
He's the rogue. I really related to this guy. He was just making fun of everything and having fun and having a good time. At the same time, through him, I began to realize that the Dao that can be told is not the DAO. How am I ever going to describe it to you? But it was this total vision of observing in tune with nature. Everything was part of nature, including human beings. In fact, I remember having this conversation years ago with Jack Cornfield. I said, you DAO was frustrating me because I'm just the same thing as that. The storm, the weather, it's the same thing. So it really spoke to me. It spoke to me, and it got me to a place where I really tasted the emptyness. Tasted it. Is there anything more delicious when you think about It's an emptyness.

[00:07:48.550] - Speaker 2
That's it. Peace. I love the Dow.

[00:07:53.810] - Speaker 1
I love- Oh, I bet. I could see from your book that you live it, and I admire you. It's It's something you don't really want to talk about because it's- It's hard to talk about. Yeah, it defies that.

[00:08:08.870] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your writing days.

[00:08:11.950] - Speaker 1
Well, I was a journalist. The way I was going to get out of Scranton was to write my way out of Scranton. Scranton was wonderful in many ways. What it didn't introduce me to, I regret to say, was music and art, which became my passions, particularly art, as the time went on. Years writer and is currently, really. Now I paint, but I was a journalist, and I wrote for my high school magazine, and I enjoyed it. I was just writing little stories, actually, short stories at that point. But then I got a job at the Scranton Tribune, writing a front-page column called The Weather. That's all it was. Cloudy with a chance of rain. But I was so excited.

[00:09:00.060] - Speaker 2
How would you know?

[00:09:04.610] - Speaker 1
There was a weather bureau, I guess you called, and they told you. The temperature range and everything else. Then it became a copy boy. Then it was time to go to college. I went to Penn State. It's all we really could afford at that time. It was a state school. It was a wonderful school. It was in State College, Pennsylvania. I don't know if you've ever been there, but it's beautiful. A wonderful school.

[00:09:31.880] - Speaker 2
Did you study journalism?

[00:09:33.120] - Speaker 1
I studied journalism. Then I heard that the place to study journalism was really Columbia. I applied to and went to Columbia. I happened to be there in the vintage year, 1968, when everything exploded. It's very similar to what happened this last year. This was the year of Berkeley in Columbia. And there were protests on campus about the universities expansion into Morningside Heights, taking away the neighborhood. I mean, it's very prescient to all of that happening. I didn't know about that. Yeah, it was in the '60s, and they occupied the buildings. They were total occupations of the buildings. Wow. Here I was a journalist, in the journalism school, and two buildings over was Low Library, which is where the President was. I'm walking out one day and the whole campus is full of protesters. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. And when I went to Penn State, they were hoot-nannies. That dates me. When I was leaving, it was protest songs. It was beginning. I got caught up in this, and yet I was a journalist. I saw this. The students had occupied the president's office, Grace and Kirk. They were all over the campus, but the big thing is they were occupying his office.

[00:10:55.050] - Speaker 1
It was a remarkable as I remember, because the women had set up a kitchen in the office. I mean, you can think about that. The women were setting up the kitchen in the office. The guys were whatever they were doing. There's a ledge that goes around Low Library. It's about maybe 8, 10 feet tall. If you get to that ledge, you can go into the office. I wanted to go into the office as a reporter. I wanted to find a story here. I wasn't sure whether I was a reporter or I I didn't know. I wasn't sure who I was, what this was all about. I was just learning about it myself.

[00:11:35.770] - Speaker 2
Was it exciting?

[00:11:37.150] - Speaker 1
It was extraordinary. It was exhilarating. They shut down the school. We never had a graduation. It was like last year. It was the precursor and probably the only time to the unfortunate protest last year and much more justified, I would say. Anyway, so I didn't know if there was a reporter. I didn't know if I was And I came out and it was time to go and graduate. And I wrote a story, and the story was published in the Miami Herald. It just interviewed me for a job. I sent them the story. They published the story and offered me a job. And I think I also wrote a story for New York magazine at the time, which was just starting up again. It used to be earlier was the Sunday supplement of a paper called... It was a fusion paper, Harold Tribune, the one that became the International. And it was a really elegant newspaper. But Clay Falker, who was the editor of New York when it was in that paper, bought the rights to it when the paper folded and then regenerated New York magazine. And that's how it came to be. And one of my teachers at the time was Dick Schapp, he's a sportscaster.

[00:12:49.380] - Speaker 1
We became very good friends. And he introduced me to Clay, and then I started writing for New York magazine. But I got very tired of New work after a couple of years and found my way West. But I was still a journalist. At that time, I came to San Francisco, and I was going to write a novel.

[00:13:16.560] - Speaker 2
How did you choose San Francisco?

[00:13:19.240] - Speaker 1
I chose it in Colorado. We were driving across the country. I was either going to go to Mexico, point south. I had a girlfriend. We were driving an old French Simca that we had bought the year before and shipped over. We didn't know what it was, but what certainly was going to be was not New York. Because the 1970s in New York was hell. I mean, it was garbage strikes. Dog shit all over the sidewalks, nobody picking up after themselves. No regard. It was what am I doing here? And I had a friend who was in Hastings Law School in San Francisco earlier, and I'd flown out to see him. It was a beautiful February day. San Francisco was really enchanting after that. I said, I just feel like I belong here.

[00:14:10.820] - Speaker 2
What year was this?

[00:14:11.630] - Speaker 1
This was 1972, I think, 1972.

[00:14:18.190] - Speaker 2
Summer Love had already happened.

[00:14:20.270] - Speaker 1
It had already happened. What I didn't know is that four years earlier, my wife was happening with it. She grew up in San Francisco. Oh, great. There's an interesting story there. But I did what I do. There were two papers at that time, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner. I got a job at the San Francisco Chronicle, and I had a great time. It was fun. I was on the city desk. It was a room that was huge. A huge room with reporters sitting here, the art department there, the photography studio there, the Sunday section there. It was huge. It was like a little city, city room. And it was almost out of the movie, the front page, there was an editor by the name of Aiden Melenkopf who had a moniker, and he would stand up and he would say, Ziegler, 474 Hyde, Baby in a Trash Bin. Get a photographer. And you'd get a photographer and you would just basically go find the abandoned baby in the trash. I mean, this was it. And it was wild. These were the years of the zebra killings. Wow. And the zebra killings were happening. And I was there on the nightbeat writing the story about what just happened in the streets.

[00:15:42.920] - Speaker 1
And at 2: 00 in the morning, going down to catch a bus at Fifth and Mission to take me to Mill Valley, where I lived completely by myself. But anyway, I enjoyed that. I enjoyed working. I enjoyed being part of the city. I enjoyed learning everything.

[00:15:59.760] - Speaker 2
Do you Do you think the fact that you came from a different place added to it? Part of your job was you're like a fish out of water in this new environment, and your job is to observe it and report on it.

[00:16:13.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Drink it in. Take it all. Yes, it was absolutely… The West Coast was totally new to me. It was a completely different mentality. One that I summarize this way, Clive Felker, who was the editor of New York magazine at that time, later went to come teach at Berkeley. And I ran into him a party maybe 15 years later and he said, Didn't you used to be Mel Ziegler? That's funny. That's New York. Yeah. And so I was very happy not to be there. I was very happy not to be there. I was learning a whole new way of life. You could do anything. It was free. Freedom is wealth. It's not It's not money. It's freedom. And I felt that freedom. It was exhilarating being there. And these were good years. They were crazy years because I was also there when the Patty Hearst kidnapping took place, which was really crazy. I mean, it was just crazy. Did you cover that story? Yeah. I was part of covering. Everybody covered that story. If you were on the shift and you were down there, you were in front of the Hearst mansion where Atherton and somebody would say, Hey, Ziegler, your tree is ringing.

[00:17:32.060] - Speaker 1
They'd have a phone hooked up to the tree. It was wild being in the newspaper business. It was wonderful. I loved it. Journalism was different in those days as well. I mean, these were the days of Walter Cronkite. I mean, these were the days when at least there was an effort to be objective. The world hadn't seen Rupert Murdoch yet. It was going to brand news and a brand point of view and create this situation where everything became contrary to everything. I mean, it was just... Then it was just, here's the story. You couldn't even use the word I Why a reporter said, a reporter saw. You wrote it by yourself in the third person. I so I loved it.

[00:18:24.200] - Speaker 2
It's completely changed. But the only point of view was what you saw. You weren't given an agenda to try to make the story It means something.

[00:18:30.850] - Speaker 1
Yes, or to put it through the filter. It was no filter. No filter. It was just objectivity. Your job is to be objective. What really happened? Give us both sides of the story. Quote them both. Just lay it out.

[00:18:47.380] - Speaker 2
It's nice hearing both sides of the story. Yes, isn't it?

[00:18:50.100] - Speaker 1
I love it. I mean, this is what's wrong. This is really this would fix everything if people would just, Hey, why do you feel that way?

[00:19:03.900] - Speaker 2
It's funny you talk about going back to Scranton and the people being nice. You'd think that the people in San Francisco would be really nice. There was a time when they were.

[00:19:14.280] - Speaker 1
They were. Do you remember those days? Yes. They were.

[00:19:19.130] - Speaker 2
Well, everybody was nice.

[00:19:20.410] - Speaker 1
My wife will tell me stories about she hitchhiked here, and somebody said, Come to dinner. She'd stay three weeks with somebody, beautiful people who were working in Stanford. This I mean, it was that city. Yeah. I don't even know when it happened. It had happened. I don't know how it happened. I guess the answer is always day by day.

[00:19:43.840] - Speaker 2
How many years did you continue being a journalist?

[00:19:47.010] - Speaker 1
I was a journalist until I met my wife there. She is an illustrator. I told you about this big city room. Well, one day, this very beautiful woman was walking in and turning into the art department, which was right behind the Xerox machine and all the way at the other side of the room. Somehow or another, when I saw her, I saw my other half. But I'm pretty shy. I think that's one of the reasons I liked being a reporter is I couldn't be shy. I had to get out there and do what I did. It brought me out of that. But I During the Christmas party, the two other buddies of mine who were both reporters, we all decided to walk over and find out who this new girl was. And so the three of us walked over. Something happened in that moment where the two of them somehow disappeared. Patricia and I It's gone into a conversation that we're still in.

[00:20:48.850] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:20:50.450] - Speaker 1
I love her now more than I've ever loved anyone. She's my wife. It's almost 50 years.

[00:20:56.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah, beautiful. Congratulations.

[00:20:59.590] - Speaker 1
Well, we We had our troubles. We didn't get here. It wasn't a clear road.

[00:21:04.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:21:05.330] - Speaker 1
I mean, we really had trouble, but we knew we were connected at the core. She was there, I was there. We were having a great time. I was in my late 20s. I wanted to travel. I wanted to see the world. And the Chronicle was just a very cheap paper. It was known as being a cheap paper. They wouldn't send you anywhere to do anything. And there was no other game in town. It wasn't like today with media. You go here, you go there. There were three television stations, if you're in journalism. There were two newspapers. Then the Kpk, one newspaper. There was nowhere else to go. I could freelance, which I began to do, writing magazine articles for different magazines and doing that thing. But I wanted to travel, and we didn't have any money. We had nothing. I basically lift off our salaries, which were $400, $500 a week then. I can't even remember what they were. They weren't much. I'm never going to do this unless I find a way out of here. So the two of us, she's an artist to the core, beautiful artist. We said, well, what should we do with it?

[00:22:15.220] - Speaker 1
Let's start a business. We got to start a business. You got to understand, I'm from the '60s, and business was not a good word. It was never a good word. I had no... I had total this day for business, businessman, anything to do with business. They were screwing up everything. And this is what it was all about. These were the Nixon years and everything, and I just know. But one day, I was in the bookstore, a library or something else, and I see this book that says, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. It was just one of these very simple books, but I thought there's some magic in me passing this thing, and I should look at this. And they gave a formula. It says, think of how much money you want to make. Think I think of how long it's going to take you to make that money and get started. It's basically what it was saying. In other words, come up with something, do something. And at that time, I was on an assignment, actually, in Australia. I was sent to Australia. I was paying the rent by freelancing. We wanted to travel so badly.

[00:23:27.400] - Speaker 1
The Patricia and I both quit the Chronicle on the same day We had an idea of what we were going to do. Somehow we were going to do this. And then all this happened later. These are how the times were so different. You could be this impetuous. Things weren't this expensive. It wasn't this hard. It wasn't so stratified. It was just easier. And so I was in Australia. I went into a disposal store, which is their version of a surplus store. And that's all I ever dressed in was army surplus. Only the Navy P-coats or these jackets or whatever. I just went to the army surplus. I never wore anything but army surplus. I love the idea of, here I'm going to go into a new place with new surplus. And I walked into the disposal store and I found this old khaki jacket. I picked it up. It was an old British Burma jacket made surplus by the UK somewhere in the late 1940s and somehow found itself into this thing. And when I got off the plane and Patricia picked me up at SFO, she saw the jacket. Where did Where did you get that jacket?

[00:24:31.140] - Speaker 1
Where did you get that? And then I wore it to work. I wore it to play. Where did you get that jacket? Where did you get that jacket? Patricia started changing the buttons, putting patches on the sleeves, leather behind the counter. I said, Wait a minute. This is how much you want to make. This is how long it's going to take you to make it. This is what we're going to do. We're going to sell surplus clothes as fashion.

[00:24:57.300] - Speaker 2
It started as essentially army surplus.

[00:25:00.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's all it was. That's all it was. And all I had was $1,500. We had $1,500 between the two of us. Not anymore that we had saved. You could do that in those days. And I have this fail-safe system that if I ever go below Whatever it was at that point, like $1,000. I wasn't going to spend any money. This is my part of me that says, sorry, you starve now while you have $1,000 in the bank and figure it out. So we were down that low. I was down to $1,500. Jackets.

[00:25:30.970] - Speaker 2
How did you start the business?

[00:25:33.170] - Speaker 1
I'm a reporter. I started researching it. I started looking this. Well, this is how army surplus is sold. Well, in the United States, it was sold by the government in huge lots. They would just sell a huge lot and then take it off to places like Travis Air Force Basin, lot number one, lot number two, lot number three, used airplane propellers, excess toothpaste, shorts. You'd have to buy the whole lot and then sell it off. These were the jobbers who were the wholesale version who fed the phone stores. Have you ever gone to one of those? We went there and tried to buy something. We just needed to get the jackets, and we didn't need the toothpaste or the propellers or whatever it else it was. We didn't know what to do with them. We didn't have the money for them. We had to go to the jobber, and he was in Oakland. We realized that there were only about six or seven of these guys who were really bidding these things up all across the country. They all knew each other. It was a little club. There were these Jewish guys, really, who understood how to make the schmat to business wear and everything else.

[00:26:40.450] - Speaker 1
They had it in their blood to make it work. So we found one of these guys in Oakland. We went over to his warehouse and started to look around.

[00:26:49.110] - Speaker 2
Describe the whole warehouse for me. I'm interested in that.

[00:26:52.330] - Speaker 1
It's Dunk. It was full of mold and sweating clothes that had never been washed and greasy stuff. But it was- Was it orderly or no? They sorted it out. They did sort it out. And so over here was some shirts, all polished shirts.

[00:27:11.240] - Speaker 2
Was it all military stuff or not necessarily?

[00:27:13.640] - Speaker 1
All excess. They were buying from the military. That's where they were buying it. And they were buying it from all these auctions. They would go around the country and bid against each other. And then they would trade afterwards. From my lot, I'll trade you this and I'll trade you that. We didn't have the money to do that. We didn't We have the wearwithal to do that. That wasn't what we wanted. We wanted to find clothes.

[00:27:33.990] - Speaker 2
And that was a bigger scale than what you were doing.

[00:27:35.950] - Speaker 1
We wanted to just sell clothes. Other people, well, if you can buy a surplus jacket, these were the polyester clothing ears. So these were the natural fibers, the only way you could find natural fibers. These were the days when designers weren't really designing anything particularly great, but throwing their names all over them. My sense of fashion is the next available thing off the rack in the closet. I didn't think about fashion. But Patricia, she did.

[00:28:07.250] - Speaker 2
Were most of the things that you saw either khaki or olive green?

[00:28:13.740] - Speaker 1
Yes. Almost everything was cacquy or olive green. Some version of both. It was a textile if it was a garment. But what we found in this warehouse was a whole pile of shirts with epelettes on them that looked fantastic. There were these Epaulets. These were the '70s. We wore epelettes, beautiful safari-kind of shirts. We asked, Where did these come from? Spanish? Yeah, the Spanish Army shirts. They were paratrooper shirts. Spanish paratrooper shirts? Oh, interesting. How much? Five dollars a piece. Patricia nudges me. We just walk away. She's good at this. She said, Well, what? How much did they have? There were about 500 of them because that's what we bought them all. And that's what there were, 500 Spanish paratrooper shirts. I don't know how or why I was driving a Pinto in those days, but we had a Pinto, and We drove up to the warehouse and loaded the whole back of the Pinto with these 500. By the way, it was $5. No. How about a dollar? How about anything up to $2, whatever it was per shirt. That's right, because it was $1,000 and we had $500 left. There it was. So we drove them back to our house in Mill Valley at that time.

[00:29:37.780] - Speaker 1
We were renting a house and started washing them one at a time, one at a time, one at a time, one at a time. We had a dinner party. Some friends were over, and one of our friends was one of my best friends over the years, Herbert Gold, who was a novelist who, if you haven't read his book, Fathers, is one of the greatest books of all time in the 1950s. He wrote that book. He was mentored by Saul Bello, and he was of that same. He's written many books. He just died at 99 recently, dear friend. He was at the dinner, and he's a goodwill. He No spend on money. He's just a Bohemian. He was a Beatnik of the Beatnik era in San Francisco. He walked downstairs. Then he brought one of his shirts up. He looked at each other, what is this? Patricia said, well, it's a Spanish paratroop shirt. He said, I want one. I said, take one her. And she said, 650. How can you charge my friend money for a shirt anyway? Oh, yeah. He preeps on This checkbook, you write six times. Was that his first sale? That was their first sale.

[00:30:47.590] - Speaker 1
Oh, great. His first sale. Then he puts it on. This is hilarious. Then he puts it on and the sleeves came to here. They were short. Three quarters sleeve. I don't think it was meant to be that. It was surplus because it was too short because he went down and found five more and they were all the same. Now we knew why it was surplus.

[00:31:09.490] - Speaker 2
Because they didn't fit.

[00:31:10.620] - Speaker 1
Didn't fit. We thought, This is crazy. What are we going to do? I said, Well, we're going to sell a short-arm Spanish parachute pursuit. That's what we own. This is probably because Franco had this crazy idea that he didn't want any long-arm people around. We made up some fun stuff and wrote some copy about it. At that point, there was a flea market in Marine City. They had a big, dirty, open lot there. Every Saturday, they had a flea market in. It was a huge flea market. So I said, We're We go to the flea market and sell our short-arm Spanish paratrooper shirts. So we go there the first day, and we have a sign, Short-Arm Spanish Paratrooper Shirt, 695 or whatever it was, 650. People are fascinated with it. They're just fascinated with it. They're coming by and looking at it. By the end of the day, we sold three of them. So what are we doing wrong? Patricia said, They're too cheap. So the next week, we went back and doubled the price and sold out. Then we began to realize, Well, we're in the strangest of strange businesses. We're buying surplus. There can be incredible margins in this business.

[00:32:28.760] - Speaker 2
Most people in business school would tell you, if you raise the prices, you'll sell less.

[00:32:32.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. This was the first reason that we knew that the best asset we had is having no experience whatsoever.

[00:32:40.670] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.

[00:32:42.280] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. We were professional amateurs, and I've been one ever since because of that.

[00:32:49.630] - Speaker 2
How did she get the idea to double the price?

[00:32:51.870] - Speaker 1
She was interested in fashion. She worked at Macy's when it was a real store in the 1960s on Union in San Francisco. She worked under some people in the fashion department just helping to buy. She was very aware of the fashion world. I had zero visibility to it, but she could see it. I would never I've known that.

[00:33:15.800] - Speaker 2
No, it's fascinating.

[00:33:16.970] - Speaker 1
Well, look at today, look at the price of some of the clothing that's out there with certain label names on it. Do you really think that's not a 90% margin? It's absolutely a This is public theory, but look at how many happy people who have been stolen from. I mean, it's just crazy. It's crazy. It's because this whole world we live in now is about manufactured scarcity. Anyway, so that became it. We got enough money to open a little store on a side street in Mill Valley, $250 a month. The only thing is we couldn't lock the door because there was a Niketo studio upstairs, and we had to let people come in for evening classes. So we had a store with all our merchandise in it. Well, we couldn't like the door. People had to walk in and out all night, even though we weren't there. But it was 1970s.

[00:34:13.550] - Speaker 2
What did you name the first store?

[00:34:15.450] - Speaker 1
The name was Banana Republic.

[00:34:17.290] - Speaker 2
So Banana Republic, the first $250 a month store was Banana Republic. That was the beginning. That was it.

[00:34:24.510] - Speaker 1
The reason I named it Banana Republic is I knew it would get noticed because you just didn't name stores Banana Republic in those days. That was not what you did. And it was making a political statement on top of everything else, which I wasn't going to leave the rest of me behind to go into the fashion business. Patricia wasn't going to leave the rest of her behind. So we went into it as a writer and an artist. And when we look back now from where we are and look at it, in the early years before it was destroyed by the Gap, there was nothing quite like it. It was It was all about creativity. Just do anything. Just make it fun and make it true, make it honest. Just no limits. If you can imagine it, you can do it.

[00:35:11.780] - Speaker 2
Think and grow rich.

[00:35:13.320] - Speaker 1
Because we were who we were, we were drawn to other unemployment people who were just amazing when you hired them. And so the whole thing became wacky and creative, and the catalog Catalogs were just, I don't know if you ever remember them in the 1980s. Each one of them was lovingly created. We never ran a photograph. Patricia, in the beginning, is an artist. We couldn't afford a photographer. So the first catalog, she would draw it.

[00:35:45.400] - Speaker 2
So illustrated clothing with a description.

[00:35:48.860] - Speaker 1
With a literary description. I was a writer. This is what I did. So this is the only place we felt comfortable. We didn't know anything else, but we did know how to write the copy, and we did know how to do How much do you think the combination of the illustrations and the copy sold versus the item itself?

[00:36:09.060] - Speaker 2
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:36:10.360] - Speaker 1
Well, it was a unique experience because some of the items were a Swedish army gas mask bag without the gas mask. Now, would you buy that because it was written about or would you say, I have to own one of these things? But everything had its story. There was a story for everything.

[00:36:32.570] - Speaker 2
Everything, it sounds like, was limited because- It was genuinely limited because it was surplus.

[00:36:37.620] - Speaker 1
When it was gone- You would buy 500 or 1,000, and when those were gone, you didn't have that anymore. Gone.

[00:36:43.900] - Speaker 2
It was always turning over. That would be another reason for people to either check out the catalog or come to the shop is because everything was going to be different next time.

[00:36:54.220] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. Everything was new. The unique things we were finding, the way we were doing, we were, well, okay, there was a British Army sleeping bags, but they had sheepskin liners. So we stripped the sheepskin out of them with sheepskin vests. Yeah.

[00:37:11.960] - Speaker 2
Would you ever dye them or do anything with them?

[00:37:14.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Later on, we dye everything. We had all kinds of colors. We dye everything. Not in the early years because we didn't have the money to do it. But when we had the resources to do it, we would have done all that earlier. We were working with what we had. And there were basically the two of us doing everything in the from the beginning, stapling the catalogs at the kitchen table, hand printing them. How many catalogs?

[00:37:35.180] - Speaker 2
First catalog, how many print?

[00:37:36.680] - Speaker 1
Five hundred.

[00:37:39.020] - Speaker 2
Where would you distribute them?

[00:37:40.800] - Speaker 1
Well, I come from media, so I knew the only way I was going to make this thing work is to get attention. I sent it to every city desk, to every newspaper, to every magazine, to everywhere I possibly could, hoping somebody would open it and realize, Banana Republic, look at this crazy thing. Look at this copy. It so happened it landed one day on the desk of John Gambling, W-O-R Radio, New York, Tri-state area, broadcasting. A huge listenership. Broadcasting Patricia, one day, we're desperately... It's raining. Nobody's coming in the store in Mill Valley. She goes in to open the store. She picks up the phone. We were so desperate that she would try to take wrong numbers and turn them into sales. And this happened to be, Hello, who am I talking to? Patricia. And who is this? John Gambling in your On The Air, W-O-R, New York.

[00:38:43.920] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:38:45.090] - Speaker 1
That's how it happened.

[00:38:46.300] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:38:47.380] - Speaker 1
It was amazing. She's funny and she's great, and she told wonderful stories, and she describes some of the crazy merchandise. And he said at the end, Well, how does somebody get one of these things? And because We manufactured 500 of them and they were expensive. We decided we're going to sell them for a dollar. We sold the catalog for a dollar. It was a literary beautiful catalog. So Patricia said, Send a dollar to post office box 745 Mill Valley, Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We were right across from the post office. Four days later, the postman walks over with two sacs of meal. Every one of them had a dollar in it.

[00:39:27.290] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:39:28.590] - Speaker 1
That was it. From that, we never raised any other money. It was our $1,500. We were working on cash flow, although I wouldn't even know what it was then. It was just, Let's open 25 envelopes and go to dinner.

[00:39:43.060] - Speaker 2
Tell me more about the name, about how much thought went into the name.

[00:39:50.220] - Speaker 1
Well, I knew it was naughty. I just knew it was naughty. I didn't know what. I just knew it was going to get attention. I had to get attention It was controversial. I had no other money. It was controversial. I had to get attention. I mean, I realized later on that I'm a marketing guy. This is what I do. I knew how to do it. It was innate to me. Yes.

[00:40:11.550] - Speaker 2
Walk me through the growth of the company. The next step, people are ordering catalogs.

[00:40:16.920] - Speaker 1
Ordering catalogs. What happens next? Well, we need help. We're doing this all ourselves. A beautiful woman walked in, just shopping and just said, Are you hiring? Patricia said, Yeah, but I can only pay you $5 an hour. I said, It's okay. She came in and we had an employee. That was your first employee? We had a store manager. It was happening.

[00:40:39.750] - Speaker 2
Did you have a lot of repeat customers?

[00:40:41.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah, they were really people who were devoted to it. A lot of creative Mostly created.

[00:40:47.650] - Speaker 2
Did you put a Banana Republic label in the clothing?

[00:40:49.570] - Speaker 1
Oh, yes. Banana Republic. From the beginning. From the beginning, it said Banana Republic. And not only that, but the original logo were two bananas and a star, a red star, because I remember that, particularly because after a while, I realized we could probably get a bankload. We went to the local place that had our checking account, and we met Fred, the known officer, and he looked at this. He said, Well, you have a business card? Look at the business card with this red star in the middle of it. I said, Oh, no, we're just making up this name. We had to explain it to him. We talked to him, we talked to him, we talked to him. He says, Well, look, here's how you get credit. You got to have capacity capacity, which is basically collateral. There were three Cs. I'm forgetting what the third C was. You have to have character. He said, Well, you don't have those other Cs, but you are sure two characters. He said, Well, I tell you, have you thought about Net 30? Asking your suppliers for Net 30? I said, What's that? And that's what happened. We financed through Net 30, which then became Net-60 and Net-90.

[00:42:00.690] - Speaker 1
We always paid early. And years later, when we walked around before the company really evolved into more broadly, we would show up at the surplus conventions in place in Las Vegas. And these were other people with army and navy stories. How the hell you guys do this. Because we were just selling in this fashion. We were just selling in this fun. Because this is what we wore, this is what we did. We don't live in boxes.

[00:42:26.230] - Speaker 2
Yeah. You framed it as a different thing than army surplus. Yes. Because there are plenty army surplus stores, but Banana Republic wasn't an army surplus store, even though you sold army surplus.

[00:42:37.800] - Speaker 1
It was army surplus.

[00:42:39.080] - Speaker 2
It starts with just the clothing, and then over time, you would start dying it. What other modifications would you do? You said you would take something apart.

[00:42:47.070] - Speaker 1
Well, we knew we were selling a lot of khaki, so we couldn't manufacture. We didn't have enough money to really even manufacture at that point. We were getting all the surplus we could, and we were running low on some things. So we would go and find a company that was making natural fabrics and making things in khaki. And we would say, well, could you just take that shirt and change these buttons and make a few of these for us? Or could you just do this and put a label on that pant? And that's how we expanded. And that's how we began to do more. But we still didn't have the money to die. I'll never forget the moment when we got that idea. I was in Lower Broadway in New York. I was there visiting Patricia was back in Mill Valley at the store. And there was a store, I forget the name of it. It was a wonderful store that was on Lower Broadway. There's something clothing. But what they did is they took everything and they died it in these outrageous colors. And I walked into that store. I said, this is what we should be doing.

[00:43:55.230] - Speaker 1
I went out to a phone booth, a noisy, I brought foreign stuff. I called Patricia. She said, Hey, what's up? I said, Diet, diet, diet, diet. She said, Are you saying I'm fat? Are you telling me? She was joking, but she It was a challenge because we had more than- What was the first thing that you manufactured yourself?

[00:44:19.320] - Speaker 2
Or did you ever get to that stage?

[00:44:20.570] - Speaker 1
Well, here's what happened. The deficit began to show. I had no interest in business. I had no education in business. And Patricia, neither. We were just two creative people bumbling along through this whole thing. And we had some customers who just loved what we were doing. And there was a fellow by the name of Merritt Scher who who lived in Moraine County, who was a shopping center developer. And he came in often and he said, I want to put one of these in my shopping center. This is great. And I couldn't even imagine how I was going to do that. Nobody loaned money to... I mean, people today could not possibly understand what it was like in the 1970s. Venture capital, if anything, was for a few little companies making chips in Silicon Valley. The very idea of financing a brand or a clothing, nobody would do anything. That was just ridiculous. And then particularly one named Banana Republic. I mean, this was too dissonant, even for those times. And Marriott would come in. I said, Marriott, I can't. We don't have the capacity to do it. We don't have the money. I just can't do it.

[00:45:37.100] - Speaker 1
We're not sleeping. We're filling orders at night, we're just in the store. We're trying to make this thing happen. We're writing the catalog. I mean, those days, you had to set the catalog in a line of type. It was crazy. Patricia was so tired. One night she was driving past after three nights of no sleep over the Golden Gate Bridge and swerved into the other lane. Wow. We were How many years in were you now? We were now four years in. And we were doing it for us. We could travel. But we weren't really making any money. We had two stores. I said, take a day off, just go walk in the mountain, just walk in the mountain. And I went and I meditated. I didn't know I was meditating, but I was actually letting my mind just go free. And I thought, the only solution here is not to close the catalog or not to close the store, but to grow. Pretty obvious, but for an intelligent person, I was pretty stupid. I didn't see that. But then when I saw that, okay, so she said, what do you... So I came back and I said, here's the solution.

[00:46:39.870] - Speaker 1
We're going to open a second store. She said, what? We're going to get another store in San Francisco. So we did. We went, we opened the store in San Francisco, and it was gangbusters. It was people loved it. It was on Polk Street between Pacific Heights and Russian Hill. And we did really well in there.

[00:46:58.650] - Speaker 2
Is the store still there?

[00:47:00.190] - Speaker 1
No, it's long gone. So we still all we wanted to do was travel, and we were bone tired. And so our friend Marriott said, Well, come to my shopping center and put this in. I said, not only can I do it, but I'd sell this company tomorrow if I could. He said, well, you ought to meet Don Fisher. Well, Don Fisher is the guy who started The Gap. He started The Gap maybe 10 years earlier in San by selling Levi's and records. The Gap was the thing from the 1960s, the Generation Gap. Remember that?

[00:47:40.450] - Speaker 2
I didn't know that's what the Gap was.

[00:47:42.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was named after the Don't trust anybody over 30. By that point, the Gap had 500 stores. It was a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.

[00:47:52.290] - Speaker 2
Were they still only selling Levi's?

[00:47:54.370] - Speaker 1
No, by that point, they were- They had switched to Gap. They were in malls. They were manufacturing clothes with a lot of different labels in it, none of which said Gap. They were putting them on these rounders, and nothing was on the wall and on shelves. It was just clothes in a white space, call a store in a mall. He walks into this store, and he's, Don Fisher. He was an exceptional person, I will say. He really was an exceptional person. Very bright, very smart. Real estate was his background. But he found his way into the clothing business through real estate. And he started walking around the store and picking up things and says, What's this? And the salesperson would say, Well, that's a Falkland Islands bathing suit from the British surplus from the Falkland Islands. What? He would look at this and he would look at... He started looking at every item and reading the tab and reading the letters. We used to post all the letters people sent us in the dressing rooms. They were all posted over the walls because people were just loved the company and they just sent us love letters all the time, and we just posted them.

[00:49:04.650] - Speaker 2
That's a nice idea.

[00:49:05.910] - Speaker 1
He said, Yeah, he was interested. He actually wanted to buy the company. And he said, Let's have lunch. Let's go around the block. There was a place to have lunch. He brought his CFO with him. Then he got in drilling down questions. He said, Well, where are you incorporated? I said, Well, I don't know. I incorporated myself. I figured out how to incorporate you. Are you an accountant? I'm the accountant. I did everything. I was the lawyer. I was the accountant. I did everything. I couldn't owe money for this stuff. Do it yourself. It was mom and pop. This is a mom and pop business. He said, Well, what do you do for markdowns? Patricia said, We don't. We mark them up. He said, What are your margins? He said, not 80%, 90%. You're lying. This was the CFO. He was like, You're lying. The truth is we didn't really know our margins because we couldn't even keep inventory. We didn't have the capacity to even keep inventory. We were just buying surplus. This is probably what we should charge selling it. It was just all on. We were just going. We were in motion.

[00:50:16.890] - Speaker 1
There was no way out of this thing except through it. It wasn't getting us anywhere yet because everything was going wrong all the time, and we had to be there to fix it. Anyway, out of that, somehow or another, we ended up selling the company to the Gap.

[00:50:35.430] - Speaker 2
Was it a good thing to do? Was it a bad thing to do? Tell me more about that.

[00:50:38.700] - Speaker 1
That question, from where I am today, it was It was the great thing to do because my life took the best turn ever. The best turn. It was the great thing to do from a business perspective. It was insane. We did everything wrong. Everything wrong from protecting our asset, from getting the value that we really created. Everything wrong. I thought, well, I'm going to get a lawyer to help us. So how do I go find a lawyer? I ask my friend Herb Gold for a lawyer, and who does he pick? He has this friend, Bernard Petrie, who's just this wonderful human being, but he's the strangest human being. I put him up against the gap, and he tries to do the best he can, but he knows about as much about business as we do, even though he's 10 years older than we are. And even though his father was a Cleveland Taylor who started a chain called Petrie Stores, which is a massive chain, he's the son of this Man, once sat next to dinner at, who knew the sales in every one of his 1,213 stores the day before when he was 85 years old.

[00:51:53.800] - Speaker 1
So you can imagine what his son, who didn't want to be that man, he was our lawyer. Yeah. Yeah. Lovely. We loved them. Whenever we negotiated, we negotiated, and it was okay. It was enough money. I forget. We're going to go. We had enough to travel. We're going to do it. The last minute, Don Fisher is shrewd. He says, I can't do this. Why can't you do this? He says, I can't do this because I wouldn't know what to do with this company. I said, Well, we're not looking for a job. I'm not talking about a job. I said, You just show me how this company could be profitable. I'll give you whatever you need to make it be profitable. And I'll give you a percentage of the sales, gross margin, whatever it was down the line. So we looked at each other at that point. Although The card wasn't very expensive, we hired a CPA from Arthur Anderson who was going. And we had owed about $50,000 in fees, which we didn't have. And I didn't know whether to sell or whether or not. But he said, I I promise you, I won't interfere.

[00:53:03.320] - Speaker 1
This is your company. You do whatever you want. I don't care. It's yours. Just slugs is profitable. Patricia and I talked about it, and ultimately, I was like, well, maybe maybe. And she was, Let's do it. So we did it. Then with funds, we began to really start to have fun. Of course, Don would in and he says, Well, why don't you make jeans in khaki? We said, no, Don, we don't do that. In other words, there was a tester of two. And then he really did retreat. He didn't do anything except support us in every single way. And we grew the company for years doing that, but we weren't fitting into a regimen. Something was wrong.

[00:53:51.330] - Speaker 2
How much longer did you stay at the company after this?

[00:53:52.930] - Speaker 1
We were there for another... Basically, it was almost five years owning it and four years with the gap. He was true to his word until he wasn't. It was a good experience. It was a good experience.

[00:54:06.660] - Speaker 2
How much did the company grow over that four years?

[00:54:09.410] - Speaker 1
In those four years, we opened 50 stores, I think, and we had a circulation of 30 million catalogs, which was just a lot in those days. Something a lot, I think. I forget exactly what the number. I can't recall. 50 or 60 stores.

[00:54:23.630] - Speaker 2
Were you still writing the copy for the catalogs?

[00:54:25.250] - Speaker 1
By that point, we had a creative department, and they were amazing. They were just amazing. We hired people who, as I said, could never get a job anywhere else. But in that play pen, they were in that play pen. They had so much fun. They took the way Patricia drew, and they took the way I wrote, and they just- Amplified it. Much better than we ever could. I mean, they're just beautiful. They did a beautiful job. And that went out for a while. And it was fun. And we traveled and found things, and we did unusual things at that point. We became Well, we would go to Italy. We would pass by something that was a restaurant trade show. What's in there? And we go into the restaurant trade show and say, Look at those jackets, Italian waiter jackets. Wow, those are really cool Italian waiter jackets. We would buy 10,000 Italian waiter jackets and dye them all different colors. The vendor would say, How many restaurants do you have? But we We would do things like that. We would fly to Israel and find Israeli army paratrooper bags or something like that. We would get a prototype of it and send it back and make more of those things.

[00:55:44.480] - Speaker 1
We would go to England.

[00:55:45.680] - Speaker 2
But you would manufacture to match the surplus as well.

[00:55:48.600] - Speaker 1
As much as we could. Or we went, for instance, in England, we found a man by the name of Mr. Braided. Mr. Braided would make these beautiful bags, these khaki leather bags that the fishermen used. They never broke. No matter how many years later, if you send it back to Mr. Braided, he would fix it. We would ask Mr. Braided if he would make some bags for us and change this and change that. Mr. Braided would make some bags for us, and we would sell those bags as part of the catalog and things like that. We did that, a lot of that, everywhere we could.

[00:56:23.290] - Speaker 2
Would you say it still felt like your company for those four years?

[00:56:26.700] - Speaker 1
It was entirely our company. It was It wasn't kicking out enough money for them to worry about the analysts. It wasn't really kicking out earnings yet because their volume was so big. It's only when it began to get that way, Were they helpful in terms of opening stores or other things? The real estate, they had a real estate Department. Yes, that we relied. They helped us build the stores. That was a machine. They knew how to do that. But we, And again, there was a little bit of conflict because what Dawn liked was mall stores. I said, I don't really shop in malls. I like street stores. And so we got as many street stores as we could. If there weren't that many, but we would find street locations that we really loved and thought this is the right place to put a store and build a store there. But no two stores were alike. That was the rule. No two stores were alike. This one's going to be a safari camp. This one's going to be an embassy. We were always playing with the metaphor. We were always inside this apocryphal country called Banana Republic, and everything was about that.

[00:57:43.330] - Speaker 1
The gift boxes were Monster, Rhinoceroses. The gift paper was the Banana Republican newspaper. Every single thing, we had a climate desk, and you could call the climate desk and hear what the climate was going to be, where you were going to go. I don't know people today listening to this and thinking, how could there have been a life without Internet? There was no Internet. In the initial days, those catalogs, we had to get an order form in there, put an 800 number. And if you wanted to order from us. You had to either call the 800 number and give us your credit card, or you went out and got a stamp, found a post box, dropped it in the mail. That's how you ordered.

[00:58:27.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:58:28.940] - Speaker 1
We're dinosaurs today.

[00:58:32.210] - Speaker 2
It's a great story.

[00:58:34.330] - Speaker 1
It was fun.

[00:58:35.500] - Speaker 2
Then what happened at the end of the four years?

[00:58:38.020] - Speaker 1
At the end of the four years, a stock market event called Black Monday. The gap had reported earnings maybe a month earlier, and they missed earnings, and the stock fell a lot. Then on Black Monday, it fell 50%.

[00:58:58.270] - Speaker 2
Did that happen just to the Gap or to the market in general?

[00:59:00.680] - Speaker 1
It happened while we were having a conference somewhere at the Claremont Hotel with all our store managers, and I went out and saw this Black Monday headline. I had no idea.

[00:59:08.520] - Speaker 2
I'm saying did Black Monday only impact the gap, or was it across the board?

[00:59:13.510] - Speaker 1
Across the board. The market. The market dropped. It was one of the biggest crashes of all times. Black Monday, 1987.

[00:59:22.060] - Speaker 2
The market changed. It wasn't that the gap failed in that moment.

[00:59:26.720] - Speaker 1
No, it wasn't the gap. The market failed. It was the market. But the gap... But Everything went down with the sinking shit, and they had already gone down. So they were down once and now down again, and they panicked. And the analysts, at that point, they were trying to say, Look, we have Banana Republic. It's coming up. It's We're making really great, blah, blah, blah. The analysts were saying, this safari thing can be nothing more than a trend. And to us, it was the most ridiculous thing ever that we weren't safari any longer. We were travel clothing, and we were really functional travel clothing, buttons that buttoned to something, zippers that worked. Everything was functional and beautiful and exquisite fabrics, natural fabrics. We really were. But at that point, they decided, Well, things like this. This is the things that would happen. We'd have a shirt, a beautiful Indian cotton shirt, and we'd sell it season after season. We would change colors. It would be great. Patricia, at one point said, This is getting old. We got to change it. Well, the data Monsters at the Gap said, How do you throw out an item that is selling this tonnage?

[01:00:49.300] - Speaker 1
You can't really... She would have to argue. They were suddenly now an argument. We would still throw the thing out of the catalog. It didn't matter. But now there was an argument, and that It didn't work for us. This isn't what we bought into. The good fortune was that for many years we were trying to have a baby, and we did. And my son was born, and I was already 43 years old. We had just signed a huge contract for lots of money. I said, I'm not doing this. I don't care. We have enough. We left. That's what happened. And it was strange. All of a sudden, your progeny was gone. They killed everything. They killed the catalog. They killed the magazine that was going up. They changed the clothes. For years, customers were furious. Then they hired creative people, people who posed to know what they were doing, and they made it even worse.

[01:01:51.110] - Speaker 2
Professionals.

[01:01:52.060] - Speaker 1
Professionals, right. That's what happened. And it took them many, many years. In fact, I would say because of the way it all happened, it wasn't really... It wasn't classey. I didn't like that, the way that the exit happened. I just never really looked back at it. But finally, now, I can see, I've been noticing that they're coming back to the roots of the company, but more from a 21st century standpoint. They're trying to regenerate the products that were there. I think there's some pretty nice things that they have. I haven't really looked at it, but people have brought my attention to it. Interesting to relive all that.

[01:02:41.950] - Speaker 2
Then you started your life of meditation and being a father.

[01:02:48.090] - Speaker 1
I still do love being a father. I'm a writer, and I have been working on a book forever that someday I'll publish is called Bringing Up Dad. They raised me. They really did. They still raising me. Even in the '30s, they're raising me. But this is it. I started to study Daoism, and I was fascinated. I would fly to the England just to get into the British Museum to read these texts. I couldn't find it. I was really into it. I was trying to crack my mind. I wanted to think in a completely different way or not think at all. It took a long time.

[01:03:32.020] - Speaker 2
What do you think the breakthrough was?

[01:03:34.570] - Speaker 1
I don't even know. I began to see a lot of pain around me that was unnecessary pain, a lot of conflict that was around me that was unnecessary conflict. I tried to navigate through it, bumbling my way through it. I can't say with a lot of wisdom, but it's saying, why? Why? I don't believe that you can change the world except one person at a time. That's my philosophy. If I'm a example, somebody else might be a good example. That's about it. Nothing I say, nothing I write is going to do anything except move people in their own internal way, hopefully closer. And that's where I'm at. Then about 30 years ago, I took up painting. Loved to paint. Loved to paint. And my son is a painter. My wife is a painter. My daughter is a fashion designer. When there were kids, we bought the house across the driveway from us that was being sold by a Marion County judge, a very sweet man, and it became our art house. So we would go over there just to create art together. Fantastic. Family Studio. It was so great. It was so beautiful. We have these art sitting there, and each one of us would be doing our own thing.

[01:04:54.480] - Speaker 1
And I was playing like they were learning like they were learning. And I've been doing it ever since. And in the last several years, it's really matured. But I didn't try to make a career out of it. It felt like I couldn't really go out there. I just love doing it.

[01:05:12.340] - Speaker 2
Do you listen to music when you paint?

[01:05:13.830] - Speaker 1
Oh, yes. You'll see Vivaldi all over it. I mean, it's everywhere. I mean, in everything, but not just Vivaldi. But I mean, there's something about Vivaldi. Yes. In fact, Patricia calls my paintings very musical. She She says, I'm very musical. I have no music training, just as I hear you have me. Me neither. I heard. It's amazing. It's inside me is music.

[01:05:39.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you can feel it.

[01:05:40.540] - Speaker 1
I feel it. Me too.

[01:05:43.160] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Republic of Tea.

[01:05:45.840] - Speaker 1
I wanted to learn about tea. I'm that person. If I want to learn about something, I just jump in. My path into tea was flavor black teas were magical for me for a And then I just got more into the quimons, the more Chinese, deep tasting Chinese teas. But I saw a hole in the market that was unbelievable. This was the early '90s. It didn't matter what restaurant you went to. If you ordered a tea, they would bring you out a Lipton's tea bag. How could this be? I saw that. And on the other hand, there was a hippie brand called Celestial Seasonings from a guy named Mo Siegel, and lived in Colorado. It was beautiful. It had all these different herbal things. And other than that, there was a sprinkling in there, maybe a brand called Twinings and a few other things, but nothing, nobody was really revering tea. And so I thought this is- And historically, tea has been revered. Yes, it's the, I call it the second oldest product in the world. And the nuances are fantastic, just like wine. It I've never really... It still hasn't come fully realized. But at that point, that's why, again, I didn't realize what we were doing.

[01:07:09.120] - Speaker 1
How did it start? We were creating a category. We weren't creating a company because now if you go into a store It's all there. So I went to a... This is a year or so, two years after Banana Republic of my doing nothing years, which was dense with study and writing and travel and things. But I went to a conference, a group called the Social Venture Network that was just starting up somewhere in New Jersey. It was the first time I really left my son, who was maybe then two years old. I left the conference early and I started flying back. A young guy there saw me at the conference, chased me down and found me on the plane and started talking to me. He knew that I had started Banana Republic. And for some reason, I mentioned to him, if I were to ever start another company, it would be a tea company. And he was all over it. He was all over it. He really thought this was the greatest idea ever. And I said, okay. But I wasn't sure about him. I wasn't sure whether... I didn't know. Having gone through, I would say it wasn't a pleasant experience at the end of Banana Republic, so I didn't need this.

[01:08:33.870] - Speaker 1
Look, my goal is never to be rich or wealthy. I just want to be independent. And I had enough to be independent. And so I wasn't really looking at this point to do anything. But he was very engaging and smart. And I just happened to say, I just get these names just come to me. I said, If there's another company, I'm going to call the Republic of tea, and I'm going to be the Minister of Leaves.

[01:09:02.410] - Speaker 2
Was that the first time you said it? Yes.

[01:09:05.100] - Speaker 1
I'm going to be the Minister of Leaves, which I love because I'm not only leaving, but I'm the Minister of Leaves. It's like, it's okay. I did. I appointed myself Minister. He said, Well, I'll be the Minister of Progress. And he really started banging together. And these were the years when there were the fax machines. I go home the next morning and my fax machine is chattering in my study. And he's saying, the Minister of Progress, we could This way, and I would answer him. And we would go back and forth with faxes, back and forth with faxes. I had another friend who came over one day and he saw this pile of faxes. I didn't know whether I was going to start it with this guy. I wasn't going to start it with this guy. I didn't know what I was doing. I was I was laying out the idea of what should a tea company be? I was imagining it. And a friend of mine came over, a friend by the name of Bruce Katz, who started Rockport. He unfortunately recently died, fell from roof, miss him dearly. Came to my house one day, and I had these things naturally came printed out.

[01:10:08.640] - Speaker 1
So he saw this pile of stuff. He started reading through and he said, This is great. You should publish this. So he knew somebody who knew somebody. And the next thing I knew, I had an editor from Doubledee who was visiting, and she read it and she wanted to publish it. So she published the complete exchange of how to start a business, Republic of Tee, Letters to a young zentrepreneur or something. I forget what the subtitle was. It was changed along the way. I just didn't want to tear myself away from my son.

[01:10:41.730] - Speaker 2
You sound like someone who, when you dive in, you were all consumed. So you were wary of becoming all consumed again.

[01:10:52.030] - Speaker 1
That's exactly right. I understand. But I waited for my Minister of Progress to see what he What are you going to do and make it happen. He was not quite making it happen until they gave us a book advance. And so since we were both writing these faxes back and forth together, it was really our book. It wasn't my book. It was our book. So I said, The only way I'm going to do this company is if you start it with the book advance. I thought, That would be great. Just take the book advance and start the company. And he did. He basically started the company with the book advance and a little help from another friend of ours. And we were able to build that a couple of years. And again, I was operating, but it wasn't the same, and I didn't want to operate. So we ended up selling it a couple of years later to a lovely family.

[01:11:46.360] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the years of doing it. What was the process?

[01:11:51.920] - Speaker 1
The process was creating different brands of tea and working with the herbs or working with the dark tees and creating flavored tees, and then somehow creating a way of packaging that was going to be different. It had to be different because it couldn't be just another tea company. So we came up with the idea that, and nobody had ever done this before, that teabags were square. Let's make them round. Okay. And what about the can? The The can has to be round for that to go into. And what would be on the can would be these exceptional names and stories and witticisms from the Minister of Leaves or anybody else. And so we use the The Cans, basically, to advertise a life of sip by sip as opposed to gulp by gulp. I mean, it's always fun to create a villain, and the villain here was the gulpers. You really can get your teeth into something if you have something to work off of. It was this people- We're not like them. We're not going to gulp and mis light. We're just going to gulp our way through life. We're going to sip our way, sip by sip by sip by sip.

[01:13:13.230] - Speaker 1
We created just really lovely tees and learned a lot and tried to make them more... Earl gray was the Earl Grayer, for instance. I mean, that was the name of that tea. I forget a lot of the other names, but I think we probably should have opened stores But we had another problem.

[01:13:30.600] - Speaker 2
I was going to ask if you ever considered- We wanted to. If you would have opened shops, would it have been a store to buy the tea, or would it have been more like the Starbucks of tea?

[01:13:42.380] - Speaker 1
It would have been the Starbucks of tea. Still no one's done it. In fact, Howard Schultz found us early on, and he had already thrown tea out of the Starbucks in those years and was trying to find a way back in. There was a time when I thought he might buy the company. We flew up to see him, and one of my partners is a good talker, but not a great listener. At that point, my dear friend, at that point, there were some sparks that were wrong between Howard and him, and it never really worked. I said, Let's sell this thing to somebody who can really make something out of it. There was this fellow in St. Louis by the name of Ron Rubin. He was in the beverage business. His family was in the beverage business, bottle beverage business. He read the book, and he flew out to meet us, and he said, I'd love to buy this company. I just really liked him. To this day, they run that company. Company from the book. He'll say on page 276. We were just wild ideas that we threw out.

[01:14:51.370] - Speaker 2
It's a beautiful story. I've never heard a story like that before.

[01:14:55.150] - Speaker 1
Really?

[01:14:55.930] - Speaker 2
No, where the idea phase is documented and ending up becoming exposed in advance of the actual product. There was no Republic of Tea. We always hear the story after. We've never heard the wild ideas of what this thing could be in print and then have that thing actually come into existence. That's a very unusual story.

[01:15:27.380] - Speaker 1
Interesting. Yeah, it was fully imagined. Of course, in 5, 30 years later, it's still evolving, but the core of it, the culture of it.

[01:15:35.270] - Speaker 2
The philosophy of it was in the book.

[01:15:37.420] - Speaker 1
It was there. I mean, if the Gap had done this with Banana Republic, they would have a wildly successful company. If they had just done this, They didn't have the courage to do this. But if they did this, it was so classic. I mean, we owned Cackey, but we weren't all about Cackey, but we earned Cackey and we owned the practicality and functional clothing that stood apart from all the design. The opposite experience happened with the Republic of T. There's good evidence. No, it's not. Republic of T is not amalgamated, gigantic like the gap. But when is enough enough? In this world, I don't think people ask that question enough.

[01:16:25.980] - Speaker 2
Tell me more about your spiritual life.

[01:16:29.060] - Speaker 1
I paint. I can't start a painting until I accept and enter the emptyness, the blank canvas, the silence. When I do that, then I'm always excited to start. Something draws me to a color. Something draws me to a brush. Something draws me to a stroke. Everything, once it starts, becomes resolution. It's all just resolving.

[01:17:03.460] - Speaker 2
You're reacting to something that you see?

[01:17:06.410] - Speaker 1
I'm responding to the materials. I'm responding to the choices that I made earlier. I'm always in response. I'm not really generating. I'm responding, and I'm listening. To me, that's what empties me out. And in the end, sometimes when I finish a work, I look at it. It's abstract work, very colorful, because there's so much vividness in what happens. I see something that's familiar. It's some a structure that... That existed, and it came out and it showed itself to me. I didn't do that. It showed itself to me. It's so energizing. I meditate. I do sit down and meditate Every morning, I do my best to do that. I stretch. I love yoga. We have a little yoga room where we do our stretches and things like that. But if you ask about my spiritual life, I would have to say I try to weave that into every moment and often make a mess out of it.

[01:18:20.530] - Speaker 2
How do you know when a painting is done? And do you know for sure when it's done?

[01:18:25.820] - Speaker 1
It's never done. I've gone back and repainted paintings I've done. It's They're framed. I tear them out of the frames and do them all over again. It's like, yeah, it's never done because that painting was in that time, in that place. But sometimes I like the fact it's like a photograph. It is done. I can accept it. I could change it. The ones that I'm most proud of are the ones I just leave alone. I'm going to leave them alone, but I could change them. Some of the best work I've done is basically repainting, not just painting. I I try to always find out if I'm following some rule I didn't know existed. You wrote about that in your book. I was fascinated about that. I'm always looking for that. Because I am a self-taught painter, I watch my wife. She's very respectful. She knows I'm an autodidact, and I don't want noise. I want to discover. And my son, who's prolific and has never He's fast and he's the turn on the faucet, and something comes out and he never makes a mistake because there are no mistakes. He just keeps going and somehow, then he resolves and it's over.

[01:19:44.120] - Speaker 1
So every once in a while, I get a tip from one of them or the other. But my wife, years ago, gave me one tip to start with. The first tip when I painted, she said, Don't use black. Don't use black. For years, I would not use black. I would do everything I could. One day, I discovered, Hey, I don't have to follow this rule anymore. But I learned so much by not using black.

[01:20:14.870] - Speaker 2
Are you precious about the first stroke?

[01:20:19.260] - Speaker 1
It's a commitment, and I can't think about it. If I think about it, I won't do it right. You'll look at my paintings. No, you were thinking there, Mel. I don't want you to look at my paintings and think that I was thinking. This is my way of not thinking. I'm a great fan of not thinking.

[01:20:40.830] - Speaker 2
I think a lot- Did you say you've lived most of your life in your head?

[01:20:44.440] - Speaker 1
I did. Yeah. And I realized that basically it's just noise that tunes out everything. The joy of growing older is really accepting how little I know and enjoying it. I know how to do a thing or not, but know in the big sense, I'm constantly surprised. I could never explain. And I was a great explainer. But I basically trapped myself. And I'm an appreciator of things that are really finally done. I love things that are beautiful and well done or well thought or authentic and come from Come from the same place. You can see when somebody... It doesn't matter what they're creating. It doesn't matter. What matters is where it's coming from. You can see the source in almost every work. Often it's a thought. You can go flick through the television show and it's one thing after another. It's one concept after another. You can listen to music. It's one concept after another. There we go. But when you hit the one that's not, that's life. That's what we're here for.

[01:22:00.300] - Speaker 2
