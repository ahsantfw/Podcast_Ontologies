[00:00:07.400] - Speaker 1
Tétragrammaton. When I finished Man with the Iron Fist, my next film was supposed to be One Spoon of Chocolate. And I remember going to the Universal and pitching some ideas, and the one that Adam Fogerson thought was cool was one spoon of chocolate. And so I was like, okay, I'll start writing it, and got stuck. And it wasn't until I was on a tour with the New York City Mind with Nas that I started writing it again. Then I was like, I'm going to do it.

[00:00:55.940] - Speaker 2
Did something trigger it? What do you think allowed it to happen then where it didn't happen before?

[00:01:01.780] - Speaker 1
I think it was, you go back through your old lyrics and your old things. I think it was like, because I don't know if it's a time, because it's actually a pretty dark film. It sounds simple, but it has some strong racial connotations in it as well. And I don't really feel that. I don't feel that, personally. I'm more naive to it than consensus to it. But in my writing and in my ideas of my characters is very Very prevalent.

[00:01:31.220] - Speaker 2
Why do you think?

[00:01:32.910] - Speaker 1
I think as an artist, I've always been able to put descriptions of life in art, whether I agreed or disagreed with it. Then it's been one of my abilities as an artist. Not knowing that at first. You never know what you are in the beginning. But as time kept going, it's like, you know what? I'm a transmitter. I'm instrument. I'm the conduit. You know what I mean? And the funny thing is some of the stuff that's in my film, there's articles about the subject matter just appearing. It was like, oh, okay. So maybe there was something to that. Sometimes Where you were getting messages just from around you that related to the film. Yeah.

[00:02:20.120] - Speaker 2
And how long had the film been dormant at that time?

[00:02:23.080] - Speaker 1
The film was sitting there for almost 13 years until last year on the tour bus. I always planned to write on the tour bus, though. That's my plan. I'm going to get a bus. I'm going to write something. And it was this. And me and my wife, I started sitting right beside me and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah I can use some of our own finances. And she agreed.

[00:02:52.890] - Speaker 2
Tell me, what's the story?

[00:02:54.420] - Speaker 1
The basis of the story is a man who's... There's some military service for the country, but we meet him coming out of jail. And he has no family, nowhere to go. His only family is his cousin who lives in Ohio. But in that town, there's so much corruption and such an undertone of insidious behavior, and he ends up stumbling into it. And this is a guy that... The line they tell him is, Here's your transfer to Ohio. I pulled some strings to get you there, Ramsey. So I believe you got potential, soldier. Just stay out of trouble. He's like, Trouble is the last thing on my mind. All he finds is trouble. After some good times, it just goes bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

[00:03:48.610] - Speaker 2
And was he participating in the troubles or was he just seeing it?

[00:03:52.880] - Speaker 1
Him, his family and the friends, the girl, they become victims of the trouble.

[00:03:57.960] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:03:58.740] - Speaker 1
When you become victim of trouble, you either got to accept being a victim or maybe you got to be the hero. You got three years for assault and battery. He said, Yeah, for beating up my neighbor's drunk husband who was always beating up on her. He was like, Yeah, but you put that man in a coma. You got another extra year here for breaking an inmate's jaw. Yeah, he was a bully. What are you, some hero? No, I'm not a hero. I sold my time out. It's like he's not a hero, but he is a hero.

[00:04:40.310] - Speaker 2
He's put in these positions where he has to defend himself or the people around him, and he's vilified for that. But it sounds like we'll be on his side when we're watching it.

[00:04:51.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. How did you find the people to be in it? When I was writing it, I knew when I I picked the pin back up, I knew who I wanted to be, the lead.

[00:05:03.500] - Speaker 2
And you got that person? Yes. Who was it?

[00:05:05.300] - Speaker 1
It was a young man named Shameek Moh. So Shamik, this is the second film with me, Third Project. He played Rayquan in my TV series. His first movie was a movie called Dope, where he was just a young, comedic type kid. He's the voice of Spider-Man in a Spider-Verse. But to me, he's a very strong, actually, conduit, chameleon type actor. Right now, he got a comedies out, some type of romantic comedy where he's just a silly, crazy guy.

[00:05:36.280] - Speaker 2
But this is a serious dramatic performance.

[00:05:38.930] - Speaker 1
This is total opposite. I know he has that ability because when I did another film with him called Cut Throw City, we made it to number one on Netflix. Great. I knew that, okay, well, our energy works. People responded to it. But when we was doing that movie, he broke some stereotypes for me because in this movie, Cutthrow City. I was like, okay, you're going to come home after doing a robbery, him and his friends. You're going to come in, shirt off. You're going to have the gun. You're going to walk in to your bedroom. Your wife going to wake up and blah, blah, blah. You're going to put the gun down. You're going to tell her what happened. He was like, well, how do I hold a gun? He never held a gun before. You see what I mean? I was like, Well, my day. I was like, Well, look, you hold it like this and you load it like... I said, your gun is like a phallus in all reality. You got to treat it as such. It's a symbol of power. It's like two nuts in the dick at the end of the day.

[00:06:38.010] - Speaker 1
It has that and you load it up. But seeing his innocence and then seeing his performance It's great. I said, This kid is great. When I did the Wu-Tang saga, I called them. I said, Yo, he's the only one who did an audition. I'm doing this TV show. I just wanted to know if you're available. It's going to take us some years of your life, but I got something I would love for you to join. He was like, Oh, just let me know. Ogie. They call me Ogie and shit. I don't know if I like Ogie.

[00:07:09.790] - Speaker 2
You've earned it.

[00:07:13.960] - Speaker 1
Anyway, so then Yeah. So now he's in this one. And the last thing I'll say about it is we shot it, and now we're in post-production. I showed my first cut to the CIA team this weekend and a few other people and getting great responses. I still got to I'll sandpaper it down and shape it up.

[00:07:33.100] - Speaker 2
Why did you decide to produce it yourself instead of raise money and then make it that way?

[00:07:38.730] - Speaker 1
I just wanted to do it. Even the ballet, I just wanted to do it, man. It's like so much of my life has been paid to do shit or hired to do something. First of all, blessed that I can make a decision to do it, to do stuff. But yeah, it's like, yo.

[00:07:57.560] - Speaker 2
I love that you did. It's just rare that people do Yeah.

[00:08:01.410] - Speaker 1
I'm in that phase. I'm in that phase of life. It's just like, just do it. It's going to do. Because at the end of the day, we've definitely had success in our lives. We've definitely been blessed. We know that we can never stop counting that. But then we also know that we're vessels of art. So what am I supposed to do? To sit back and wait for someone to say, Hey, come paint me something? Or do I go out there and paint it? Van Gogh already cut his ear off for some shit like that. To pay for some whatever to keep going, right? I remember Robert Rodriguez, one of the early mentors for me in film, as far as reading this book and spending some time with him in the early 2000s. He sold his skin to build up money to make his first... He was there, he was buying skin for some college thing. He'd go in and get his money.

[00:08:56.540] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:08:58.160] - Speaker 1
And then he'd become one of these guys who create all these movies that inspires the whole genre. You don't get it so many things if you don't get Robert R. G. You know what I mean? You don't even get Spy Kids, which brings back a lot of our actors and Latin actors that was out of the business. Ev We surged them. You don't get Antonio Banderian.

[00:09:18.040] - Speaker 2
He makes all of his stuff completely outside of the system.

[00:09:21.370] - Speaker 1
Totally. Or the Zone Studio in Austin.

[00:09:24.080] - Speaker 2
So beautiful.

[00:09:24.920] - Speaker 1
Even though I'm starting a little late, that's my vision as well. That's division.

[00:09:31.020] - Speaker 2
It's a good model.

[00:09:31.850] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's a good model. And it worked. We saw it work.

[00:09:36.960] - Speaker 2
So you keep it tight in terms of crew and stuff, I imagine.

[00:09:41.670] - Speaker 1
Well, you still got to deal with the system. So the system is the system. I'm a Union man. So I got to play by the Union rules, and I do. And so because of the system, it's always going to be tough to do it here in America. But being a Union man and How different is it to do it in other places than America? Ain't no union. You can go to London and cut your price down by 20%, 25%.

[00:10:08.670] - Speaker 2
Is that why a lot of people also film in like, Vancouver?

[00:10:13.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah, well, Vancouver, you might still get caught with the union, where Vancouver has a strong tax incentive, and then the dollars a little stronger. So that's that. But you can't duck. You won't be able to duck the unions in the whole North America, I think. Because I just did a film, The studio system is a studio system. I'm a Union man, so I don't have no problem with the Union. No, I understand. But it does, just to answer your question, it does force us to You can't have a small crew. You need a guy that's operating the camera, a guy that's pulling the focus, a guy that's controlling the light. You need the four people when independently, that could be two people. You know what I mean? And for every camera that you got, you need that amount of people. So three cameras mean 12 to 16 people. That 12 to 16 Now, 12 to 16 people, then you got to deal with union fringes because they got to get their Medicaid and all that other stuff. And that's your cost for your portion of time that you're buying it is. So the fringes are the things that really kill us in America.

[00:11:28.500] - Speaker 1
And the studios, every always been fighting against it. I don't think studios should fight against it in the sense of because their profit margin and their business model and what they've gained over the course of the commodity that they created, this is the only way they can give back is by making sure somebody could get their teeth fixed and go to the doctor. But on an independent level, it stops independent films.

[00:11:52.140] - Speaker 2
My other buddy did this film. Your first film, you made independently or no?

[00:11:57.390] - Speaker 1
No, my first film I did was made with a studio, but I did it in China. So the only people that had Union was the team of people I brought over. So I have 400 people working for us. Only 20 of us were Union men. I see. Which was another way of doing it.

[00:12:17.800] - Speaker 2
Was it difficult hiring the team in China?

[00:12:21.410] - Speaker 1
I had a DP who had the... I hired him right after he had the number one movie in the country. Wow. Wow. Now he's mine, right? Wow. And he was dissatisfied with some shit because everybody got their things, right? And they were putting some pressure on him. I was like, Why are you taking it? You got the number one movie. So, Man, it's a thousand guys waiting to take my job. So that's the difference there. See, in our world, in the Directors' Guild, you're not going to find even 5,000 people.

[00:13:00.050] - Speaker 2
It's a much shorter list. Yeah.

[00:13:03.100] - Speaker 1
And his thing might be 150,000 people and nobody's in the union. You know what I mean? So he took everything. I said, Yo, come eat the lunch with us. I had a whole kitchen built. We had catered food. You sit down, had the guy holding a napkin for lunch. Because the money went far out there. But most of my crew, their lunch comes in a truck and you'll know what it is. It's like a school lunch. Open it. Oh, okay. You eat and you go to work. But so for my actors who were some legends, too, I had legendary actors in my book, Gordon Lou, Chinquantai, or L'Arcang. These guys, for me, these are the guys that I sampled or watched their movies. So now they're in my movie, and I had them all come to eat lunch with the director. And they was like, It was the best lunch they ever had on the side. We I had steak, fish, veggies burgers. I had vegan food.

[00:14:05.100] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:14:05.650] - Speaker 1
I had to lay it out.

[00:14:07.580] - Speaker 2
That sounds great.

[00:14:08.690] - Speaker 1
That was fun.

[00:14:13.750] - Speaker 2
Who is Prince Rakeen Yeah, Prince Rakeem.

[00:14:18.390] - Speaker 1
Well, now he's my son. My son is the physical embodiment of that because he's born with it. But it was something that I discovered. My name became Prince Rakeem at the age of 11.

[00:14:32.480] - Speaker 2
And you gave yourself the name?

[00:14:34.340] - Speaker 1
Gave myself the name. If I could try to explain it to myself, I know the inspiration during my cousin, the Jizu, had knowledge of self. He gave me knowledge of myself and had me study mathematics, and it opened my mind or made everything else around me even more comprehensible. I never forget the day he gave me the mathematics, right? I'm walking home from Park Hill, Staten Island to Stableton.

[00:15:00.670] - Speaker 2
He can give it to you in a day?

[00:15:02.690] - Speaker 1
The first 10 concepts, which is knowledge, wisdom, understanding. So he had that all in the Xerox paper back then, right? And you get that as like, this is your first lesson. And you study that. You got to memorize these. And I'm a memorizer guy. My brain is like that. But I'm walking home and the first lesson says knowledge. Knowledge is to know, look, listen, observe, also respect. Knowledge is to know the ledge so you don't fall off the edge. It's the basic foundation of everything in creation. Like the sun is the foundation of the solar system. That's knowledge. And wisdom is the manifestation of knowledge. It's knowledge and activation. It's the experience. It's wise words spoken by a wise man to wise the dome. It's also symbolic to the woman. So these things are my first lessons. Then I'm walking home and I live in Stableton, but I live on the same street as this big church. I'm staying with my grandmother at this time. And I walk by the church and the lady is handing out pamphlets, and she hands me a Jesus Christ pamphlet where it says, Jesus Christ, the bread of Christ.

[00:16:26.790] - Speaker 1
It says, eat the bread of Christ to nourish your soul. Now, just by having knowledge, no look and observe, and respect, I respect what it was. So I memorized that as well. So these different principles of knowledge and spirituality all start flooding me. At the same time, I just seen 36 Chambers of Shal in that year. So it's like all this was going through me. So becoming Prince Rockin, since my father wasn't present, I think the Prince came from me saying that naturally I'll be the son of a king. And when I grow up, I'll be a king and my son will be a prince. So this is like the natural mind that my mind had. So it may be a spoonful of his imagination. But it's like this is what I wanted. And Rockin There was no Rakeem. There was a Rakeem. There was a Rakeem with a K-I-N-G. But there was no Rakeem that had that name. Actually, it was like, it's not a proper name because there's actually not a Rakeem in Arabic or in the Quran or nowhere, according to what was told to me at that time. I said, It's original.

[00:17:41.680] - Speaker 1
And therefore, Rakeem means to be original. And I'm a prince. You know what I mean? And that became me. This is from the age of 11. By the time I share with the public, I become Prince Rakeem, the MCAP.

[00:17:56.050] - Speaker 2
How old are you then when you're the MCAP?

[00:17:58.250] - Speaker 1
I think I let it be my MCAP name around the age of 16. Before then, even though I had knowledge of self, I had various MCAP names that was different than my racist name.

[00:18:11.300] - Speaker 2
Would you say when the names change, the rimes change?

[00:18:15.460] - Speaker 1
Yes. I think that the art finds this, I call it attribute. So at the end of the day, between 11 to my physical age now, I've definitely had over 16 different attributes. I made a joke. I don't know if I could keep saying this. It wasn't a joke, but I could say it to you. I'll say this, this is the last time I'll say it. I was saying that I had created this maybe two years ago, that I am artistically schizophrenia. My friend Sophia Chang said, Don't say that anymore. You are very curious and you seek out, and you're always journeying for more expressions. So I would use the word curiosity Versus schizophrenia, because schizophrenia has such a big meaning. Negative connotation.

[00:19:03.640] - Speaker 2
It doesn't sound like you mean it in a negative way.

[00:19:06.970] - Speaker 1
I don't mean it in a negative way. But I thought it was a great description of the artistic multiple personalities that I've been able to embody and still embody given on any given day. I don't want to be offensive, so I take a heat to her, and this is probably the last time I'll say that.

[00:19:28.260] - Speaker 2
If the lyrics change depending on the personality, which comes first? Is it Rakeem exists and then the rimes come, or do the rimes come, and then you realize that's not Rakeem talking, that's someone else?

[00:19:44.160] - Speaker 1
That's a good question. And it becomes blurred. But I think at one point, it was the art made it separate. On Protect Your Neck, when we put out our first video, it says in the video, Exit Prince Rakeem, enter the Risa. And it scrolls across the screen. And I meant that. I was like, I'm not Prince Rakeem, anymore. You are meeting the Risa now. And this is a well-advanced, enlightened version of Prince Rakeem. The Z wasn't in my name. My name was divine Prince Rakeem. Yeah. First was Rakeem, Prince Rakeem, divine Prince. We keep adding titles. By the time I was 19 of 20, I'll give it 20. My attribute was divine Prince Master Rakeem, Allah. That was my name. Allah is the name of the Father. So all our last names have to be Allah. Whoever your father is, you take his last name. So then from just two years later and going through rainhouse, snowing, earthquakes, and all personal, and also just improving and deep into my art, deep into my music, my study, my... I was deep into it. You know what I mean? Science of I'm not going to lie. We was on it.

[00:21:16.810] - Speaker 1
You know what I mean? It was like, no. My name was... And also I went the wrong way at one point. Tell me. The story is known, but just scrambling in the street selling drugs and getting them called violence and getting caught in shit and getting locked up for shit. It's like, that wasn't a way of a righteous man. Wasn't even a way of an intelligent man. And I had righteousness and intelligence all in my system.

[00:21:43.000] - Speaker 2
Was it just youth that allowed that to happen, would you say, or something else?

[00:21:47.060] - Speaker 1
I think youth and circumstances. It was no other way to get money. You know what I mean? I could grab it. I could throw a rock through a window and get it. But especially at the mindset and measurement of how we I wanted it. Just to be honest, I did work many jobs. I was a messenger, worked at a restaurant, worked as a guy who I always say that put screws in a box. That was my job. Take the screw, put it in the box, moving on. Take the screw, put it in the box, moving on. And since I was-One screw per box? No, no, depending. Sometimes it was one big nut boom. Sometimes it's 50 little pellets. In fact, the pellets that we would use became the ones that was the exact same size as the New York City token. So now I can sell a box. Those are $50. Because we figured out, we got the motherfucking Bung. It works like a token. Amazing. They got a little joke, man. Jilly used to do. We'll go to the train station, and just stick it in. When somebody comes, you go, I'm not catching this train.

[00:22:59.480] - Speaker 1
Can you just We're not even talking. Go ahead, bro. Go. Make about 20 bucks, go get some weed, some liquor. That's a good day, right? Yeah. But anyway, going negative, though, selling drugs, getting involved with street crime. It was totally not natural for me. Being a smart man and a man that's not scared to do shit, yeah, of course, I was able to Excel in that until I couldn't Excel, until it caught up. And now I'm in it behind the bars. You know what I mean?

[00:23:29.700] - Speaker 2
How long were you waiting for?

[00:23:30.870] - Speaker 1
I was facing eight years. Fortunately, I was able to bail out. Took me 30 days to bail out. I only did two 30-day stretches in my life. One 30-day stretch at about 17, 18, and one right before '21, right before Wutain, bailed out, were on the trial. There's a lot of Black guys on one trial. I went to trial and one. And while I was going through this, my mother was so disappointed. Her face of disappointment was more crushing than this. It's 11 of us.

[00:24:08.950] - Speaker 2
Eleven brothers and sisters? Where are you in the 11?

[00:24:11.320] - Speaker 1
I'm in the middle. But I was also the one that came when life was just getting strong for our family. And by the time I get three, four years old, it goes bad for our family. You know what I mean? But anyway, What I was trying to get to was that I zigzag, zig. And in the mathematics, zigzag, zig means knowledge, wisdom, understanding. And it gives a symbolism of the zig, which could be the your brain or your thought, goes into the zag, like the sperm cell goes into the womb, it comes back out as a higher, greater form of the zig. Like a word can go into somebody's mind or into your own mind, into the room of your mind and come out as a better idea, as a better interpretation, as a higher understanding. So I became Rakeem Zigzag Zigala, the Rizza. You know what I mean?

[00:25:12.610] - Speaker 2
That's what Rizza stands for.

[00:25:14.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:25:15.050] - Speaker 2
Did you ever say that on a record or no?

[00:25:17.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I say it in different ways. Ruling Zigzag Zigala, Jam is fatal, quick to stick my Wu-Tang swart right through your navel, suspensful. That's on Seventh Chamber. Let me talk about my lyrics to a quick moment because it's fun to say. One thing about my lyrics, they are compressed, concentrated ideas. And most people lyrics are, I would say. But I think out of a lot of the MCs, I don't think no one has really compressed their lyrics as much as me and my Who brothers. And I think because if you go back to the very first lyrics of, Chill with the feedback, Black, we don't need that. It's 10 o'clock. Oh, where the fuck should see that? Chill with the feedback. So the feedback also from the feedback of the mic feedback with the beef feedback somebody gives you. We don't need that. 10 o'clock, where the fuck should see that? Remember that commercial in New York, Come on TV? So now I'm saying, Feeling mad hostile, wearing El Postal, flowing like Christ when I speak the gospel. So now, flowing like Christ when I speak the gospel, that goes back to me getting that first pamphlet, The Bread of Christ, right?

[00:26:28.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But having my mathematics in Then in the very next line is a Buddhist line. It says, Flowing like Christ when I speak the gospel, I straw with the Holy robe. So the Abbot of Shaalin or the Abbot of Wutain must wear that Holy robe, and the Holy robe represents their position. So I straw with the Holy robe, then attack the globe with the buckus, style the ruckus. Now we got ruckus. Ten times 10 men committing mad sin. Wait, I thought we was righteous. But we're committing mad sin because you turn the other cheek and I break your fucking chin. And that was the idea of the idea that when Malcolm and Martin was teaching, Martin was saying, Turn the other cheek. But no, they were still getting beaten down with sticks. So no, we don't have to break a chin. We can't offer your cheek up. Turn up your fucking chin. Then I went to this regular hip hop slang, boom, bang. It's like African drums. It'll be coming around the mountain when I come. That's the fun of it. Then we go into the political line, crazy I'm boring for the rap enjoyment.

[00:27:32.450] - Speaker 1
My clan increased like black unemployment. That's stupid, but it's like, wait a minute. You increased them like black unemployment? Yeah. Another one. There. There goes another one pops up right in the middle of the lyric. Then I pass the mic to The genius. Take us the fuck out of here. Then, of course, he goes into a very descriptive, very detailed way of our industry. It's still multiple meanings, but One thing about the juzza is that he also provides you the surface view and the beneath the surface view. Whereas for me, I hide a lot of the surface view. You got to go beneath the surface to figure out the habit.

[00:28:16.750] - Speaker 2
Your lyrics are more oblique, I'd say.

[00:28:19.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I'll take that one.

[00:28:20.740] - Speaker 2
But the beauty of that is it feels like your lyrics are for the initiated.

[00:28:28.900] - Speaker 1
Right.

[00:28:30.010] - Speaker 2
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:28:30.910] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you got to know. You got to be it. You got to know. You got to know. Would you guys ever talk about lyrics like each other's lyrics, or you just did your verse and then next rapper does their verse? Well, as a producer, I was definitely able to shape, even censor and direct lyrics, and especially in the first five albums, I would interject. But as time went on, there was no need for interjection. Everybody had mastered their craft and mastered who they were. In the process of it being competition- Do you feel like there was competition within the group? Yeah.

[00:29:12.200] - Speaker 2
Everybody wanted to outrap everybody else?

[00:29:14.860] - Speaker 1
Yeah, this is MCs.

[00:29:15.930] - Speaker 2
Is that part of what makes Wu-Tang so strong? Yeah. It's very interesting. I never thought of it that way.

[00:29:21.300] - Speaker 1
The Juzo had a lyrics. He said, I forgot the line in front of it, but the punch line was, The clan makes me Rhyme like D. Banner under pressure. So we know who D. Banner is, right? So he's saying he's about to turn to the Hulk because the clan is making him like, Rhyme like when Dr. Banner gets pressure, you got to go into the Hulk to fuck with these dudes. You know what I mean? You'll hear it throughout our lyrics. You'll hear us say something like, This one made me do that.

[00:29:54.830] - Speaker 2
You know what I mean? It's almost like a battle in a way. Yeah. It is, though. It's very interesting. I never thought of it that way.

[00:30:03.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah. At a different time, different one of us wins. The thing that was crazy for us is that when they say that Juz is their head, it's because he is the foundation of our lyrical skills and approach. For many years, it was his determination. I'm the abbot. So even if somebody comes for me for the determination measure, I didn't go to him. You know what I mean? Because of my respect and reverence of him, he's the one that had me pick up my pen. He's the one that had me study my knowledge. So he's my enlightener. And so I always go back to my enlightener. During the period of years, and sometimes it just be me and him. I'm like, who's the best in the clan right now? And it'll be different ones. You know what I mean? And either way, the listener wins because they get the best of you both.

[00:31:01.260] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:31:02.040] - Speaker 1
At one point, Killer Preast was the best. At one point, from the Wolf family, it was a year when everybody was like, Killer Pris is the LSMC. I was pissed off. You know what I mean? I came to beat Killer Preast in '97. You know what I mean? If you go back and check my lyrics in '97. So even though Ghost got the best lyrics of the year on that song, Impossible, because he was like, Call the ambulance. Jamie been shot. He put you right there. It was such a dramatic- Ghost lyrics are incredible.

[00:31:36.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah, such a dramatic. That's incredible.

[00:31:37.930] - Speaker 1
But Jesus came to me and said, Now, you got the best lyrics because of the content, Fusion of the Father elements. That's dealing with the Daoism alchemy, the search for the higher intelligence. Women walking around celibate, living life irrelevant. The most inelevant king can communicate through a dream. A mental picture is formed. A large herd and seen everywhere. With your surround atmosphere, thermosphere, stratosphere, trapposphere. Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here? So understanding makes the truth crystal clear. But still, we got innocent Black immigrants, 85 dependents, welfare recipients, locked their house in tenements. And my neighborhood has been stamped as a concentration camp. Lamp. But nighttime, I walk through my third eye as bright as a street lamp. And there's electric probes, electric straws, robotic probes. They're taking a telescopeic pictures of the globe while babies being born with microchips stuffed inside their earlobes. They're vaccinated. Lies fabricated and exaggerated. You know what I mean? Food and drug administration, testing, poison in prison populations. It's a lot of shit going on in there. What? Call the ambulance. Jamie been shot. Where the chimie don't go, nigga, you my motherfucking heart. That was something else.

[00:33:06.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's incredible. Incredible. Did you think of yourself primarily as an emcee or something else?

[00:33:21.170] - Speaker 1
Well, I think my first form of art was emceeing.

[00:33:25.800] - Speaker 2
Before producing? Yeah.

[00:33:27.400] - Speaker 1
I wrote my first rhyme at the age of nine. I've recited my first rhyme at the age of eight, but that was what Juzza wrote. So I first started by reciting and copying his lyrics. Another emcee who never really made it out of the hood named Scottie Wadi. Him and Juzza, they had their tape early, and I would copy them. And then at 9, I wrote my own lyrics, you know what I mean? Similar to this, of course, right? And then I think by the time I was 13, 14, I think I was good. Some of the lyrics that ODB says are the ones that I wrote when I was 14 because I was to make him write, and then he wouldn't, and I'll give him mine. That's why sometimes on some of his cadence or some of his lyrics may have seen not not as deeply potent as some of the Wu brothers, because he would just take what was already there because he realized that at the end of the day, it's a song. It's a performance. He said, You all want to get on the mic and rum, and rum, and rum, and rum, and rum?

[00:34:30.420] - Speaker 1
Fuck that shit. Should I make his head? He says that right on his song. You know what I mean? I want to see him up in the air. Come on, do it. Everybody, come along, come along, come along, come along, come along. How do you put your... He's performing. We didn't catch that. We learned that from him. You know what I mean? We learned that, wait a minute. You have to put the performance and the animation into it.

[00:34:58.900] - Speaker 2
The personality, like his personality would come through where it wasn't necessarily about the words, but it might be your favorite verse. Exactly. Regardless.

[00:35:07.980] - Speaker 1
That's the point I'm making. Because he realized the performance was even stronger than trying to boggle somebody head. Whereas some of us are trying to boggle your head, especially myself.

[00:35:20.040] - Speaker 2
With the words.

[00:35:20.850] - Speaker 1
Some of us is trying to show you how dangerous they are. But if the Raiquan first, listen to the first listened to the first Wu album and listened to his early features, he always got 16 shots. You know what I mean? He bussing shots in his rap, and he talking about his cars, his sneakers, and his guns. You know what I mean? Because he's a street You know what I mean? You know Ghost is a street dude. You could feel the danger in this motherfucking. You know what I mean? He'd be like, You hear the shanks sleeping on the wall? But then Deck, and I got to go through it, but Inspector Deck, though, he's looking at it through a magnifying glass. So if Ghostface saw the license plate, and he wrote that in the lyrics, Dex saw the tag was aspired. You know what I mean? And that's why his lyrics are, I bomb atomically Socrates's philosophies and hypotheses, can't define why I be dropping these mockeries. Lyrically performed on robbery, fled with the lottery. Possibly they spotted me. It's like, damn, that's a lot in four lines.

[00:36:29.000] - Speaker 2
What was the experience of making those records and those guys bringing in those verses.

[00:36:33.900] - Speaker 1
It was just like an exuberating fun, young energy. To be quite honest with you, when you were young like that, I think each and every last one of us thought that we were the best one. Nobody didn't think that he beat me. It's like, yeah. If you did think he beat you on that one, you beat him on that one. Yeah. So you couldn't tell Ugar that he don't got the best lyrics. He's not going to, What, mother, you stupid motherfucker, I eat your shit up. He's not going for that. You know what I mean? He thinks that how he think is to think.

[00:37:14.200] - Speaker 2
Had they ever been a group before with the internal competition like that?

[00:37:20.970] - Speaker 1
I don't know.

[00:37:21.570] - Speaker 2
I'm not aware of it.

[00:37:22.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I don't know. That's something that we should maybe open up the floor for and have us think because it seemed like most groups of complementing each other. We do complement each other.

[00:37:32.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but it's different. What you're describing is different than that.

[00:37:34.970] - Speaker 1
Because we approach hip hop- There's also never been a group with that many rappers before, so that's another big piece of it.

[00:37:42.100] - Speaker 2
That's another big thing, yeah.

[00:37:42.910] - Speaker 1
But we approach it as Swartzman. That's why it's called the Wutang clan. These are all warriors, and their tongue is their sword, and they're pointed at whatever they got appointed at, even at each other.

[00:37:53.900] - Speaker 2
How would you describe your production?

[00:37:57.710] - Speaker 1
It's hard for me to describe it. I can add on to the description. I actually believe two things about me. One, I believe that there was no other way to define my production other than Hip hop. That's what I believe. I believe that all the producers, you could define it as jazz, funk, soul, especially 36 chamber. I don't think you could... What is this shit? It's hip hop. That's what it is. It's not It's nothing else. Yeah.

[00:38:31.160] - Speaker 2
It's not even a variation on anything else. It's pure hip hop.

[00:38:35.760] - Speaker 1
I think that's what I think. That's something that you could look at me and see. Then the second thing I think that's so awkward, but weird, and But potentially, it's very true, and I felt true about this for a long time, especially for the first 10 years of my career, I felt like I make beats for people to emcee to, not to dance to. I make beats that's made to challenge the emcee. If the emcee could catch it and could catch my vibe, listen to Method, man. You don't even hear people take my beats and freestyle over them. Maybe Cream, because it's very There's a couple, but you don't hear other rappers take my beat because it ain't easy. But you got to be an emcee to do it.

[00:39:24.290] - Speaker 2
You can't even be a rapper. And you think that's because you were an emcee first? Yeah.

[00:39:27.790] - Speaker 1
I made beats. I rime to have a beat first anyway. If I could rime to it, you could rime to it. If you can't rime to it, you're not a good emcee. At one point, we thought rapping and emceeing was two different things. We really felt that way. You know what I mean?

[00:39:43.780] - Speaker 2
How would you How would you describe the difference?

[00:39:46.520] - Speaker 1
Well, a rap is like anybody could rap, almost. Not anybody, but almost. You know what I mean? A emcee Is, I guess I could try to describe it in a lyrics. The emce, you say, I ain't on this thing that I be using. The emce means the master confusion. A emce is always like time I'm moving constantly. Okay? It ain't just move the crowd, which he has to move the crowd. You know what I mean? But I had a whole lyric where I wrote down all the different things that an emcee must do. You mean? He must match the competition. And I think that a MCAP is almost like the difference between a Jedi Knight and a Samara, because a Jedi Knight has a lightsaber. Not only is this lightsaber powerful, his force is powerful. You know what I mean? So I know this is all using, trying to explain something that the best way I can. Hard to explain, of course. Exactly. It's hard to explain. But it's a difference, and you can hear it. You can feel it. You know what I mean? You can feel it.

[00:41:06.620] - Speaker 2
Does it have anything to do with the music? Because it feels like when you first said it, what I heard was that a rapper writes words that you could probably say on anything. Whereas an emcee, you could only say it over the particular beat because it's connected to the beat.

[00:41:28.740] - Speaker 1
That's a piece of it That's a good digestion of it. Look, Nas is an emcee. It's a fact. Even you took away all the music, it's still potent. Absolutely. That's another way of looking at it, too. What happens if you take away all the music? Is it potent? What happens if you write it down? Is it stronger?

[00:41:53.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah. An emcee is more like a poet, we may say.

[00:41:58.470] - Speaker 1
He definitely has to be part A poet, right?

[00:42:00.750] - Speaker 2
Where the rapper is more like somebody doing songs.

[00:42:04.380] - Speaker 1
That's a good argument because a poet, you have to be a poet and deeper than a poet. Because I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side. That's a lot right there. That's the New York Times. That's a lot in that one phrase. Staying alive was no job. Okay, that's simple. I had secondhand. My mom's bounced on the old man. So then we moved to Shauna land. In four lines, right? In Melly Mel, A child is born with no state of mind, blind to the ways of mankind. God smiling on you, but he's frowning, too, because only God knows what you've been through. Even in those four lines.

[00:42:53.990] - Speaker 2
A lot of information.

[00:42:55.260] - Speaker 1
A lot of information. And MCs tend to do that. And they do it in a way that even if you hear it 20 years later, it has the same thing. Now, no disrespect for it. Because it's deep.

[00:43:06.120] - Speaker 2
You're saying the MC's lyrics have a depth that make it timeless. That's a fact. Tell me from a technical standpoint, how you would go about production from the beginning.

[00:43:20.220] - Speaker 1
Okay, on a technical standpoint, how I went about production, first thing is use whatever you got, right? Of course, I started with the turntable and the four track.

[00:43:30.520] - Speaker 2
We see the 4-Track cassette at that time?

[00:43:32.180] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the four-track Yamaha four-track. This is maybe '16, '17. The first thing is just a square tape recorder. One of those tape recorders? Yeah, it hit play and record and put the tape in.Casset.

[00:43:46.230] - Speaker 2
Recorder.casset.

[00:43:46.640] - Speaker 1
Recorders. My cousin Ramsey had one. Ramsey is old dirty master's big brother. So he's a few years older than us. Actually, he's going to be ahead of us on everything. Rekid collection, rock and roll. He's a guitar player, keyboard player. He got turntables first. Everything, right? The O'Doherty's mother and father work for transit and for 911. They're like the Jefferson's to my family. My family is the welfare, 11 Kids Welfare family. But the first thing was this tape recorder. And the comic books in a shoe box. And that's where the drums were. And we were just wrapping to the tape recorder and play that back. Then, of course, the Kanye comes out, and now you got the two tape recorders, and then you're doing pause tapes.

[00:44:31.190] - Speaker 2
Would it be pause tapes from stuff you'd record off the radio?

[00:44:35.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah, whatever.

[00:44:36.050] - Speaker 2
Or turntable? Yeah.

[00:44:37.620] - Speaker 1
Whatever you could get a track from or beats from. But before that, though, I heard the song Flashes on the beat box. So I said, What is a beat box? So I already had a pair of turntables, straight arms, sadly, but went down- Did you have a mixer as well?

[00:44:55.950] - Speaker 2
I had a mixer.

[00:44:56.170] - Speaker 1
We sold newspapers to get this. That's to give you a little bit of background.

[00:45:00.650] - Speaker 2
G-l-i? What was the mixer you had?

[00:45:01.720] - Speaker 1
No, I had no brand. It wasn't even a Gemini. Eventually, I got a Gemini. It's more like I got the $60 ship.

[00:45:10.700] - Speaker 2
You know what I mean?

[00:45:11.700] - Speaker 1
I didn't have- You got it like Radio Shack?

[00:45:13.790] - Speaker 2
Do you remember where you got it?

[00:45:14.530] - Speaker 1
I got it from 14th Street in Manhattan. Remember they had all that? They had like five or 10 doors.

[00:45:19.230] - Speaker 2
And all the boom boxes and everything.

[00:45:21.830] - Speaker 1
And they had the rhythm box where you just get waltz, slow rock, bossing over. But if you press two buttons together, what happened? It would change it to something different. If you hit the fill button, so that was my first technology demo. It wasn't even a rolling. I know Roland maybe invented it, but by the time we got it, it was some generic brand that come in business, get out of business. All right. Then all of a sudden, 14 years old, high school, I see a 606.

[00:45:55.200] - Speaker 2
That was like a small white drum machine? Silver.

[00:45:58.300] - Speaker 1
Small Silver 606. We borrow it from a guy, and he had to basically pull a gun to get it back from us because I was like, This is the grail. From a 606, 707 comes out. Dj Dr. Rock from the 4-CM Cs had a 707. We went to his house and made demos with DJ Dr. Rock from the 4-CM Ds. You know what I mean? I was 14, 15 years old. We got Dr. Rock on the 707, Wizard Just at ODBC, doing songs. This is before the rest of the world started making their demos.

[00:46:29.680] - Speaker 2
You You still have those recordings?

[00:46:31.030] - Speaker 1
I don't have them. Somebody does. Somebody does? Somebody does. Oh, cool. I'm glad they exist. Yes, somebody does. From the 707, the 909 comes. Then my DJ gets one of those DJs, Scottie Rock. Not like Scott La Rock. His name was Scott La Rock. Then when Scott La Rock came out, everybody thought it was him, but it wasn't. But anyway, 909. So now I got a 909, four track, two turntables, and then the Casio RZ 1 comes out with the four pads for pulse sampling, that's my original setup. And that's demos from the age of 16 to maybe two years because then the SP It come out. And so did the Ensonic EPS. I had a SP-1200. So the SP-1200, you had to take the time. No, it was a very limited time. So you used to speed the records up to 78 and I didn't slow it down in the machine, which gave all of our sound, the ring that we didn't even know was part of that. I didn't know that. That's how you get this. I didn't know that that was why the ring was there. But that's why it always had this ring.

[00:47:43.240] - Speaker 1
You listened to a lot of dope tracks And it was Eazy Mode B who had the 1,200. I used to go to his house because my manager was looking for tracks for me. I saw that shit. I'll get one of those. Then when I got it, my other Colleagues/rival. You know what I mean? He was another DJ in my projects. And he used to make songs with Ghost. I make songs with Ghost, but I learned that he was colleague/rivals. But he had the EPS. But the SP-1200 was considered the cool. And he's like, Yo, I'm going to Virginia for the summer, and I can't take the EPS. I'm off in my family car. When I let you hold the EPS and you let me hold the SP-1200, I was like, All right, cool. That was like... Because the SP-1200 is a drum percussion sound. The EPS is a keyboard. I didn't know that I'm more of a keyboard player, and now I know.

[00:48:46.940] - Speaker 2
So only because you were being cool. Yeah.

[00:48:50.020] - Speaker 1
Now I'm like, I'm a keyboard player. That's what I like. I remember my cousin had the cash flow and I used to play with the keyboard. Now I realize I'm a keyboard I can play my sample. I can sample one note and fucking go up and down the key with it. With the drums playing? Yeah. What the fuck? And then I mastered that keyboard. You listen to the early rule because, of course, the EPS then went to be the EPS 16 plus, then eventually to the ASR 10. That's this thing. And When Wu comes out, those same disk, you could take your old disk, stick them to the ASR 10. The first 100 tracks that I released, besides bringing the pain, and maybe there's 10 SP-1200 tracks in my catalog, but most of those songs are ASR Asonic tracks. And that became my technology all the way through. Then I would take the MPC and middie it with the ASR 10, and that's how you get Triumf. Because now, I mean, the MPC is the most powerful, you got to admit. But it wasn't what I started with. Once again, MPC takes me back to the drum.

[00:50:10.340] - Speaker 1
I mixed that with the fucking ASR-10, and that's the Wutain Forever album, along with now people are getting the sound modules, the 1080s or the 2020s from rolling. You get the Nord lead come out, and the digital synthesizers are there now in the late '90s. And all that becomes my arsenal. And that became how I did it. And then now I was getting on one level. And then I became a keyboard Lord. Meaning, if they made it, I bought it. You know? 50, 60, 70, maybe 80 keyboards in my life. You know what I mean? They make one, I buy it just to fucking master it, make some 10, 20 tracks with it that you may never hear. And then I go, I guess those became my girls. You know what I mean? And so I was collecting keyboards for years and I ran through many of them. When I became Bobby Digital, I had all my keyboards in my studio, like how you have it, and I called it my Digital Orchestra.

[00:51:15.740] - Speaker 2
Tell me about becoming Bobby Digital.

[00:51:18.310] - Speaker 1
Basically, becoming Bobby Digital was a step backwards. Being the Rizel for those years, from 1993 up until 1999, '98, '99, I didn't realize my success. Right? Meaning economically, I was pretty monotonous with my relationship. I think I did my was almost three years just with one woman, which is weird for an artist. Okay. But I wasn't into it. After Wutang forever, being rich and being loose and seeing the world and also having some internal problems in my household, I just cut loose. You know what I mean? And then when I cut loose, I just became hedonistic, to be quite frank. And then also I became more consumption of substances. You know what I mean? And then also I just had a vision, a foresight vision. I've been blessed every few years with a vision. And this time it was everything is going digital. You got to lead the way. That's the sound of... I made a joke on myself. I'm going to share this joke with you. So my mother named me Robert Fixjero Diggs, after Robert Kennedy and John. She put those two names together and named me Robert Fixjero Diggs. And when you name Robert, sometimes they'll call you Bobby or they'll call you Robbie.

[00:52:54.980] - Speaker 1
I started thinking, well, am I a robot? I ask me a question myself. Is there something in me that's like, is there something I don't know? Am I a physical? Am I a digital? Am I a robot? Am I a man? Am I a God? All these questions was a zoning through me, and especially at this period. And I think it was a few things happening in my life. I think the trauma of what happened in my personal life, the trauma of Wutang, it's almost like, Rick, this is called Shangri-La, where we at here. And that's considered almost heaven on Earth. I was fortunate to be free in 1997. I was fortunate to be given the gift of mental freedom. And it all happened from watching a flower grow and dying one day. So I was blessed with that. But then a few days later, something very dramatic in my personal life happened, but I was free. So it didn't affect me like that. And then the Wu brothers, around the same time, decide that we're not going to finish the Rage Against the Machine tour, and everybody just starts scattering into their own way.

[00:54:14.800] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that moment in time. Tell me about the tour, and then tell me about how that happened.

[00:54:19.650] - Speaker 1
Yeah, well, we're on the biggest tour of our career. Wu-tang and Rage, 30,000 kids a night.

[00:54:25.930] - Speaker 2
Good show. What a show. What a show.

[00:54:28.800] - Speaker 1
Especially at that time. It's new. I mean, you, of course, you lived through Def Jam, so you know Beasties and Rimefest. What was it called? Fresh Fest. Fresh Fest. You know the things that you guys had did. But it was hip hop wasn't getting these moments like this. Yeah. Right. Pe and anthrax maybe, but this was it.

[00:54:50.710] - Speaker 2
Huge.

[00:54:52.310] - Speaker 1
And then my guys didn't want to do it. Didn't understand the cultural relevancy of it. And I did. I understood at that time, and it happened at one of our concerts when I saw all five families there. Black, white, red, brown, yellow. It was on a Rave tour that I invented this. Like these wings. The Wu symbol. Yeah, the Wu symbol. I saw it. I saw the people. My mind was like, We got a record. Give them something. Here you got the five families on this. This side is. Let's put it all together. That's the Wu. But the crew didn't get it. They'd rather do the college shows. They thought that we was selling out, to be quite frank.

[00:55:37.800] - Speaker 2
Because the audiences were big? Or why do you think? Tell me what you think it was.

[00:55:41.960] - Speaker 1
Big. More Whites than ever. I see. Okay. Not Shorty with the big ass right there. It was different. You know what I mean? And we from the hood.

[00:55:52.200] - Speaker 2
All of them felt that way?

[00:55:54.110] - Speaker 1
No. Except you? No, no, no, no, no. Enough of us that was looking on stage as four guys. Yeah. You know what I mean? It was like it wasn't taking serious. And not to go back like that or to point any fingers. But I remember telling them that we're going to do this first.

[00:56:10.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and then do that.

[00:56:12.220] - Speaker 1
And then do that.

[00:56:13.050] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's all good. Yeah.

[00:56:15.210] - Speaker 1
And the way it was planned was like, we're going to hit the colleges in September and go through the homecomings. It's going to be crazy. Yes. First of all, they put me and Zack on the cover of Rolling Stone. It's on. One. And one thing about Wu, it's all alpha. You don't got no non-alphas. And they gave me five years in 1992. So in 1997, what did that mean? Five years is up.

[00:56:45.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah. From the beginning, was it discussed as a five-year plan? Yes.

[00:56:49.920] - Speaker 1
Five years without interruption.

[00:56:51.580] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Five straight years. Yeah. That's a lot of work.

[00:56:56.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But now we had a year where it's not your work. We get to say what we want to say. Yeah. So now it's different.

[00:57:06.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah. For five years, they agreed that you would lead. Yeah. But after the five years, to be discussed.

[00:57:13.890] - Speaker 1
To be discussed. Even though the contract, I think one of my lawyer contract amended it. No. I was like, The contract don't mean shit.

[00:57:23.830] - Speaker 2
It doesn't mean anything. If everybody's not into it, it's not going to be any good anyway.

[00:57:28.290] - Speaker 1
And I even said it to myself, My time is up. My time is up. I'm cool with it. But it hurts.

[00:57:34.750] - Speaker 2
It did hurt. Yeah. Just because you'd worked for five years to get to that point for that opportunity to see people. Yeah.

[00:57:43.380] - Speaker 1
It hurt. That was part of the hurt. Then the personal thing was part of the hurt. Then the exploration enters me. Exploration women. I'm rich.

[00:57:56.770] - Speaker 2
Would that not have happened had the Who stayed on course?

[00:58:02.670] - Speaker 1
I don't think it would have happened.

[00:58:05.020] - Speaker 2
Because you probably would have been too busy. Yeah.

[00:58:07.850] - Speaker 1
I wasn't outside yet like that.

[00:58:10.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:58:10.240] - Speaker 1
To be quite frank, Rick, I wasn't outside. You didn't see me outside. I wasn't mysterious. Lizard was mysterious. Yeah.

[00:58:20.090] - Speaker 2
But you were working.

[00:58:24.570] - Speaker 1
Oh, definitely. I stayed in that basement. It seemed like it was all work. You could smell me from the front door. You know what I mean? That's how I was. I love it. I'm grateful for it. But the question was, how do I become Bobby Digital? Well, now it's on me. Everybody's doing them. Now, what I'm going to do? So I thought, all right, I'll do a Risa album. But I just had a vision that things were different. The world is going to change and you got to go digital. And then It was in my studio and I had some other MCs with me, the young MCs like Killer Army and Sons of Man and those type of dudes. And I just said, Yo, you got to go digital. He said, What the fuck are you talking about? I said, No, I'm telling you, you got to go digital. Everything is going to go digital. What the fuck are you talking about? You're tripping, guy. You smoking that shit. You're tripping. I said, No, digital. My studio looked different to me. It didn't look like that. It looked almost like a future. Wow. You know what I mean?

[00:59:38.410] - Speaker 2
Even though nothing had changed, you saw it in a new way. Yeah.

[00:59:43.670] - Speaker 1
Maybe he hallucinated it, too, a little bit. I don't know. But it definitely wasn't the same. And it wasn't the same.

[00:59:50.820] - Speaker 2
And then did the name come before the material or did the material come before the name?

[00:59:55.510] - Speaker 1
The idea came, and then I named it.

[01:00:00.160] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:00:01.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I was like, Bobby Digital. But now all of a sudden, because you know what it is, too? I got to honestly say, and I don't know no, no. You don't know. We never know.

[01:00:13.570] - Speaker 2
We don't know. We don't know anything. Exactly.

[01:00:14.820] - Speaker 1
But I can say that I wouldn't be able to do what I did as the Risa because that entity doesn't allow that.

[01:00:28.770] - Speaker 2
Understood. Yeah.

[01:00:30.370] - Speaker 1
You know what I mean? The Abbott can't do that, and Bobby can. And I think it became almost- Is it that the Risa functioned within the woo? I don't know. I think the Risa even functioned within like... If you think about... Let's just take my lyrics. Let's use that as an example if we can. Yeah. And you hear me... I've recorded a song called Sunshower, where if you listen to it, it should guide you on the path to knowledge of self and some enlightenment. Trouble follows behind a wicked mind. You got 20/20 vision of the prism of light, but you're still blind if you lack the inner. So every sinner will end up in an everlasting winter of hellfire, where thorns and splinters pricks your third eye out, your words fly out, but your sound die out, and you remain unheard. And you will suffer eternally, internal and externally, along with wicked fraternals who let off thermonuclear heat, weapons that could burn you firmly and permanently as you travel through the journal of the Book of Life. But those who took a life without justice will become just ice. It's been taught, Buddha taught, that your worst enemy couldn't harm you as much as your own wicked thoughts.

[01:01:57.560] - Speaker 1
But people ought be wrought, and they listen not, but they will be persecuted inside a universal court. As I inhale a strong blend of Jasmine and rose petals and sandalwood, as men be chantin' witchcraft and using instance to reach higher dimensions, I'm convinced. Anyway, it's just like, you know.

[01:02:20.140] - Speaker 2
Great lyrics.

[01:02:21.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Who is it to say that? Yeah. Right? Bobby, what you all bitch is talking about? Get the fuck out of my house before I grab you by your hand and slap my dick in your mouth. What the fuck is that? That's not Bob Dizgie. Yeah, tell me who is he. Bitch, I'll slave trade you like Izzy. Kente. Wait, fuck you, motherfucker. Bitch, you wish you could fuck. All you could do his dick.

[01:02:45.560] - Speaker 2
So Bobby Digital was the more raw character.

[01:02:49.340] - Speaker 1
Yeah, hedonistic, loose, the anger, the things that Risa already worked out. And so what happened was I realized I had to go back because I was stuck in that cave, let's call it the studio for those years. And I said, Hold on, I have to go back before I go to Risa. And I needed to go back. I didn't intentionally go back, though. It was just like, that's what was coming out of me. That was coming out. I was like, damn, this all just kept coming out of me. You know what I mean? And then I liked it, too. Take that for. And I did a five Million Dollar deal with John Baker for the album. So now I'm like, fuck it.

[01:03:37.610] - Speaker 2
Who's John Baker?

[01:03:38.760] - Speaker 1
John Baker was running G Street Records. So John Baker, known for PM Dawn, I think he had Ziggy Marley, Gravediggers, and then he came and did the Rizzo album. So Chris Blackwell funded John. I see. G Street Records. And what you call him Bookbroker the Deal, Rages manager. The female, Bridget.

[01:04:01.560] - Speaker 2
Oh, Bridget?

[01:04:02.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So Bridget had did the deal. So you don't know what you don't know. And so hip hop, my biggest record deal was the Wu-Tang second album, which is the $4 million deal. Most artists were getting 300,000, maybe 600,000. A million was LL. You know what I mean? So we were able to broke a $4 million deal for Woutan. I thought I was the man. Then I met Bridget and she said, People are talking about you should do your own album. This is after the tour. People like you. The fans like you and the industry likes you. I'm reliable. You know what I mean? I was like, well, I'm doing good by myself. I want to do an album. I got so many allies. I'm with Leo, I got Steve, I got Wendy. She said, well, how much you think of what's the album can you get it? I said, I don't know. I'll go get two million at least. I know I could do that. She said, what if I could get you five? I was like, what? Five million? That's more than Wootang. She said, no. She said, you're getting hip hop numbers.

[01:05:15.110] - Speaker 1
I could get you rock and roll numbers. So I didn't know that, that rock and roll.

[01:05:19.990] - Speaker 2
I didn't know that either.

[01:05:21.850] - Speaker 1
But weren't there some artist in the rock? I don't know.

[01:05:26.650] - Speaker 2
I really have no idea.

[01:05:28.350] - Speaker 1
Well, that's what she exposed to me, whether it was a myth or a magic, it happened. Yeah, that's great. I actually gave a lot of the money back because when I signed the deal, I did sign as Ruzza. You know what know what I mean? No. It meant that I didn't own the Rizzo name anymore. You sign a record deal, the Rizzo becomes part of that company. It's like, anytime I want to do the Rizzo, they got the right to that. Oh, I see. And I was like, Nobody going to own the Rizzo. Philosophically. And it was like, No, what do you mean? You signed the deal. It's like a blockchain, like that. If you want to record, you got to hit, you put your five, you run, you go through your five sequence. I said, No, it doesn't feel right for somebody to own the Rizzo. I don't even own the Rizzo. And I said, What do you mean? And I told my lawyer, I was like, We got to get the Rizzo out of this. Bobby could stay.

[01:06:28.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And Bobby's the one who's delivering the record. Yeah.

[01:06:32.430] - Speaker 1
And they was like, Well, you want to what? I said, I'll buy it back. I want to buy Rizla back. They said, Okay, a couple of million dollars, you could buy it back. I said, I'll buy it back. They didn't believe it. I did it right before Christmas, too. I'm like, Who? Get my name back. I will not get my name back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let the Rizla be the Rizla. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I know we're having a pretty interesting conversation here, and I'm so comfortable with you because your travel. The thing about life, right? You've traveled, bro. You know what I mean? And your travel is the road you pass and the destination that you've achieved, right? Mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, economically, socially, all these ways of achieving puts you at a certain seat. And so I travel so far as well. So then when two people meet at that certain seat, you know what I mean? It's just like it's a different type of conversation. It's like, I don't even be around people that none of this even begins to fluctuate out of me. So know that. And it's a pleasure to build what you on it.

[01:07:40.200] - Speaker 2
I appreciate that.

[01:07:41.860] - Speaker 1
But yeah, the real thing, going back to the beginning of our conversation, the whole different artistic curiosity or the way that I said different personalities is definitely an entity of energy, which is interesting. Rihanna names her son Risa. Her son is named Risa. I was like, it's very interesting because I don't use the name as much. You know what I mean? I use it, but not as much as I used it when I was using it. And maybe, imagine 20 years from now and let's say, because I don't think the Rizla is just a name. I think it's a title. I think it's an entity. I think it's something. Not being superstitious here.

[01:08:27.040] - Speaker 2
No, I understand.

[01:08:28.020] - Speaker 1
But imagine if he It does embody that. Because the result of the job is to resurrect, to bring something back. You know what I mean? To help us see what we missed. You know what I mean? And in a hip hop way, hip hop was everything but hip hop for a moment. Not in disrespect to all our greats who are adding on to it, and it can be considered part of hip hop culture. But it wasn't hip hop. It was what it was, but it had to go into the category of hip hop. The same thing happened with rock at the moment, it's like, that's not rock, but that's all that rock is given, and that's rock. But it wasn't, right? It's just like somebody always comes, entity or come, whether it's in any form or jazz guy, somebody will come there to be like, Yo, oh, that's the pieriform. That's what we forgot. Then we rebuild again.

[01:09:23.520] - Speaker 2
How do you describe your relationship to hip hop now?

[01:09:29.730] - Speaker 1
I I think my relationship to hip hop now is one foot in, one foot out. One foot in because I'm founded in it, and I'm always striving to somehow find a new path for it. And that's because there's so many people in hip hop, especially from young people. And I even point even more, hip hop is seen to be, it's been classified because of the majority of hip hop practitioners are Black. So it seems like, let's say 80%, at least 75% is Black. And you have so many of these youths striving to be in it, but all striving like crabs in the barrel for that one path of it. And so my foot that's in it is always trying to show another path. My foot that's out it, making movies and shit. You know what I mean?

[01:10:30.790] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and classical music.

[01:10:31.900] - Speaker 1
Classical music. Just expressing. And even by me doing the classical, I would hope that somebody from hip hop understand that when you're making a beat, you're making a beat. But when you're composing something, you're composing something and start composing your beats. Dre said it on one of his little interviews. He pointed out how a beat Beatmaker is different from a producer because a beatmaker makes them beat, but then he has to produce the record. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know that one of the greatest producers from the culture in multiple genres yourself. That's how I see myself, one foot in, one foot out.

[01:11:18.860] - Speaker 2
Do you feel like everything you make, films, classical music, books, somehow still are tangentially related to hip hop?

[01:11:36.480] - Speaker 1
I do think that. I hope it's not my ego saying it.

[01:11:39.250] - Speaker 2
No, I think that's true, too.

[01:11:40.550] - Speaker 1
Okay, I hope it's not my ego saying that.

[01:11:41.800] - Speaker 2
Because I think when you're established in hip hop, it's a way of looking at the world that you don't let go of. It doesn't disappear when you're working on another genre.

[01:11:51.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think while they say hip hop is a culture, it's a way of life. Even as we're chilling, we still got a swag that's going to be way different than our peers when they see it. Even when I show up to the symphony hall, I'm a little swag, a little different. You know what I mean? And the cool thing about it, even if you look at... I think M&M is another good example for us. Just use him as it because he's a great artist. It's the same. If M&M shows up, he's hip hop. Even though he could be It could be a thousand white guys there, a thousand artists there, a thousand musicians. He's hip hop. M&m is hip hop, motherfucker.

[01:12:36.900] - Speaker 2
Okay? Yeah.

[01:12:38.230] - Speaker 1
That's what hip hop is. It's something else. I like the one foot in, one foot out because I'm never going to take both feet out. I can't. I don't think I could get away with it. When I get away with it, meaning it's already in my blood.

[01:12:52.790] - Speaker 2
It's in you. Tell me about you made an album that there was only one copy in existence of Yeah, that's a whole another chamber. Tell me the story.

[01:13:03.430] - Speaker 1
Man, that's a lot.

[01:13:04.690] - Speaker 2
How did the idea happen?

[01:13:06.240] - Speaker 1
My student, my student Silver Rings, I let them in to the temple, the world, and let him in. And let him sit by the door, give them a lot of trust, maybe too much. And It was almost like my student challenged me. And was doing things that was not pure in the sense of our relationship, in the sense of the conduct that I would expect from him. But yet doing something in the cause of what he believed was the right cause of Wu-Tang. And in that process, we are accumulating songs, vibes, moments. And after the accumulation of so much, it was two ideas we he was tangling with. One idea was I wanted to make a better tomorrow in theory, practice, music, everything. I just thought that was that's what the world needed. And in the process of doing that, I also wanted to centralize the idea of a Wu-Tang item. The centralization of it became a physical form, where I first thought this, that I'll make an album that will be a piece of jewelry. That'll be either Bluetooth or USB to you. But you had to have this. It's the only way you can have it.

[01:15:28.980] - Speaker 2
At that point, were you You were thinking it would be one of them or no? You were thinking that the delivery system for the album would be the bracelet, let's say. Yes. But you would buy it like you would buy an album in the old days.

[01:15:40.160] - Speaker 1
But very high priced. I see. Very high priced and very well made.

[01:15:47.040] - Speaker 2
Limited luxury item that you could physically wear, but that you could also play it. If you didn't have that, you could not play it. Yeah. He wasn't a part of this.

[01:15:59.160] - Speaker 1
Understood. You know what I mean? And you wore it with an honor, a badge of honor. Then, talking with Silver Rings, somehow he had got... It was almost like He got wind of what I was doing with all these peers. And then he sent me an image that was close to my image. And I was like, Okay, we got to meet. And then when we met, he was like, I didn't get it from your image. It's some inspiration I had as well. I said, Well, what should we do with that? He said, Well, we should just make it singular. I was like, make it singular? Can we meditate on that? And I meditated on it. But I didn't decide to do it. It wasn't until, and this is I have to say this story here. It wasn't until the Wolf did a quick European run, and while we was working on it better tomorrow, we had maybe four or five songs. And while we was doing it, we all got into an argument about my direction. You know what I mean? It was chewing me up. We should put that one out there. The Silver Rings one.

[01:17:27.950] - Speaker 1
That should sound like a real Who album. All the old beats and old sounds and all that shit, that sound like a real Who album. First of all, how did you hear it? It's supposed to be secret. I just listened to them. Then I called me and said, You fucking said, No, no, no, no, no, to make the most of something. And what's the best way? And I went with his idea more than my idea, which was make it singular. And then I said, Well, if we make it singular, we got to wait then. I said, So we're going to just hold it. And I'll put out a better tomorrow first and see what the world wants to do. And if the world don't respond, then we hit them with that. I think one of the fascinating things is where I probably want to delimit it to maybe a select amount. It have the people that really feel the wool have this emblem first at a high level and then maybe, let's just say, hypothetically, maybe first that this thing cost you $10,000 and it's yours and it's made of fine metals and it's not cheap.

[01:19:06.870] - Speaker 1
It's wearable. As if you would have bought it from Tiffany's and you could pass it to your child. The value will increase. Then have a version, of course, that you could pay $100 for it and all that, and eventually have the catalog on your wrist. And then the idea of abandoning that to centralizing it to one in that box, in that case. And I wrote it with that, but I put a time on it. And then once the time came and it seemed like, Yo, you know what? And the Who did it as well. A Better Tomorrow, which you worked on yourself, right? Thank you. We did a song here, Shane Will I. A Better Tomorrow, why it wasn't the '90s sound of the Who Boom Bap? It definitely was the Wu in a mature form as men. I think it has its merit as something if you're a Wu fan and a music fan, it's something that you should give it a shot. But at the time, the Wu also wasn't into it. You know what I mean? I'm going to diverge from the story and give you another substory to this thing, which is so funny about my life.

[01:20:28.700] - Speaker 1
So the Wu was not into this When you were making it, they weren't into it? Yeah. I mean, through the whole process, making it, it's weird because we made it. It's like, we fucking made it. And I understand the woo. The woo wants to be as threatening as the Wu always is. The Wu music is pretty threatening and pretty fucking brain of motherfucking workers. You know what I mean? But I was like, that's how we felt as kids. How do you feel as a man? It's impossible to feel the same way, or is it possible. Maybe I was wrong.

[01:21:01.730] - Speaker 2
No, but it would likely feel disingenuous if that's not the way you're living.

[01:21:07.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Or maybe I'm the one that's out here, went from the first album, Goatmeat, to by the time we got the liquid sports, I'm only eating turkey burgers. By the time we get the Wutain Forever, I'm only eating fish. By the time we finish that album, I'm vegan. So Well, maybe it's me, and I accept that. But I thought we all was growing at a certain rate, and maybe we were, but musically, we didn't need to, and they disagreed on me, and I respect that. The scientists always agree and disagree. But what happened was Rolling Stone offer us to cover a Rolling Stone. This time, us, all of us. The last time we was on the cover of a Rolling Stone, it was just Rizla and Zack. And then the time after that was maybe me and five other rock and roll bands for that big summer tour cover they do. Maybe I think, I don't know if Nath was with me on that day, but it never been the entire Wutain clan on the cover of Rolling Stone. And they was like, We're going to do it. And I get to New York, and the only one after the shoot is me.

[01:22:20.640] - Speaker 1
And I'm like, oh, shit. And Rolling Stone is there. So it's me, the writer, the photographers, and no Who. And no warning, because I flew in from LA. So I'm like, okay, that's crazy. So I immediately, two days later, turn around, fly back. And while I'm flying back, I get a I had this script that my agent had gave me. And I started reading on the plane. It's a story about a female emcee who wants to increase her lyrical ability by studying poetry and putting more meaning into the songs. But the other MCs and her crew, all guys, they don't want to. They want to stay hood and they want to live in gangster fantasies. And she wants to expand and they don't want her to. And she ends up getting kicked out of the group, leaving the group and finding a whole new thing for herself. I was like, That sounds like me. It's good. And so I land in LA, and soon I called my agent like, Yo, did they find a director for that movie yet? He's like, They're still looking. A couple of names. I said, Give me a meeting. And they got me a meeting, and I got the job, and I did it.

[01:23:43.880] - Speaker 1
It was my second film called Love Beats Rhymes. You know what I mean? Which is- A good experience?

[01:23:48.720] - Speaker 2
Great experience.

[01:23:50.250] - Speaker 1
The producer from that movie is actually a producer on my new movie. Great. It was a great experience, but beyond my lead actress. But great experience. I'm sorry to say that it's crazy how things go. It's crazy how the rebound to it. I rebounded well. Now I'm going to do this movie.

[01:24:08.240] - Speaker 2
I also wanted to just ask you, was the Who not showing up and not telling you they weren't showing up unusual or is that something that might have happened in the past?

[01:24:18.020] - Speaker 1
That was heaviest, I think. I think nobody's showing up as deep.

[01:24:25.660] - Speaker 2
Yeah, maybe half wouldn't show.

[01:24:26.990] - Speaker 1
Half is always an equation. It's always somebody missing.

[01:24:30.990] - Speaker 2
Too many people. Yeah.

[01:24:33.110] - Speaker 1
When you look at our early photos, you'll see everybody's not in that photo. I can respect that. But nobody's showing up. I just got to accept this, and I'll do accept it. I'm totally wrong. Because if nobody shows up and I show up, then I'm wrong. That means I'm making the mistake here. What I mean by that is that it's been agreed that what I'm doing is not right. The product is not right. The vibe is not right. How do I know? It's been agreed unanimously, so I'm on.

[01:25:07.700] - Speaker 2
Do you believe they discussed it?

[01:25:10.350] - Speaker 1
I don't know. No, I don't know. I don't know how they... I didn't even inquire. You know what I mean? I just accept it. Okay. All right. I'll fuck that one up.

[01:25:19.730] - Speaker 2
Have the Who done anything since then together?

[01:25:22.670] - Speaker 1
As an album or music?

[01:25:23.990] - Speaker 2
Anything.

[01:25:24.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah, we do concerts and tours.

[01:25:26.600] - Speaker 2
And how does that work?

[01:25:28.850] - Speaker 1
Well, the funny thing is I said, I'll jump ahead then. I was going to hit you with the... What happens now is that the next move, though, is once upon a time in Shaalin. Because a better tomorrow comes out. It does maybe 30, 40,000 units the first week, which is not that great for a Wu-Chang. And since we were way on out of the world. And so I'm looking at the Wu and I'm looking at the fans, I'm looking at the system. I'm like, okay, launch the missile. Once upon a time in Shaolin, nobody get it. Not even the Wu got it. Nobody gets it now. So I got some riserism in there, some All this other shit. And then Silver Reings gets a platform because he becomes... His name is in the Wu world in a way that he never would have been in the Wu world. Good for him. He probably got the most out of it than all of us. You know what I mean? So that's that. But going to the modern day, the war, our brothers. So what happened was there was a five-year plan in the beginning, Rick. And then in 2017, 2018, I think, I made another five-year plan, and I pitched it to everybody.

[01:26:49.940] - Speaker 1
When I said to them, If you're not paying attention, hip hop is forgetting us. That's what you mean? I said, I've seen two documentaries on hip hop. They jumped right over us. I seen them go from LL to Biggie. How do you get to Biggie without going to a wall? You can't. You know what I mean? It's like we set that wick that opened that up. If we don't go platinum in 1993, he doesn't go platinum in 1994. Nas don't go platinum in 1995. The money dictates the energy of where the system is taking bets. If we don't show and prove, then the money ain't coming to New York. It's going to stay right out here in the West, which was doing very well for everybody. But they skipped us. Nobody saw it. And then they invited me to the show that was doing, I think it's called Hip hop Evolution or something like that. Season three. Now you're inviting the Wolf, and I declined, but they still got reanghosted. To do it. And I told everybody, declined, but they still did it. And so I said, We got to tell our own story. They're skipping us.

[01:28:11.080] - Speaker 1
And so I said, What we're going to do is we're going to do a documentary, and we're going to do a TV series, then we're going to do a tour. It's going to be a five-year plan. Two five-year plans, I said. That's going to actually, I'm going to do a they raced with these years. It's going to go five years here. And in the middle of this plan, the second five-year plan is starting. And so within seven years, everybody should be millionaires again, should be able to ride off in the sunset. And I myself, who was actually doing pretty well, can also lay my head in my mansion at night knowing that I did all I can to make sure my brother's legacy was protected and that their economics and their families were protected unless they fuck it up. But this is the shot that I'm going to take. And everybody was I was like, Everybody agreed. Even though I had bumps along the road, once you agree with me, I'm cool with all the stuff you do. Just try to stop me because it's like, You already agreed. My heart is impurity and content of this is what we're doing.

[01:29:32.000] - Speaker 1
We ended up doing Mikes and Men, Emmy nominated, big for hip hop and big for the culture. Then we do the Hulu series, 30 Hours, no hip hop, not even music people have gotten that much time of introspective creative art on their work. We do the tour. The tour was the part, was the parallel thing because the tour was supposed to lead to a Vegas residency. The tour, New York State of mind, one of the biggest tours in hip hop for the last five years. The Vegas residency works. First hip hop group to have a residency in Vegas, which close to 90 % sell-out rate. We will announce, I guess I don't want to announce it right here, but we got a big announcement coming for her for 2025. Yeah. And so to go back, you said, What are we doing? And now, the great art that all of my brothers possess, actually, I'm seeing it even more now.

[01:30:50.400] - Speaker 2
Everybody's individual works are growing based on this. Right.

[01:30:53.950] - Speaker 1
No, everybody individually are settling into this manhood thing.

[01:30:59.680] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:31:00.390] - Speaker 1
That's what's happening. That's beautiful. It's like somebody coming in. For instance, nobody's coming in like, move that, move that, move that, move that. They're coming in like, Okay. You can put a little yellow on that. You see what I mean? The creativity that's now presented to them through my lens. First of all, I've refined it. I think making movies and TV shows has put my brain at this level. So if you would have came to our Vegas show, you would have seen... You'd have been proud for hip hop. Because not with all the great sets and all that which hip hop has gotten to. No, it's almost like your watching a hip hop play. You know what I mean? Even on a New York state of mind, I don't know if you made it any of those, but when you see that it wasn't usually when you got that many artists, it's a battle. No. I He was able to, along with my partner Nas, of course, being in an agreement with me, we were able to meld it together. I'll never forget when Busta came to the first day, because he signed on late.

[01:32:13.670] - Speaker 1
But when he got there, I was like, Yeah, this is this. I had play. And I did his whole logo. He's like, He never came to no concert with somebody and the other act.

[01:32:26.810] - Speaker 2
Caring about him. Yeah.

[01:32:29.230] - Speaker 1
When they I came, they didn't hook up early. So their joint was like, well, it's Dela, so I love them. So I was just like, let me just spend two or three days. Look, Look at this now. They was like, yeah. I said, we're going to start with three. That's the magic number. That's going to have a crowd like, oh, shit, Dela. And then you end with it. And on a three-time, it takes It's a magic number. So for the whole show, I'm giving them this, but on the last song, I give them on that screen. And I put a true boy up there. Then you go out like that, bro.

[01:33:09.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, beautiful.

[01:33:10.770] - Speaker 1
Let's put a classroom behind them. You know what I mean? So my creativity is where it's at as a filmmaker and all that. And now the team have that extra respect. And when they come to say something, it's not the challenge. It's actually creatively to add on. And that's That's how we did our first album. It was competitive, but it was always adding on a layer. Mef came in, was like, I said, I need a hook. He's not on the song. Guess what? Cash rule, everything. He wrote that, and he glued it, and he had no ego in doing that. You know what I mean? I was like, Yo, the Lyric He's had on Cream was from his own song, where he had three verses. I was like, No, just give me that first verse of that song. It took out six or eight lines. Yeah. No argument. You know what I mean? So hopefully, I feel like we're back to that because we're men. You know what I mean? It's hard to be a man even if you're 40, 50 years old, sometimes, you still have this youth boy in you that want to- Especially with your friends from when you were young.

[01:34:23.610] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It's different when it's someone that you meet as an adult. Yeah. It's like you revert back.

[01:34:30.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's like your parent. Exactly. You go home and your parent, Mom, you got any... Mom, hello, you got apple pie? Exactly. You feel... Yeah, it's that.

[01:34:44.970] - Speaker 2
What's your favorite Wu-Tang song?

[01:34:50.680] - Speaker 1
Wu-tang Clang, right? I don't know. I tell you the one I feel really proud I'm proud of as a producer. I feel really proud of Bring the Ruckus. I just feel like nobody did that before me.

[01:35:08.010] - Speaker 2
We're going to listen to Bring the Ruckus.

[01:35:09.830] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[01:35:13.050] - Speaker 2
Shalane Shadowboxing.

[01:35:15.220] - Speaker 1
And the Wu-Tang sword style.

[01:35:17.690] - Speaker 2
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous.

[01:35:23.400] - Speaker 1
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?

[01:35:27.800] - Speaker 2
I'm guard. I'll let you try my Wutang style.

Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse. My clock burst, leaving a hearse, I did worse. I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk. Your head rush, fly like Egyptian muscle. Oh, shit.

[01:37:16.990] - Speaker 1
The roughness, just the rudeness. Fuck is. Rack run, I'm early in salt off the top. More than what? Mustard shots, you're not like a stun gun. I'm hectic. I break it with the quickness. Say it on them like a phone. In competition, get blown by this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the Rissa. Charged like a bull and got pulled like a trigger.

They're more deadly than the stroke of an ax. Chopping through your back, giving by, standard's hard attached. Niggers try to fling.

[01:38:15.760] - Speaker 1
Tell me who is 'em. I'll blow up this fucking prism, make it a vicious act of terrorism. You want to bring it, so fuck it. Come on and bring the rockets. Then I'll provoke niggas to kick pockets.

So bring it on. So bring it on. So bring it on. So bring it on. So bring it on. So bring it on.

[01:39:05.540] - Speaker 2
What do you remember about recording it?

[01:39:17.770] - Speaker 1
So many memories on that one, Rick.

[01:39:21.640] - Speaker 2
During the course of making the album, when did it happen?

[01:39:25.170] - Speaker 1
I feel like maybe in the middle, far as the rendition of what it ended up being. But I also think that the way we were recording that album, that pieces of it was happening during the process. Carlos Best was the engineer then, Ethan was the engineer, and Carlos was like, just put the drums in the elevator shaft. You know what I mean? Record that shit. You know what I mean? That process of making the album and also experimenting with what's happening through the thing. But one thing about it that I really love for me in memory is that the willingness of unorthodoxness that as a creator, I was cool with. Do you hear that sound? That's the CD skipping. I sampled it. It plays in that track about 10 times. That's my horns. It sounded like a horn. It sounded like it's my horn. It became my fucking horns.

[01:40:36.470] - Speaker 2
It was just a CD skipping that you just happened to notice when it was skipping, that sounds like horns. I'm going to use it.

[01:40:42.730] - Speaker 1
That type of freedom of grabbing and playing. I love it so much because it's a lot of frequencies in it, but if you play that shit loud, it's ever changing. You got the four MCs, but none of them rhyme to the same thing. You know what I mean? It's always- Even the music under the hook changes.

[01:41:06.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:41:07.320] - Speaker 1
It was just it was composing without knowing. You know what I mean? That's what it was.

[01:41:13.520] - Speaker 2
How would you decide who would go on what tracks?

[01:41:16.470] - Speaker 1
At that time, I considered the MCs as instruments as well.

[01:41:20.490] - Speaker 2
I see.

[01:41:21.130] - Speaker 1
You know what I mean? I knew certain voices. Then also, I knew my brothers pretty well, more than they knew each other because they all was my buddies. Even if they weren't buddies with each other yet. I see.

[01:41:34.750] - Speaker 2
What was the first scoring job you did in Hollywood?

[01:41:40.600] - Speaker 1
My first score was Jim Jamus Ghost Dog. It went well. Critically acclaimed him.

[01:41:48.420] - Speaker 2
And what was the experience like?

[01:41:50.620] - Speaker 1
It was great. Jim was a cool guy. I didn't know shit, bro. Absolutely.

[01:41:55.420] - Speaker 2
He's a great guy.

[01:41:56.180] - Speaker 1
I didn't know shit. I was bringing music at one o'clock in the morning and shit. Drinking 40s and ODB in the car with me. Jim always was like, it was like a spy movie. I'll be needing the music and he'll be like, Yo, what are you going to be Wednesday at one? Because the editing in the movies is over at 6:00. Okay, it's a schedule here. But he was cool. It was cool. We stayed brothers. I was just on I was on the phone with him last week. Then there, I guess I did a good enough job that I got some critical respect. Then when I met Quentin, my next one is Kill Bill. Great.

[01:42:41.900] - Speaker 2
How was that experience?

[01:42:43.220] - Speaker 1
Changed my life because I saw in another artist the epitome of art and found my direction in art.

[01:42:52.810] - Speaker 2
Would you say you were inspired by the way he worked?

[01:42:55.940] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I was inspired by the The brain capacity that he had to use to make his world come to life. I was doing that with 12 people in the studio. He's doing it with 200 people on a movie set. And at times, the good thing about it for me, when I met Quentin and I saw that his brain was a certain way, I was humble enough to ask him, Can I observe him? And he said, Yeah. He said, I'll be in China. Where if you want to come on over and help yourself. We was already friends. I flew to China. You know what I mean? Stayed a couple of days before I made myself known because I like to No broading to nobody. Then I was like, I'm Lawrence Bender. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, been in three days. I'll be here for two weeks. You're going to be here for two weeks? Yeah, I'm just chilling. You know what I mean? Oh, you don't need nothing. Just let me know who you guys going to be at. I'll show the set. I'll come every day after lunch and then stay for the rest of the day.

[01:44:07.010] - Speaker 1
Yeah, cool. And I was up there with the same composition notebook that I would write lyrics in. Now I'm writing ideas and the camera shit and all this shit. That's what helped me find my new path. And I wasn't there as a composer. I was there as an observer because I saw a like-minded man who have elevated his art to the highest level of art. A film, considerably, is the highest, most expensive form of art. It takes sound, music. It takes color, paintings, wardrobes, tempo, lyrics.

[01:44:56.120] - Speaker 2
I mean- Acting. Acting. A lot.

[01:44:59.960] - Speaker 1
Everything. Almost every... A good movie has every piece of art in it. Even... A name of weird art.

[01:45:07.740] - Speaker 2
Painting, let's say. It's in it.

[01:45:10.290] - Speaker 1
Your art director painted the whole fucking set. Give me one more.

[01:45:15.110] - Speaker 2
Dancing.

[01:45:16.770] - Speaker 1
That's why you love the whole Pulp fiction when John Chibouche dance with Uma Thurman, you're like, Yo.

[01:45:21.560] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:45:22.350] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's in it. He opened my brain to that. It wasn't until then it went to Japan. I didn't go to Japan. Then they went to Mexico, and I showed up in Mexico. Two weeks in Mexico. It was in Mexico, we spent a lot of nice time together, especially on the days off and all that. I remember someone, the producers was like, What is this guy doing here? That will give you a quick story.

[01:45:47.080] - Speaker 2
So you're really a student. You went as a student.

[01:45:50.410] - Speaker 1
I went as a student, and I would get your tea. If you would say, Yo, get the tea, I would get the tea. One thing that was funny, I'll just share this with you. Normally, let's say that there's three tables, and this table is Quentin, the producers. This is the lead actress. Maybe Ethan Hart came to town. That's that table. This table could be people from the crew all that, and all that, and all that, and all that. I was at that table.

[01:46:19.900] - Speaker 2
The third table. Yeah.

[01:46:21.630] - Speaker 1
And then after some nights, I think Larry McCuglin, one of the greatest Steadicam, did all the Steadicam for Scorsese and Goodfellers. In fact, his family invented the Steadicam. Wow. Okay. They call him Larry Vision. But I became cool with him. I didn't have the same schedule as everybody, so I could end up drinking with anybody. But anyway, now I'm at that table. But I did overhear some bigger like, What is this guy doing here? Somebody asked, Quintin, what is Quintin said, I don't know. I haven't figured out exactly what Bobby's going to be doing as part of the film. He's here observing, but I haven't figured out what role he's going to play. And then maybe it's two more days before the end of Quint advise me to this table. And he makes the announcement of Bobby's going to be my first composer. He's never used a composer before. So he's going to be my first composer for my film, and he's going to help produce my soundtrack.

[01:47:31.520] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:47:32.620] - Speaker 1
I was like, Hey. The funny thing, there was a guy there, I think, who flew in because he wanted to be it. He had his guitar and everything. But anyway, that continued to lead me down the path.

[01:47:51.290] - Speaker 2
How many have you done since?

[01:47:53.690] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:47:54.480] - Speaker 2
A lot. Yeah.

[01:47:55.480] - Speaker 1
I know the TV series. I got two Emmy nominations for music, BAFTA.

[01:48:02.590] - Speaker 2
How's it different working on a score versus working on tracks?

[01:48:07.040] - Speaker 1
I mean, a score, you have to service the film and remove your personal What you want personally. It has to service the film. It's not about you. At first, I thought it was about service in the director. I thought that, but it wasn't that. On Kill Bill, I thought it was serving the director. I never worked for nobody before since I was- And neither did he.

[01:48:34.610] - Speaker 2
That also is interesting. Yeah, he never worked with nobody. He never worked with somebody to do score. So in some ways, you found your way together. Yeah.

[01:48:42.160] - Speaker 1
I'm the Rizzo right now. I'm the producer. I call the shots. I'm in a situation to where I play something and they're like, no, that don't work, Bobby. I went through a situation where it didn't work all week. Yeah, And I was like, Oh, fuck this shit. My mind. You know what I mean? And then I just let myself be free. And the scene that didn't work, he burst in the womb one day. That's it. Whatever you was doing right there, that's what we need for the scene where she fights the crazy 88. And then it was like a moment where that scene was out of the movie, but they didn't tell me. And I'm working on it, and And I'm like, it was Friday. Friday is my day to show shit. And mind you, I'm in the editing for... Editing is 20 weeks. So I don't get there as... My time is still hip hop time. So I'm not getting there like everybody else is fucking 9:00 AM. You're not there in the morning. Yeah, 9:00 AM. So I'm after lunch, but I'm hanging till dinner. I even hang till midnight, but I'm not getting there before lunch.

[01:49:55.560] - Speaker 1
But the scene was out of the film, but I didn't know. And Friday, I said, Oh, check this out. He didn't listen. And I took an old sample that we had used, a Xanofil sample, and then chopped it up to the scene. And it was like, You just saved the scene. I was like, What?

[01:50:16.060] - Speaker 2
So it was going to be out, but because you liked the music, it made it in a movie.

[01:50:19.590] - Speaker 1
Not only that, the music was such a good crate dig. It was the music in the trailer. It was a great dig. Wow. So cool.

[01:50:29.390] - Speaker 2
Have you ever Have you studied martial arts philosophy?

[01:50:33.840] - Speaker 1
Of course, yes. Yeah, of course. I studied martial arts philosophy even today. I was actually studying... There's a filmmaker named Laurel Carlung, who made the movie 36 Chambers. He's a director of it. He directed about 18 films. I just been studying him for the last two weeks. He passed away in 2013. I think he's one of the greatest directors that ever lived. And he's a real kung fu master from the fourth generation of the Hong Kong form. I actually learned the Hong Kong form myself. I was trained by his classmate. And when I was The Man with the Iron Fist, they gave me this classmate. I read it from a book when I was a kid. So as a kid, one of the first books that I bought was the Hong Kong form. I'm 14 years old, and I just used the book and tried to figure it out. Then in real life, I get a Hangar master to come teach me, who's the brother of my favorite director, and Gordon Lewis's brother as well, and Gordon Lewis in my movie. The universe is crazy, right? Yes, I study martial arts, philosophy, philosophy, and I would prescribe it that it should actually be added to a curriculum in school.

[01:51:50.160] - Speaker 1
Because discipline, spirituality, physical training of yourself, mental training of yourself, understanding yourself. Martial art is actually the art of understanding yourself. It's so important. And the philosophy, whether you're Shaolin or Wu-Tang or Herme, or even if you want to just take it to Japan and do karate, it's all to build the individual and the community. If you build yourself first, you become valuable to your community. You could either be the one that uphold the community or inspire the community or even defend the community.

[01:52:34.150] - Speaker 2
When you study it, you learn the physical forms, but the philosophy is always taught along with the physical forms, yes?

[01:52:42.580] - Speaker 1
Should be. So I can't speak for every teacher. And for me, the philosophy... In fact, Wu Tang itself, if you go through the history of what Wu Tang was or is, the story is that this monk leaves Shaolin. And he goes to the Wudong Mountain, and here he becomes enlightened. And he's not sitting there throwing punches all day. He's sitting still, and he's running it through his mind. You know what I mean? And so he's taking the Daoist approach versus the Buddhist approach. And he actually ends up melding the two. And you meditate a lot and you sit. It's actually If you have some physical training and then you could sit there and in small spaces, move your muscles and have your mind move everything you're supposed to move. In small spaces, you'll be just as strong as a I'm not going to talk a lift in weights. You know what I mean? That's the Wu-Tang way. The Shaolin way, of course, they throw a thousand punches.

[01:53:55.750] - Speaker 2
Tell me about writing.

[01:53:56.620] - Speaker 1
In which capacity for some type of content to come out of you?

[01:54:03.990] - Speaker 2
What happens?

[01:54:06.210] - Speaker 1
I think three levels come out of me as an artist. One is my personal experiences. One is my observation. And one of the strongest one is my imagination. And then if you're blessed, it's inspiration. It has nothing to do with you.

[01:54:24.490] - Speaker 2
But you don't aim for the inspiration. That comes- Yeah.

[01:54:27.570] - Speaker 1
I don't aim for neither, none of them. But if I'm forced to write, like I say right now, you go, Oh, let's write a song. I will rely upon myself and my experiences. A lot of my Bobby Digital lyrics are more experienced than some of my Rizel lyrics.

[01:54:45.170] - Speaker 2
The rest of the lyrics are more philosophical. Yeah.

[01:54:48.650] - Speaker 1
Bobby Digital, I had a verse, I'll give you a few lines. It's a gangsta shit a little bit. For a Shelleys whip through his belly, they shot him right outside of Mike's deli. Dip to the telly, caught my bitch up on the celly. Bobby what? I'm probably nuts. I walk strange, I talk strange. A long range, sniper aim, will Swiss cheese your brain. I don't sleep. I don't eat meat. I rest twice a week. I could speak without moving my lips. I got 50 pairs of sneakers, fingerprint proof rubber grips, hollow-tip clips, 8oz bud nips. I sip and I love barbecue chips. That's just me. I clock a bird from the block straight away from her flock. She just crossed near the bus I had a snapper, I twist the top off. She kept her hair processed, no panties underneath her dress, a small link ankle bracelet. She had polo frames. My shades had no name. The popol came. I slowed my game. My thick gold chain made their eyes flame, so I stood up against the bodega's gate and stayed straight. She had a perfect figure, 8 shape. I couldn't wait to bust her grape with my apple head.

[01:55:57.930] - Speaker 1
Anyway, so that's So that's easy to write because I could just go through myself like, Oh, I saw that girl. I could write. But then if you're writing the preexistence of the mathematical biochemical equation is the manifestation of rock, plant, air, fire, and water, which are in the basic formation solid, liquid, and gasses that formed the landmasses and the space catalysts. And all matter that exists must first be observed through a physical comprehension, but it takes your nerves to be struck. That's the result. You know what I mean?

[01:56:28.730] - Speaker 2
Big difference. Yeah. Yeah, really different. It's cool that you gave them different characters, essentially.

[01:56:37.010] - Speaker 1
Then when writing a movie, well, I learned from the Tarantino school. In a way, I think I definitely will use my imagination, but also hip hop. Quentin is a hip hop director.

[01:56:54.300] - Speaker 2
He's a music director. Tell me how.

[01:56:55.500] - Speaker 1
Because he have a catalog of thousands of movies in his head.

[01:57:01.860] - Speaker 2
So he's sampling ideas from things he's seen. Yeah.

[01:57:06.100] - Speaker 1
And I find myself doing the same. Yeah. Let me say, inspiration, we don't have nothing to do with that. That That's even deeper than Rizzo in a way of philosophical because... Mccartney said, A lot of great artists say it. It shows up in your dream. You wake up with it. For me, the wake up has been actually, that's why we have this album of Ballet Thou Mut. I woke up without words, woke up with music in me.

[01:57:44.760] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your relationship to piano. When did you learn to play piano?

[01:57:51.340] - Speaker 1
I mean, I always liked the piano, always had one. Never took formal training. Just always just fiddled with it, right? By fiddling with it, I just got better and better. Loved it since I got the A. S. Once I got the EPS, that was the keyboard. I realized that I'm more of that type of musical creator when it comes to producing or songwriting. And so, yeah, I love the piano for years.

[01:58:18.800] - Speaker 2
Once you got into it, how much time would you sit at the piano, typically?

[01:58:22.570] - Speaker 1
I spent the most time at the piano during the pandemic, I think. Maybe a year before that. But I'm the guy that you will in the room, do tours or whatever, even in a mediocre way. If they had a piano in the lobby, I'm there. And the chicks were with me, are there. And if I only know two chords, I'm playing those two chords for an hour. I just got addicted to it. I remember Wutang had our first album out or coming out, whatever, and we was all in the Bay Area. They put us in the Oakwoods, and we stayed there. And there was this great piano Store. It's in San Francisco. There's a great piano store that was somewhere downtown San Fred. And I remember going in it, and they couldn't afford a piano yet. Didn't even know a piano would be $20,000, $30,000. You know what I They thought maybe at that time, the biggest, most expensive keyboard would be two grand. So the guy tell me the price. Then there was some gentleman buying one. He looked a little bit like it could have been a I'm a business Wall Street guy, but we're in a Bay Area, so I don't know his profession.

[01:59:33.550] - Speaker 1
But he was testing the pianos, and I didn't know nothing. But I wasn't shocked. I was like, Yo, can you show me something? How long you been playing? He said, I've been playing for 10 years. I said, How long it take you to get good? He said, Still ain't good. I said, Well, what could you show somebody like me? He said, Actually, nothing. And I was cool with that. You know what I mean? But I I was like, I'm going to get one one day. But I did start reading Music Theory that year. That year? That year, 1996. I started to read at least Music Theory so I could play on my keyboards. And that's why I'm woutan However, you do hear cord progressions and turnarounds.

[02:00:18.280] - Speaker 2
What's the first piano you bought?

[02:00:20.340] - Speaker 1
The first one was a Yamaha Upright. Had a Disclaveia on it as well. Bought three of those in my life.

[02:00:27.920] - Speaker 2
And would you sit in it and play a lot? Yeah.

[02:00:31.370] - Speaker 1
My ex-wife, she fucked that piano up. There's a great story in my old neighborhood. You go to the piano store, they got a great story about the piano. She fucked it up.

[02:00:46.180] - Speaker 2
In what way?

[02:00:47.390] - Speaker 1
She beat the shit out of that piano, like hammering it. She knew I loved it. Oh, I see. Yeah, she destroyed that motherfucker. Then took it back to them because he had to get me a new one. And then I don't know what the fuck happened. She just told them, You know the Wutang? They had a crazy party. That story lived in the piano place for a long time until I... I actually never connected the story. I didn't want to go under the bus. But since then, wow. I got a piano in every home. Just put my first Steinway, actually, not even six months ago. I bought my first Steinway. Beautiful. Yeah.

[02:01:30.030] - Speaker 2
But we're lucky that we have a piano here.

[02:01:31.900] - Speaker 1
Yes, you do. You got a beautiful piano. You feel like- See if I could bring something out of me? Yeah, why not? Let's see what I could do. Well, you got a couple of pianos here. Yeah, what you're going to be like. Let's see what's going on here.

[02:02:59.920] - Speaker 1
This is basically the story of the ballet. What's happening in the ballet is that we start off in the key of C, which is Ionia. And then the relative minor of C It's A minor, right? And it becomes aolean. So C is Major, right? And then the next mode would be Dorian, which would normally be minor, right? In this key of C. But in my ballet, it's actually major, so it's more heroic. And we I follow throughout through these modes. And then once the Ionian went minor, it has to make it back to that major. And then I'll go through that whole thing. And the thing that works with the Ionian, working the modes back, is from the Ionian, the low crean. That diminished. And then from that diminished, you want to make it back. And you could do it any way. You could do it other ways. You could go Let me take that same concept and don't think about the modes I mean, think of the modes, but don't think about the key. So now I'm going to still do the same thing starting Ionean, right? But this here, it's not in the key, I see.

[02:05:44.780] - Speaker 1
It's more of a jazz type thing. Once again. Now I got to the key.

[02:06:59.920] - Speaker 2
How did the idea for the ballet come?

[02:07:09.060] - Speaker 1
From finding my old looks inside my Tommy Hilfiger duffle bag and then wanting to put music to the lyrics. But in a way, I didn't want to rap. When I rapped, I didn't want to rap over hip hop. I just wanted to have a different expression. And it just kept evolving into different iterations until I thought I was going to write a hip hop opera. And then it was a guy named Evan Lamberg, one of the presidents of Universal I know.

[02:07:45.230] - Speaker 2
I know Evan. I love Evan.

[02:07:46.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So Evan, I played maybe a couple of tracks of him when I was getting... Yeah, I'm working on my new opera. He's like, Opera? He said, Well, operas are usually in Italian, but that sounds like a ballet. Like a ballet is like the Nutcracker Suite or Peter and the Wolf. When he said that, I was like, That's crazy, because Peter and the Wolf was the first thing I studied When I was striving to be a composer, when I was striving to be a composer. When Jim Jammer said, I want you to compose my film, and I never composed a film, the first thing I did is went and studied Peter and the Wolf. And by studying Peter and the Wolf, it said that every instrument represented a character. The flute represented the bird, which makes sense because if you blow a flute, you can flutter. The tribone was representing the wolf. The tube of the elephant. Okay. That opened my brain to the fausts composing. Come back now, 20 years later, and I'm doing my ballet. I identified five with what Evan said, and then I pursued it as such. I said, okay. And I told my wife, no, I'm writing a ballet.

[02:09:10.800] - Speaker 1
And then I took the story that I had, which was about these six... One of my lyrics was about these six kids who... I'll give you the lyrics, you could chop it up. But this was written between the age of 14 and 19, all these lyrics. And one was called Joe is a Nerd. And it goes, who was this girl, was really quite fly. Brad was real cool when he was her guy. Lisa was freaky, they loved to have sex. Her brother name was Dexter, but they called them Dexter. His sister name was Monica, and she was a verge. Joe was just their friend, but he was a nerd. Brad bought the beer, Sue bought the smoke. Lisa had sheets. Dexter had coke. Joe was the type who didn't get high. No other Monica, but she was willing to try. Brad lit a blunt and passed it to Joe, said, Come on, man, smoking. And Joe said, No. What's wrong? Are you scared? Was asked by Sue. You are just a nerd. Joe said, That's not true. Monica said, Joe, just have a taste, as he puffed on the blunt and blew the smoke in his face.

[02:10:05.840] - Speaker 1
Now on Monica, Joe had a crush. He didn't want to smoke, but felt that he must. Like many we know, love made him a fool, so he took a pull to prove he was cool. Lisa was like, Yo, forget about Joe. They say, Hey, Dec, where the heck is the blow? He pulled out two grams. That is all that I bought. They said, It's more than enough. They proceeded to snort. Now, at this time, Joe had finished three beers, and Brad was like, Here, have another, you queer. And Joe was like, No, as he held his stomach and while facing Monica, he suddenly vomicked. She screamed, Oh, my God, shit, how absurd. And everyone laughed and said, Joe is a nerd. Joe is a nerd. Joe is a nerd. Joe felt embarrassed, so he did the bird. They chased him and ran and giggled and laughed. Through this abandoned house, then it was a sound of crashing glass. It was dark in the room, so Brad had to get a light, and he checked to see if Joe was all right. But when they found them, there was quarts of red blood spitting from his head, it's sprouting from his head.

[02:10:59.450] - Speaker 1
And Monica Decker said, Joey is dead, and they all started to run. They never mentioned this incident again to anyone. So that was a story that I was like, Okay, I'm going to do this. I'm going to write this into this thing, along with The other one I won't say to you.

[02:11:16.820] - Speaker 2
It's like a children's story, but an edgy children's story, I'll say. Yeah, basically.

[02:11:21.830] - Speaker 1
You know the Slick Rick time where those stories was happening. Yeah. Then I said, Okay, I can't get away with that. It don't sound right, teenagers. And so I wrote a story into a higher level of college students. When I did that, I said, okay, now I got these six college students. How can I tell this story? And I decided that I'll tell it through the musical mode. That's why I just went through that to show you. And it starts off with Ionia, who goes all the way through all the keys before she gets back to herself. And that's a ballet through mud. Because sometimes we got to go through all these different things. You know what I mean? You got to go through the mud. And what comes out of the mud in Buddhism, the Lotus. It grows out of the mud. And that's why the last song on that album is The Lotus and Rides.

[02:12:12.730] - Speaker 2
Have you performed it live?

[02:12:14.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah, we performed it live first before we recorded it, actually. I performed it in Colorado, the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. Two sold-out nights, which was great. Standing ovation, which was amazing for my spirit.

[02:12:28.630] - Speaker 2
Did you play piano or did you just compose and watch it?

[02:12:31.600] - Speaker 1
Just watch it. I don't play piano in front of people. My wife, kids, maybe, friends, but I love sharing. Me and my son, at my phone, I got so many recordings of like, okay, do you go three minutes? I go three minutes. Whatever happens. Don't worry about it. And we go. Sometimes we say something interesting, sometimes we don't. Taking the musical modes and telling the story, that's it.

[02:12:59.510] - Speaker 2
Beautiful. And then tell me about how you recorded it.

[02:13:03.240] - Speaker 1
Recorded it in Colorado in the Symphony Hall. Mixed mics, Newman.

[02:13:09.900] - Speaker 2
How was it different hearing it with an audience in the symphony hall versus how you imagined it when you played it on the piano in the first place?

[02:13:20.310] - Speaker 1
Incredible in all reality. Well, first of all, it was piano, then it goes to DAW, and then it gets written for the orchestra. But incredible. It's incredible because on a piano, you know that your tubas and your grass is all here, right? That's maybe the lowest grass. Your cello will start here, though. Then M. Your violins will be... You know your flusses But your flute could also get down here, but you could also have your oboes and your other woods down here. So you'll know that if you did a chord like this, C7, you can look at that and look at the range of that and what instruments fit here. If I did the... Or if I did the Actually, I'll do a D here, but I'll do an inversion. So now I got that flute. And then... So anyway, so thinking like that, right? But then when you hear it played by the musicians, it's 16 violins playing It's four flute players playing it. No, it's amazing. We had 60 pieces. And so it felt amazing. And they knew me. That's the other thing. Chris Dragon, our conductor, We had built a friendship already from some previous things.

[02:15:18.620] - Speaker 1
By the time we recorded it, we had performed it. We had rehearsed it. We had performed it to success multiple nights. And now it was maybe a A few months later, I feel like it could have been about four months later, I said, Okay, now we're going to record it. Now, the only difference that happened is that the original ballet was written with choir, but there's no choir on the album.

[02:15:44.000] - Speaker 2
And so The live performance, did you have choir?

[02:15:47.050] - Speaker 1
Yes, the live performance, it was choir as well.

[02:15:49.380] - Speaker 2
Is there a recording of the live? Yeah. Great.

[02:15:51.380] - Speaker 1
There might be one song that's on the bonus that has one song of the live. You could hear the crowd and all that shit. You have to figure out what instruments, but basically the human voice is hear to hear. I mean, naturally, we could get a wheel every week. I wrote the notes down here. We just immolated it with brass, some oboe, Yeah. There's a part in that song, a ballet, Through Mud, the title track, which I actually love that the instruments imitated what the voices was doing. Since the voices was only doing single vowels, it actually sounds better on the instrument. Interesting. Which It leads me to something else in the future. Like, okay, if I'm going to use a single file, I might as well use an instrument.

[02:16:38.830] - Speaker 2
Did you make any changes once you heard the orchestra playing it in rehearsal, where you had only heard it before on the piano, did you make any changes based on where the instruments overlapped?

[02:16:51.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah, there was many changes that had to be made, whether I wanted to or not. I see. Because the digital, if you're using Dorico Logic, Pro tools, Ableton, which all played, they all popped up on this shit. Also, I have a keyboard called the Korg Oasis. Old keyboard, but really have nice orchestra sounds in it. And actually have orchestras, like maybe an ostentato might be there. So almost like I could take an ostentato You get synthesized. I got one button to get that. I could hit that with one button while my other hand is figuring out something else and then record that. You know what I mean? And then take that MIDI file and put it into Logic, maybe, right? And say, Okay, how would that sound with this? And then maybe pull in spitfire audio and use one of their patches, and they got some motherfucking patches. Now it's like, it sound close to something real. Yeah. But now I give it to the orchestra. It's like, no, it doesn't make sense because the flatundo won't be there or the retard won't be here or the human is not going to do it that way.

[02:18:14.910] - Speaker 1
You're sitting there holding a note on a flute.

[02:18:22.980] - Speaker 2
Flute player only has so much air.

[02:18:24.590] - Speaker 1
Exactly. He's out of that. Right. Okay. So what do you want us to do? Do you want us to Devisi. Devisi meaning I'm dividing the note between two people.

[02:18:35.630] - Speaker 2
I see. Yeah.

[02:18:37.260] - Speaker 1
So now divisi is-So one starts it and the other one takes over.

[02:18:41.100] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And the first one comes back. Exactly.

[02:18:43.310] - Speaker 1
Divisi. So That has to be written on that chart. That means now the copiest got to know that. Then I had a great team. Scott O'Neill, of course, Mitch, and Tan, who was actually on my staff for the TV show. That was another good thing. I had all these musicians available for me when I was doing the TV show that I was able to... I just had them on salary.

[02:19:14.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's great.

[02:19:14.980] - Speaker 1
And I got some advice recently from Alexis French. He's a pretty established composer, pianist, great virtuoso. And I was like, How do I become virtuoso? He said, You should study the Goldberg Variations of Bach. I said, Oh, much, I'm going to. I haven't did it yet, but I'm going to do that. Because he just told me that shit in August.

[02:19:39.060] - Speaker 2
There's a lot of great versions of it, too, to listen to. It's inspiring to listen to.

[02:19:43.380] - Speaker 1
I don't read music fast. I can't put the music in front of me and bada, bada, bada, bada, bada. I read maybe a sixth grader by now, but it's still... So maybe at 60 BPMs, I could read it. At 90, No, that's not happening. I could go, Do, re, me, re, me, re, fa, fa, so, la, ti, ti. I could do that. Now, once I hear it now, oh, that's what he's doing. So now I got to see that, oh, it's mostly a Caesar's doing that. And then I could go ahead and try. But that's been my biggest weakness is imitation. That's my biggest weakness. And it's the weirdest thing about me. Besides recently, like I said, once he told me this Goldberg thing, and I did listen to a couple of them as well, and I've been listening to a few other greats, I actually realized I wouldn't mind imitating him. I'm a non-imitating dude. That's been one of my potential flaws as well as blessing. But I'd rather do what I'm doing than do what you're doing. You know what I mean? I got the guitar I started late. My vagina was like, what are you going to...

[02:21:03.590] - Speaker 1
Vajana is like, What do you going to... You're starting the guitar at this age. But I was like, You know what? I'll just do it.

[02:21:12.120] - Speaker 2
Just pick up the instrument and make sounds.

[02:21:14.250] - Speaker 1
Let me see See what I got? It might not be… It's the bass. It don't matter what it is, though.

[02:21:19.540] - Speaker 2
There's a guitar there, the third one, the furthest one. No, that one.

[02:21:26.080] - Speaker 1
It's just like, I'm still going to… Pam, I said, Fuck it.

[02:22:00.510] - Speaker 2
You don't need to be able to read music to do that. No. It's more like playing with the instrument, having fun.Beautiful. Yeah.

[02:22:26.100] - Speaker 1
Fuck it, you know what I mean? Yeah.

[02:22:27.660] - Speaker 2
So much fun to make music, isn't it? Yeah, it's like, let it out. It's great. Anyway. You mentioned the morning you pray. Tell me about your prayer life.

[02:22:35.550] - Speaker 1
I hold some of that personal, but I just say, pray, man. We grew up, people said, don't pray. I'll tell you one thing an old gentleman I mean, I think he was a Jewish brother. He actually have no hands. He works in the store, but he always helped me carry out the boxes. And I don't know, one day, as we were being friends, we started talking and talked about prayer. He said, What did you pray for? And I told him, I don't pray for nothing. I just give thanks. He was like, Oh, that's good. I pray for guidance. I was like, Okay, I'll take that.
