Speaker 1 (00:00:02):
Teragram. 
Speaker 2 (00:00:22):
So I went into the merch business, not to be in the merch business, but because if I am in the dressing room or my reps are in the dressing room all over the world, because merch, you could do the world. They didn't divide it up the way they did concerts. So I said, I need to go in the merch so that when some smart ass agent says to some manager, we're not going to use Cole, I'm going to count on them being good people and saying, no, no, no. Cole's our merchandiser. He was just in Melbourne with us. He was at London. You'll use coal and everything. Always went back to that core. I have to control the music in my territory. So now we have a merch company, we have the agency in 84. Michael Jackson has thriller and nothing's ever been that hot. I don't think Taylor Swift's as hot as he was then, relatively speaking, even the Beatles. They were hot, but oh my god, Michael Jackson. But I go to the bank and I borrow $3 million to get the merch rights to Michael Jackson and we're ecstatic, and I'm thinking it's going to get us the tour too. 
Speaker 1 (00:01:41):
Who's involved in that 
Speaker 2 (00:01:43):
Guy named Frank Dele and Norman Perry. Okay. And we do the deal for the merch. 
Speaker 1 (00:01:48):
Who on the Michael side? Frank Delio. 
Speaker 2 (00:01:50):
Frank was his manager. I see. Frank's gone and he was great. He was at CBS records and he looked after Michael's account and he managed it all. And so we do a deal and we do a deal for the retail merch. Now we're fine. We know there's going to be a tour. We're hoping to get the tour, but nothing's happening. Then there are these rumors that they're all locked up negotiating with somebody. Nobody knows who it is or what's happening. Then suddenly it's announced it's Don King. 
Speaker 1 (00:02:20):
Had Don King ever done music promotion 
Speaker 2 (00:02:22):
Before? No, no, no. He was a boxing 
Speaker 1 (00:02:23):
Promoter. Boxing promoter. Muhammad Ali's promoter. Yes, 
Speaker 2 (00:02:26):
Yes, yes, absolutely. And convicted of manslaughter. Did it like 10 years in jail? I dunno if you knew that part. We're a bit nervous though. We've got 3 million and it's Don King. I'm sitting there with Norman going, this isn't the best news. This is the next level for our company. We're going to go, holy shit. Michael Jackson. Bill Graham has everything under the sun at that point and he's the king. He's got the number one merch company. We were number two. But the truth is those numbers are misleading because we should have been number eight. There was nobody big enough to be number seven. Bill Graham controlled so much, but then there's a whole scurry of Don King and there's really a backlash and they need to kind of move Dawn aside. Now there's a rumor. Nobody knows who they're negotiating with. Nobody. I just assume it's Bill Graham because if it's nobody I can't hear. Lo and behold, they do a deal with a guy named Chuck Sullivan and Chuck's claim to fame was that his family owned the New England Patriots. I think we'll be okay. 
Speaker 2 (00:03:34):
Boom. The tour starts. It's unbelievable. It's wacky because Chuck has decided they're going to do three shows a week. Only Friday, Saturday, Sunday, which is nice. I always wanted that. Everybody wanted it. Chuck got it. I'm jealous. Michael agreed to it. Good for you. So we're feeling okay, we're good. And then it's 3, 2, 3 weeks into the tour and Norman calls me and says, there's a real buzz out here that the tour's in trouble. And I'm going, that's ridiculous. They're selling out. They're doing three shows in every city. No one's ever done. Even the Stones we're doing one the odd place. Two, he calls back a week later, he says, it's true. Everybody knows Chuck's in trouble. They raped him on the deal, and this is a great lesson in life, creativity, whatever. Don't do too good of a deal if both sides can't survive. And I go, hold on. What's going to happen? They say the tour's going to go down. Frank de Leo had to call me and say, as part of this deal, this is how I found out that they were doing the deal with Chuck Sullivan. I have a bid for the retail rights, which you owe. 
Speaker 2 (00:04:48):
And I said, but I have to match it. Right? And he said, yeah. I said, don't tell me what it's, let me go home and figure it out. I don't want to be enticed by your number. I can talk myself into anything. Some days I come back in the morning, I said, my people, we talked, my people have said 2 million. It's worth 2 million. I'll give you three. He said, we got 25. I said, it's yours. You owe me one. No problem. Waived it. And he did the deal with Chuck. So it turns out that Chuck has done, he got the tour, but he's done a terrible deal with Michael and the tour over paying to the point of where he can't put on the show he cannot and not knowing what he's doing and gutting in with a lot of sharks. The promoter had two trucks. 
Speaker 2 (00:05:35):
Do you know anything about touring? The promoters don't need trucks. Right, exactly. I've never had a truck. The promoter had two trucks. The first day I took over the tour, I fired 103 people, but he was going broke. Poor Chuck, who cares? Michael's not going to give me back the 3 million. He's not going to give us back the 3 million if the tour goes down. So I didn't know what to do, so I needed inspiration again. It always came when necessary. I thought about it and I thought about what am I going to do? My inspiration was to look on the calendar. I found out October 5, 6, 7, they weren't booked yet. He was waiting until the last minute to book everything. I said, I see that you're not booked on October 5, 6, 7. You need to let me take over the tour. I will save you. I will save the tour, but more importantly, I will save me. 
Speaker 2 (00:06:34):
And he says, we're not in trouble and I don't need your help. I had found out what his deal was, Michael. So I said to him, even though it's Yom Kipper weekend and my parents are going to cuss me out, I will work it out. And I worked it out. I had to go find out what time was sunset. I started the show at nine, so the rabbi wouldn't scream at me. He came into my office screaming at me. What are you doing? You're doing Michael Jackson on Yum. Kipper on Cole Nidre. You can't have Michael Jackson on Col Nidre. You can't have Michael Jackson. I went, first of all, we're not playing on Cole Nidre, and I made the next one after Sundown. So yum. Kipper is over. And so I go to Chuck and I said, here's the deal. I will pay you what you need to pay Michael. 
Speaker 2 (00:07:25):
It'll be the first show you break even and I'll give you a hundred thousand and then we'll stay up all night and we'll negotiate a deal for me to take over the tour and save you. That was one of my most inspired business thoughts. And I got Michael Jackson in Toronto for three shows. We sold out. Everything was great. I walked into the settlement, like I'd said to Chuck, I went, here's the check for Michael. Here's the check for a hundred thousand. And you did really well for a one third partner. And he looked at me and he went, you made 200. I said, I made 200. And the difference is you should run football games and I should run your tour. We stayed up all night and I took over the tour. Now that was just North American and it was the only tour that we only went after North America. 
Speaker 2 (00:08:16):
How many shows did you do? It was 52 shows of which I think there were 13 deep when we took over, right? The first one we took over was in Houston at the Astro Dome, and I went down with Billy Ballard, Harold's son, who was my best buddy and partner at the time on behalf of Maple Leaf Gardens. And I'm down backstage and somebody comes and says, Mr. King and Joe Jackson would like to see you up in this box. I go, no problem. I go upstairs and there's just the four of us and Don King looks at me. He's a big, have you ever met him? 
Speaker 1 (00:08:58):
I've seen him once in person. I've 
Speaker 2 (00:08:59):
Never met him. He's a big mother and he had hair though another foot high. I dunno if he still does at least a foot high. And he says, how are you doing? This is great. Good to have you bored. I know Chuck needed help, but I do want to say one thing to you. Are you sure you want to do this? There's a lot of boys have come down. A lot of white boys have come down from up north in Canada, down here to the south in Texas, and their mom has never saw them again. I look over to Billy Baller is like, you don't really want to take over this tour, do you? And again, I'm trying to figure out, fuck, is he threatening to kill me? 
Speaker 2 (00:09:42):
I'm trying to save the, what the heck? I said, Billy, go down have something to eat, please. I go in the hall. I said, he said, we're going back to Toronto. I said, we're not going back to Toronto because if we go back to Toronto, we're always only just in Toronto and that's not who we're going to be. We're not going to be told that we can't come to the United States or we can't just go downstairs. I got this and I walked back in and I went, look, this is about your tickets, right? And he goes, yes. I said, I'm not here to interfere with whatever you're doing with your 200 tickets to show. I don't care. I know, and I don't want to know exactly what you're doing, but I know what you're doing. It's like Bill Maher, we don't know, but we know. And I said, you got it. Two things are going to happen here. One, your tickets are totally protected, and two, you're going to see that we know what we're doing. And at the end of this time, Mr. King, when we're finished this, you're going to let us promote all of your closed circuit fights in Canada. I'll be happy just with Canada. Amazing. Which did happen. That's 
Speaker 1 (00:10:46):
Amazing. 
Speaker 2 (00:10:47):
But we did the Michael Jackson tour. 
Speaker 1 (00:10:49):
So you completely turned Don King around also from wanting to take you out to becoming 
Speaker 2 (00:10:55):
A Yeah. But it was the worst tour. I like to work. I still like to work. I just like what I do. And by the end of the tour, I took the whole family, her parents, her mother, my father, my mother, everybody, our kids. We had like four kids in five years, and I was so bummed that we all went to Hawaii for three and a half weeks. I'd never taken a week off. It was just such a depressing tour because Michael, in my opinion, made a flawed, flawed, flawed announcement the week the tour was starting that he was leaving the group and it was his last gig with him. So now the brothers are so what do we do? Just 
Speaker 1 (00:11:41):
Tension the whole 
Speaker 2 (00:11:41):
Time. Yeah. It's just like, are we going to be nothing? Are we going to be something? Are we going to ever make money again, all legitimate thoughts that should have come the last week of the tour are not the first, and it was just an awful tour. At the end of that tour, I had this purple file where I put all of the p and ls because while it was a mess and I helped Chuck, Chuck taught me a lot on that tour. Without realizing it, he booked all of the stadiums through the NFL owners. So I took that purple file, I put it in my drawer and I kept it. And then how did the worldwide thing happen? It wasn't supposed to happen. 87, I did Pink Floyd. 
Speaker 1 (00:12:24):
Oh, tell me about 
Speaker 2 (00:12:24):
That. Okay, what happened? 
Speaker 1 (00:12:26):
How did you end up with Pink Floyd 
Speaker 2 (00:12:28):
Again? It wasn't supposed to happen because ITG represented Pink Floyd. Roger leaves 78, 79, and there's a huge fight and there's a lawsuit and an unbelievable, well, Roger 
Speaker 1 (00:12:42):
Leaves Pink Floyd. He believes Pink Floyd's done. That's right. He's thinking, I'm the leader of Pink Floyd. I leave the band that stops and now I'll just be Roger Waters. Is that 
Speaker 2 (00:12:52):
Correct? That's right. That's right. He also thinks he owns it. Him and his manager say that he's Pink Floyd. Many people will say he's the most influential member. You, by the way, having worked with all these people all these years, and you've probably know this your own way, I don't think there really is such a thing. It's kind of like there's a story about comfortably numb and it's the last night and they're mixing, and Ezrin says there's something missing and Gilmore goes home and comes back with the guitar solo. Who cares? Who wrote it without that guitar solo that isn't voted by Rolling Stone as the greatest guitar solo in history and not the song that we have to close with with the Globe Ball. You know what I mean? It's a moment in time. They all contributed. I don't know why they can't be satisfied. 
Speaker 2 (00:13:46):
Maybe it's the nature of the beast. But anyway, so we're back to, I get a phone call. We got to always remember the circle. We got ITG, which is the agency that represents Pink Floyd. We got B Brocom, which is the merchandise company that represents Pink Floyd. We got CPI, which is the promoting company that promotes Pink Floyd in Canada, and it's all in a big circle. And Roger leaves and now it's 87. And all of a sudden I get a phone call from Steve O'Rourke, may he rest in peace and says The tour's off. And I go, holy shit. What happened? Premier Talent have written a letter to all the promoters saying that if you work with the new fake Pink Floyd, you can 
Speaker 1 (00:14:38):
Meaning Pink Floyd without Roger Waters the same Pink Floyd, 
Speaker 2 (00:14:41):
But without Roger Waters the same Pink Floyd who's won the lawsuit to say, no, you aren't Pink Floyd. And no, you don't own it. But if you work with Floyd, you can't ever have Roger Waters dates and you can't have any premier talent. And every single promoter sided with premier talent. It's 
Speaker 1 (00:15:01):
Like a blacklist, what you're 
Speaker 2 (00:15:03):
Describing. Absolutely. 
Speaker 1 (00:15:04):
Blacklist. 
Speaker 2 (00:15:04):
Absolutely. It's like the mob again. Right? And they all choked. So now they're calling Mike Farrell and Wayne Forte, and Steve O'Rourke and I are on the phone and it's hard to believe, but believe it or not, and I know exactly where the inspiration comes from because now I'm a fan. I'm depressed. I'm going, no, this can't be there. Can't not be a Pink Floyd. Do you guys realize? Of course they did, but I'm just spewing. Do you realize that if we give into this, there's no Pink Floyd anymore? And they go, yeah, there's no Pink Floyd, we're dead. I said, we're not dead. I'm doing the tour. I'm breaking the rule. Mike and Wayne, you can have your commission. I'll hire you to book the halls and everything. We're doing the tour. Oh, great. Let's think about it. What should we do? I said, yeah. Now that was a big statement. 
Speaker 1 (00:15:58):
You'd never thought about doing anything like this before. Correct. 
Speaker 2 (00:16:01):
I was perfectly happy. Yeah, 
Speaker 1 (00:16:03):
This is great. You're solving a particular problem. That's right. 
Speaker 2 (00:16:07):
That's exactly what it is. And it's a big danger too. 
Speaker 1 (00:16:12):
Absolutely. 
Speaker 2 (00:16:13):
So I take 15 minutes and say, what did I say and what does it mean? I call them back. I said, everybody on the phone, I said, don't interrupt me. And when I tell you this and you tell me I'm insane, you need to think about it. Right? And I said, what? I said, we're not moving to arenas like you want us to. We're playing stadiums. I said, we're playing stadiums because we have to stand up. It's Pink Floyd, for fuck's sake. It's Rolls Royce, it's Cadillac. The equity and the brand is what this is about. The fans don't care. This is how it'll work. They tell me I'm absolutely out of my mind. We scream and yell at each other for 20 minutes and O'Rourke gives in. 
Speaker 1 (00:16:57):
It's also, if you think about it, pink Floyd was not Elvis. It wasn't about the face. Pink Floyd was about the show and The Spectacular Light show and the psychedelic music and the experience. No 
Speaker 2 (00:17:13):
Question. But when I called back, I did say things like, you've done some homework on this that you've thought about it. And they said, yes. They said, well, how many songs does Rogers sing? Lead on it. How many does David and sing? And they said, well, we know this from prior publicity. 62% of all the singing is David. So I said, well, what are we worried about? Well just use songs with David's lead vocals. Nobody's going to care. Stop it. 
Speaker 1 (00:17:41):
Be they'll be happy to go to a Pink Floyd concert. 
Speaker 2 (00:17:43):
And we've had some amazing moments together. We had a show in Hamilton. Do you know where Hamilton is? Idea? 35 miles west of Toronto. Because none of the halls in Toronto would take the show. We're not having Pink Floyd rock and roll disease. Screw you. We had to go to court because once they found out it was Pink Floyd, I didn't tell them they wanted to cancel it. But our lawyers were really good and we won the case 
Speaker 1 (00:18:11):
In general. Was rock and roll frowned upon a candidate 
Speaker 2 (00:18:14):
At this time? It was tough. Listen, in 70, whenever it was, Keith got convicted. I was his bail bondsman, as they say, he got convicted in Toronto and that punishment because very wise judge, rather than put him in jail, he said, we're not going to put Keith Richards in jail. You have to do two concerts for a charity. I couldn't find a charity to accept it then. I couldn't find a hall. But let's go back to Pink Floyd if I get too distracted. Amazing. Unbelievable. Nobody would take the Rolling Stones. Yeah. So anyways, we got Hamilton. We do the show. Phenomenal. 55,000. I love it. One of my favorite groups, especially because they did something, nobody ever did the first half of the concert before the intermission. No opener ever is. We've been recording some new songs along the way. We've been in the studio and we'd like to play our next album for you. 
Speaker 2 (00:19:11):
And they played animals. Wow. Like an hour and five minutes, however long that album is. The whole album. But nobody does that. 55,000 people have never heard of Tune. It really helps if they, as Harry Belafonte used to say, get them to sing their song before you walk in. But anyways, they play it. It's the end of the tour. O'Rourke says to me, halfway through the show, what are we going to do? We got to do something to the band on stage during the last song, because it's the end of the tour, and we hook up all of the hoses with whipped cream and shaving cream. And during the song, we're dowsing the whole band. Arthur, who subsequently goes on to win Academy Awards for special effects. But we hear him say, oh, you think that's something? Well, you see what I can do. It finishes. We're going to have a huge barbecue with ribs and the greatest food. I go down underneath to sit and do the settlement. The cops are there with their guns. The cash is there and there's this explosion. My first thought is it's the neighbors trying to kill us. We had the concert that they didn't want. It. Turns out Arthur took all of the explosive for the concert that hadn't been used, went up to the top of the steps and blew up the scoreboard. 
Speaker 1 (00:20:30):
Wow. 
Speaker 2 (00:20:32):
I know. I run out. The cop says, nobody move. I was like, oh my God, what are we doing here? Unbelievable. So now we go to 87 and I'm going, this can't stop. This cannot stop. So they agree to do it. Then we have the next issue. This was also a fairly inspirational point. I say to Steve, I don't know how to put this to you, but we have to announce this tour and go on sale before you release the album. And I said, and you have to tell the band. I'm not telling the band. I'm their promoter. You're the manager. It's your job to do that. No, you are going to do that. Why did 
Speaker 1 (00:21:13):
You want to do 
Speaker 2 (00:21:14):
That? Because it didn't matter what the album was. People are going to criticize it because critics think they should criticize. Oh, there's no good without Roger Waters. Oh, pink Floyd. Oh, Roger Waters. I think the album was great, actually. The truth is sidebar, we had the most successful tour. Pink Floyd ever had more people, more tickets, better fans, and they created a better show than they'd ever had. But anyways, he finally agrees. Yeah, okay, I'll tell the band. Nobody in America knows the candidate exists yet. We'll announce Toronto, pink Floyd 
Speaker 1 (00:21:52):
One show. 
Speaker 2 (00:21:53):
We'll put one show on sale if it doesn't work. My ex exact quote was, David, it'll get sick and there'll be no Pink Floyd and we'll have a funeral for them. And they agree. Now it's the week we're going on sale. This may be my favorite part of the story. It's Monday. I announced the show. There's quite a buzz. I reach out for O'Rourke. No answer. I reach out for Gilmore. No answer. I call Ferrell and Forte, and they say, yeah, we can't reach them either. Now it occurs to me, let's stop being so defensive. What if it's good news? I call Tuesday to say, Hey, can I announce a second show? We've only ever booked one show. We have nothing. We don't really even have a show or a production of trucks. 
Speaker 1 (00:22:47):
And there's a chance that Pink Floyd without Roger Waters doesn't belong in the stadium. 
Speaker 2 (00:22:52):
Yes. Although 
Speaker 1 (00:22:53):
We don't know that until this moment. 
Speaker 2 (00:22:55):
We know it, but we don't know it. And Tuesday, no answer. Wednesday, no answer. Thursday, there's big lineups. We're not into Ticket Master time. There's big lineups at the outlets, and it's like, you can feel it. You can taste it. I'm going, I got to get ahold of them. I don't want to put a second social show on sale without their permission. I can't get an answer. So it's Friday morning, first show sells out quickly. I announce a second show. I'm calling. I'm getting no answers. I'm leaving Messages on the machine, though first show sold out. I'm announcing a second show. I'm going on sale now. An hour later, I call Second show sold out. I wish the hell somebody would call me. I've announced the third show going on sale half an hour later. We've sold 35,000 out of 55,000 for this third show. I wish somebody would call. I don't know if they're dead or what's happening. My secretary walks in and says, David Gilmore's on the phone. And I said, it's just some yank Wonker looking for tickets. Tell him to fuck off. She walks back in and says, David Gilmore will not hang up. I said, tell the guy to go away. I've been trying to reach David. The third time she comes in and says he won't hang up. I realized, oh, you know how you have that 
Speaker 1 (00:24:18):
Oh, oh, oh. It might actually be David Gilmore. No, 
Speaker 2 (00:24:21):
It is David. I go, hello. And he says, you couldn't sell 'em out faster. And I go, thank you. Where have you been? And he says, we got freaked out on Monday, realizing that if it didn't work, it was the end of Pink Floyd. And we went up to my cabin and we've been taking LSD all week. 
Speaker 1 (00:24:44):
Amazing. So had you not had that, 
Speaker 2 (00:24:48):
It was over. 
Speaker 1 (00:24:50):
Unbelievable. Yeah. 
Speaker 2 (00:24:51):
Yeah. I agree. 
Speaker 1 (00:24:52):
And then how did the tour go? So it ended up being your first tour. Promoting this tour was 
Speaker 2 (00:24:57):
So 
Speaker 1 (00:24:58):
Good. The whole country, 
Speaker 2 (00:24:59):
People think of Steel Wheels as the barometer of new tours, and it did 3 million, 700,000 people. And was that tour did like 3 million? Six P 
Speaker 1 (00:25:11):
Floyd was How many years 
Speaker 2 (00:25:12):
Before that was it? Well, one was 87 and one was 89. Yeah. But people, they always, it's hard. They flew under the radar, and yet the universe knew. But the media didn't. 
Speaker 1 (00:25:25):
It's funny because everything we're talking about is counterculture, but Pink Floyd is more counterculture than the Rolling Stones. Yes, I 
Speaker 2 (00:25:31):
Agree. 
Speaker 1 (00:25:32):
It's more of a Muso band. 
Speaker 2 (00:25:34):
It's a Muso band, but it's also a tough guy, man. The worst crowds, more bikers, more violence. Floyd, there were some tough nights. I 
Speaker 1 (00:25:43):
Didn't know that. Yeah, 
Speaker 2 (00:25:44):
That's really interesting. No, people 
Speaker 1 (00:25:44):
Don't know. Tell me about Bill Graham. When were you first aware of him? 
Speaker 2 (00:25:50):
1974, he did the Crosby Stills National Young Tour. Again, I was ascending. And he called Maple Leaf Gardens who said, call Cole. And he called me. So that's how we met. And we did Crosby Stills, national Young at the Varsity Stadium. And in those days, you didn't really know to hire people. So I did everything, bought the groceries, helped with the load in. Nobody knew how to make a capacity. So we figured it out and we went 40,000. So we sold 40,000 tickets. Just nothing but every song, heaven. In fact, it was the night before the show, everything finished at about nine o'clock, blazing Saddles was playing at the Varsity Theater across the street. I went to see it and fell asleep, and the next day, the stadium's full, and they're still lined up around the block. And I go, oh my God. What have you done, Michael? 
Speaker 2 (00:26:49):
Somehow we got them all in. Unbelievable. But that's the first night I met Bill Graham. Yeah. And what was your thought? He was my hero. Yeah. He was doing the Crosby Stills National Young Tour. He'd done all these other tours. It was like, holy shit, I want to be that guy. So we get to 89, 88, and he's doing the Amnesty Show. I've got the three o'clock call from Bob Mitchell who says, there's this lunatic. Not everybody's aware of everything. So Bob kind of knows who Bill Graham is, but not the way we would. Oh, bill Graham. Oh, this guy's, bill Graham's show. Roadies are roadies. Bob's a roadie, a great one. But it's like, look it, I quit. I said, you can't quit. This is a charity show. We're raising money. We're doing our bit. What are you doing? He said, there's this guy spewing at me. 
Speaker 2 (00:27:39):
I'm worse than puke. And they're like, I went, oh, is it Bill Graham? And he says, yeah. I said, just don't quit. I'm in my car. I go down there and I say to Bill, look at enough. Don't ever talk to any of my people ever again. I didn't really mean it. I didn't think I meant it. I said, but for the rest of today, just talk to me. Anything you need, we'll get through this. And when we're finished, we're never going to work together again. We do enough stuff with the United Appeal in the various charities. We do tons of stuff, raise millions. Even in those days, we're comfortable in our skin. We don't need this crap from you. We agree. We're working through it. So now it's the next morning, and this is how the Stones comes about. And again, this one, I don't know where it came from, and I wasn't trying to figure anything out at all. 
Speaker 2 (00:28:34):
Lo and behold, my staff all come into the office led by Bob Mitchell, who's been anointed and said, boss, we got to talk to you. I go, what is it? And he says, we know you promised us that we would never work with Bill Graham again, and we appreciate that. And I stopped them. I said, just stop. I know what you're going to say. I don't keep my word. I'm all about the money. And I said, just stop. I meant it. We need, the next thing in our growth is we need total self-respect and belief, and we need to demand it of everybody else. Now go back to your desks and do your job. And I did mean it when it came out, and I ultimately did mean it the rest of my life. And they say to me, but you can't mean it. And I go, why? And they said, because if we don't work with Bill Graham, we'll never get to work with the Rolling Stones. He was their promoter. And I said, well, this is six years since he did the one tour. See, some people are bigger than life. He only ever did one tour, and it had been six years. Yes, but it was still him 
Speaker 1 (00:29:44):
At this moment in time that we're talking about, what are the stones up to? 
Speaker 2 (00:29:50):
They don't exist. 
Speaker 1 (00:29:52):
The stones don't exist. No. 
Speaker 2 (00:29:53):
They've been pissing all over each other in the press for seven and a half, eight years. 
Speaker 1 (00:29:58):
So they haven't done anything in, Mick has 
Speaker 2 (00:29:59):
Dissolved the corporation. Wow. 
Speaker 1 (00:30:02):
Which 
Speaker 2 (00:30:02):
Is 
Speaker 1 (00:30:02):
The Stones are now the 
Speaker 2 (00:30:03):
Final decree. 
Speaker 1 (00:30:04):
So for seven-ish years, they don't exist. They don't exist. 
Speaker 2 (00:30:08):
That's right. I am going to put them together because we need self-respect, and we need to prove that we can do it and screw that. Because we don't want to be abused by Bill Graham. We're never going to work with the Rolling Stones wrong. We're going to work with the Rolling Stones. 
Speaker 1 (00:30:24):
Then 
Speaker 2 (00:30:24):
We're going to let that ultimate lesson of self-respect and moving forward and discipline all work. 
Speaker 1 (00:30:32):
What happened next? 
Speaker 2 (00:30:33):
So what next is in less than an hour, I call O'Rourke. I said, well, I figured out I'm going to put the stones back together. I'm going to give him 40 million. He interrupts and says, it won't happen. There's no chance they're pissing on each other. It'll never happen. I said, I'm going to give them 40 million for 40 shows 
Speaker 1 (00:30:58):
Just to understand the marketplace. How much more is that than anyone had ever gotten for anything? 
Speaker 2 (00:31:04):
Two or three times. 
Speaker 1 (00:31:06):
Yeah. Two or three times. The biggest store in history. And you have never done anything on that scale? 
Speaker 2 (00:31:12):
Well, didn't do for myself, but I did for Chuck Sullivan, Michael Jackson, and I saw how much Michael Jackson made, and it was more than that. I see. But here's the thing about the Chuck Sullivan thing. There's the industry and there's the people outside. Chuck was an outsider, and I went to the outsiders to do that tour. Nobody in the industry knew exactly what was going on or what happened 
Speaker 1 (00:31:35):
If you did it the normal way. You couldn't have done it. 
Speaker 2 (00:31:38):
No, no. Couldn't have done it. And he says, okay, but now I'm not going to call Rupert. I go, why? He says, because you're going to go bankrupt and you're my friend, and we love you. We're Pig Floyd. We can't do that. I said, you're wrong. 
Speaker 1 (00:31:52):
Is this another case where you don't have the 40 million, by the 
Speaker 2 (00:31:54):
Way? I don't have a nickel. No, I do not have the 40 million. 
Speaker 1 (00:31:58):
Okay. Just had to ask. Absolutely. Just want to make sure it's a given. Okay. I want to make sure I understand 
Speaker 2 (00:32:02):
The story, but I am with Labatts. It's a long story. I was with Molsons and I was with the gardens. They screwed me at the closing. They screwed me. Then I said to them, you screwed me, Mr. Molsons, and I will be back to you in the next two years. Within a year, I sold my company 50% to Labatts. And the family that owned it was Charles Bronfman, the Bronfmans, the infamous. Okay. So now I've done a deal where they own half my company, and I'm thinking, Charles will give me the money. I don't even ask how the money works. I'm so relieved. You're 
Speaker 1 (00:32:44):
Already the most successful promoter in Canada at this time. 
Speaker 2 (00:32:49):
For years. Yes. But I always bid off this much and generated this much. It was a successful company. 
Speaker 1 (00:32:55):
You've been, just so I understand, you've been wildly successful now for about 17 years, if I do the math right? 
Speaker 2 (00:33:02):
Well, 74, we got successful. So this is 13 years. 
Speaker 1 (00:33:05):
Okay, so 13 years of great success. You're offering $40 million for something and you have nothing. We're 
Speaker 2 (00:33:11):
Just, yeah, we're living beyond our means. 
Speaker 1 (00:33:13):
Yes. Okay. I just want to understand the picture clearly. You nailed it. 
Speaker 2 (00:33:19):
I understand that. And I don't have the 40, but I offer it. Yes. And you want to know how impactful 40 million was? Yes. There's better ways than saying more than anybody. Rupert said. Steve O'Rourke called me and said, you have an interesting offer to make. And I said, didn't he tell you what it is? And he said, yes, but I need to hear it from your mouth. And I go, 40 million for 40 shows. And he says, I'd like to meet you halfway. And he laughs. I said, okay. He says, I'll take the Concord to New York tomorrow. You fly in and meet me for lunch. Is that okay? And I said, fine. So he's not waiting. This is late in the day, and he's getting on the morning Concord. 
Speaker 1 (00:33:59):
Yeah. Unbelievable. 
Speaker 2 (00:34:01):
By the end of the lunch, he says, you've got my vote. And you've got the tour, but you have to get Mick and Keith. Very significant statement. I've worked with the Stones. Yes. I've been a local promoter in Canada, and I was their local promoter in Buffalo, but I don't understand where Rupert fits because he is never showed up at a single show. But now I'm having lunch with him and he says, you've got the stones. I go back, I say to Lori, I had this really weird lunch with this guy who for some reason thought it was appropriate to blow smoke up my ass and tell me I have the stones, which couldn't possibly be happening. We just met. I still think he's blowing smoke up my ass. So we have dinner. Then I come home at the dinner. He says, well, we got to figure out what to do with Mick and Keith. 
Speaker 2 (00:34:49):
You have to meet with them. They have to like you. They have to trust you. Mixed in love with Bill Graham due to we part, and we figure out, we'll talk again in a few days. I start to do a little homework and some people tell me, yeah, Rupert hates Bill Graham. Bill Graham calls him Fatty. He was a short, really rotund Brit who Bill Graham was too arrogant to and didn't respect him. And so I go, okay, there's hope. And we're talking and talking, and then suddenly we've looked at a budget we've looked at, and it's kind of like, wow, I'm actually maybe going to get this. So now we're making the deal and we have to have a meeting with the Rolling Stones. I've met them. I've worked with them, but I'm coming in as a different, you know what I mean? Yes. I'm everybody's buddy. Now I'm coming in trying to marry your daughter. Yeah. I never noticed that Scar in your face. Yeah. Step two, how do we get them 
Speaker 1 (00:35:51):
To talk to each other 
Speaker 2 (00:35:53):
So we can coc the thing, me and Rupert, 
Speaker 1 (00:35:57):
The goal is to get Mick and Keith to talk. 
Speaker 2 (00:35:59):
Yes. Okay. But we do it without getting them to talk. We go to Jan Winter and Rolling Stone Magazine and get them to induct them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. We know that a Keith lives in Connecticut. B, he'll go C, that you have to play after. We also know from chatting that all the rest of the band will show up and that if Mick doesn't, they don't care. They'll do it. 
Speaker 1 (00:36:29):
And Mick 
Speaker 2 (00:36:29):
Won't allow, allow that. Never allow that to happen. And you can't go. And Yawn and Mick are friends. So we know that when it's time for the Stones to play, there's no chance Mick won't play with them. It works. They get inducted, they play. And the next Monday, Rupert calls me and says they liked it. We're going to have a meeting with you. Come to New York a couple of weeks later and see if we can stand each other. Great plan worked. Now it's time to go to the meeting meeting's on a Monday. I go to New York on Thursday, I lock myself in a room at the park and Meridian and I just talked to a mirror with room service for four days answering every question that they're ever going to ask me. I'm going to be ready. It's all set. It's Monday morning, meetings at noon. 
Speaker 2 (00:37:24):
Nobody gets up before that. I've got my Def Leppard jacket, and I got my Pink Floyd jacket, and I don't know which one to wear. I'm very superstitious. And I go, I got to wear my Pink Floyd jacket. I walk in, it's done and over when I walk in, because I walk in with my Pink Floyd leather jacket, which is nicer and better than any merch that Stones had ever produced. And Mick stands up and looks at it, turns to the rest of the band, says, you see that jacket? That's what I've been talking about. And I knew we had to have a meeting and talk about it, but it was kind of like, wow. It wasn't over that I was going to get it, but it was over that I was in the running. 
Speaker 1 (00:38:09):
Well, it was also over that you had something that they wanted. Yes, just bump into it 
Speaker 2 (00:38:15):
In that moment. But everybody wanted it. Yeah. It was just, we were doing it for other bands and for whatever reason, went to Atlanta and Bill Graham weren't doing it for The Stones. They were still stuck in black tees. And we were trying to do other stuff because we started to realize who are the Stones audience to next? This is 
Speaker 1 (00:38:35):
Late eighties. So the original Stones fans were all grown up successful people now. 
Speaker 2 (00:38:41):
Exactly. So the next thing is we have the meeting, it goes really well. We keep going, and now we're down to the deal. And we've negotiated and negotiated and negotiated the deal. And 
Speaker 1 (00:38:56):
What are some of the points in the deal beyond, because the main event has already been covered. It's 40. 40. Well then 
Speaker 2 (00:39:03):
Expenses, and who pays the expenses and when there's overage. I see. So now it looks like it's real. I got to go back to Charles Bronwyn and get the money. We have a meeting. He said, glad you brought me a deal. This is why we did business with you. Then we go to the Labatts board and they start asking questions. Charles got really mad, slammed the table and says, what are you asking questions? It's the Rolling Stones. If you're not going to back the Rolling Stones, why are we in business with this lad? Like, stop it. And I went to them for 65 million, by the way. I said, I think we're going to get it for 40, but I'm telling you, we will get it for 65. Yeah. 
Speaker 2 (00:39:44):
So anyways, they approved the 65. I'm bidding 40. Time has moved on. It's late winter, February, March 89. We're doing the deal. I think I've got it. I don't know that they're still talking to Bill Graham. I don't know that Mick is still pushing for Bill Graham, but I hear a story of Bill Graham flying over with Mick on the Concord. He was having an affair with one of Mick's secretaries. And ultimately, I do hear from Mick later on that that was true, and that Mick in the end was going to give it to Bill, really? And just said, Michael's bids 10 million higher than yours. So I felt good that I knew they would only bid 30. Michael's bids 10 million higher than yours, and do you not think I'm responsible for protecting the band? And do you not think that 2 million each is a lot for us to pay to work with you? And Bill said, no. And Mick later told me that's when Bill lost was like, why would the Rolling Stones work for 10 million last week? Where are the Rolling Stones? Of course, in some ways, it's a funny world because in Bill Wyman's book later, he talks about how they had a big tiff with Bill over 3 million that he stiffed them for and refused to pay, and the band swore they'd never work with him again. So you have the other four Rolling Stones thinking The negotiation with me and Bill Graham is just a ruse to get me up as high as possible. There's no chance on Earth they're going to work with Bill and Mick's still cavorting with Bill. I go to Barbados for the closing bill's there. 
Speaker 1 (00:41:22):
What 
Speaker 2 (00:41:22):
Bill's there pitching? You 
Speaker 1 (00:41:24):
Didn't tell me that. 
Speaker 2 (00:41:25):
No, I'm telling you now. Unbelievable. I've gotten to the closing bill, making his pitch kind of thing. Unbelievable. I know. The reason I think we've got, it's because one night we're at home in Douglas Drive, and it's really late, and there was a band meeting. I knew it, and Rupert told me they were making a decision. They called us at about 1130 at night, and all the band were there. And Rupert with his fantastic Prince Rupert, oh, Michael, the Rolling Stones have decided to be employed by you for the purposes of touring. And the band are all here. Say, hi, boys. That's 
Speaker 1 (00:42:02):
So funny. 
Speaker 2 (00:42:03):
Well, I never forgot employed by you, and I went so employed by me. Yeah, exactly. Fantastic. Exactly. So now we're in Barbados and we're doing a closing. Yeah. 
Speaker 1 (00:42:14):
But why is Bill there? 
Speaker 2 (00:42:15):
Well, he was some last minute pitch to save the day, to save the, well, the first, sorry, I skipped the first Barbados. I got to go to Barbados when they're making steel wheels and hang around with them for a week. I go to the studio, they're recording. Everything's great. Things are happening. I'm worried about one thing, but I will save it for the rehearsals. I don't have the tour yet. Anyways, now it's okay. What do you guys do at night for Relaxation? And Mick says, we're going dancing. Be in the lobby at six 30. You, me and Keith, we're going to go dancing. I go, great. I think it's Jimmy Cliff has a club, and he's buddies with the stones. So we're going to go there. We're going to eat, have our own room, and we're going to be dancing. We're walking down the hallway, and I see this good looking blonde, and I go, oh, God, making Keith. I won't see them again. Tonight. We get up there, we're walking in the three of us, two security guards, and what's the first thing she says, Michael, I haven't seen you for so long. And it was a girl I knew from Ken, but it's kind of like later when Keith and I are sitting at the bar and mixed dancing with every good looking girl here. He says, how did you get that girl here so fast? He's like, but anyways, 
Speaker 1 (00:43:35):
That's really funny. 
Speaker 2 (00:43:36):
We have a good week. Everything goes great. We go back to New York, then we have to go back to Barbados later on for the closing. We do the closing. It's happening. Bill tried everything he can. Forbes magazines making an article about the Wonder Kids blowing his brains out again. He gave them $40 million. He's sunk his ship this time round. 
Speaker 1 (00:44:02):
One of the reasons I was excited to meet you was I remember a quote from Bill Graham. He didn't say this to me. This was a public quote. The stone said supposedly that if he would meet your offer, they would do it with him. Mick 
Speaker 2 (00:44:19):
Said that, 
Speaker 1 (00:44:20):
And he said, I can't do that. It's not about the money. It's about the money. And I thought that line, it's like there's so much in that sentence. 
Speaker 2 (00:44:35):
Yes, yes. 
Speaker 1 (00:44:36):
It 
Speaker 2 (00:44:36):
Sounds like Bill. 
Speaker 1 (00:44:37):
Yeah. And I'm picturing Bill Graham, the beatnik slash hippie entrepreneur of the people. And I'd never met you before today, and I assumed you were the suit from Canada 
Speaker 2 (00:44:52):
Who 
Speaker 1 (00:44:53):
Had more money to beat out Bill Graham. And I thought, that must be interesting. Just that. And then you turned up, 
Speaker 2 (00:44:59):
Yeah, here I am, and 
Speaker 1 (00:45:00):
It's a different story. But you 
Speaker 2 (00:45:01):
Know what? I'm not the suit from Canada, and he wasn't the hippie. Well, 
Speaker 1 (00:45:05):
When you walked in, I could see you weren't suit 
Speaker 2 (00:45:07):
From Canada, but he wasn't the hippie. Bill Graham was a businessman. Oh, for sure. And I don't want to talk Ill about the debt, as they say, but we were saddled with Bill Graham and his inadequate business thoughts for years. This is the thing about Bill. He thought it was okay to keep ticket prices low so that the scalpers would make more. And he was part of that thing with the scalpers. Oh, I didn't know I was able to change things. How did I change it? I think my biggest contribution, and a lot of promoters hated me. There was a huge promoter meeting, bill called one. He didn't invite me. I was meaningless. I wasn't meaningless, but I wasn't meaningful enough for Bill. But then there was another promoter meeting, which was like 98. Promoters voted me the devil, and the only one that didn't was my representative. I refused to go to the meeting. But the thing about Bill was he just was making too much money. And I changed that. And the promoters hated me in a way, because I just took everything. It's funny because I haven't thought about a lot of this stuff for so long. 
Speaker 1 (00:46:13):
Yeah. Why would you move on? But 
Speaker 2 (00:46:16):
It's just what it really is. So it's a fan. Yeah. Learning how to do business and Rupert was unbelievable. Unbelievable lesson because I mean, you do a deal with Rolling Stones. I'm just a promoter. I sign up. I'm used to my rule. It's about a week before the first show, and I'm calling Rupert and saying, when are you coming to Philadelphia? And he says, I'm not. I need to take a breath. I'm a promoter who works with the bands. But when the crisis comes, I go to the manager and now, what do you mean you're not coming? When are you coming? He says, well, I'm coming to New York. And I go, but that's five weeks into the tour. 
Speaker 1 (00:46:57):
If there's an emergency in those five weeks, who would you talk to? 
Speaker 2 (00:47:01):
Myself and the band. Now we're in the late eighties, 
Speaker 1 (00:47:03):
But let's walk through the numbers for, but you 
Speaker 2 (00:47:05):
Know how important 40 million was? My idea with the Stones was in 85 50. 
Speaker 1 (00:47:13):
Amazing. 
Speaker 2 (00:47:13):
That's how much 40 million we're never going to get into percentage. This guy's nuts. 
Speaker 1 (00:47:18):
Yes. Let's do the 90 10 for a minute. I 
Speaker 2 (00:47:21):
Didn't know by the way, that they had the fight with Bill Graham. That was something that Bill Wyman, who I became very friendly with as the tour started. 
Speaker 1 (00:47:29):
Why did he leave the band, do you know? 
Speaker 2 (00:47:31):
He hated flying. He hated flying. Understood. And so what happened was we went through, it's opening flight. We're going from rehearsals to fly to the first gig for the Stones. I'm with the band. I'm the tour director and the promoter, I'm the quasi manager. And we had almost all the same staff that there were on the previous tour where they were getting used to me. I was a bit edgy, like, oh God, they're all of Bill Graham. I have a different management style. He's involved in every nickel and dime. I drove them crazy at first. Some of them almost had nervous breakdowns. I would go like, why are you calling me if you're not the best? This is the Stones. We have the best truck drivers. We have the best caterers. We have the best everything. You must be able to make a decision. Call me when it's important. 
Speaker 2 (00:48:21):
But Bill was involved in everything. Understood. But now we're going to the first gig, and Alan Dunn has a big smile on his face and says, well, we've seated you up front with the band, and you have the seat opposite Bill Wyman. And he goes, I don't catch that. It's a trick. So we get to the first gig, we sit, we have our own plane. There's the table here. Bill sits down, lays out about six pills, puts it back. I go, what are you doing? He says, well, you know we're going to die, don't you? He infected me. I couldn't fly for like five years. I was a nervous wreck like him. Oh, there's a leak from the plane, from the engine. Go talk to the pilot. There's no leak. But he was a rolling stone. And I'll go, I mean, you have to maintain a protocol. 
Speaker 1 (00:49:06):
You caught his paranoia. I caught his flu. Wow. 
Speaker 2 (00:49:09):
So by the time we got to Europe, which was called Urban Jungle, because Steel Wheels was costing them too much money and they were losing money, I was okay. But we made a deal that made the 40 million work. Anyways, we scrapped Steel wheels and we created a new show that made everything work. But by then he'd given up, I can't Fly anymore. He took trains and it didn't work because sometimes the train was late and he missed soundcheck. There was friction with the band. Where's Bill? How can we have soundcheck without our bass player? What's wrong with him? And it was over. 
Speaker 1 (00:49:45):
Let's talk about before 90 10 economics, and then when you first learned about the 90 10. Give me an example using numbers. 
Speaker 2 (00:49:55):
Well, the difference was if the act would make 50,000 and the promoter would make 50,000, now the ACT's going to make 90,000 and the promoter's going to make 10. 
Speaker 1 (00:50:05):
Understood. And would those have been about the numbers? It would've been 
Speaker 2 (00:50:09):
Like, yeah, it's some nice in 
Speaker 1 (00:50:10):
That range. Yeah. 
Speaker 2 (00:50:12):
Okay. I mean, as it grew, 180,000 and 20,000. But that's why a promoter had to learn to go, we better go in the ticket business, or We better have travel packages, or We better get a ticket rebate or some scalped I didn't scalp. And we would do those things. 
Speaker 1 (00:50:31):
And then eventually, when you got to the point of the deal with the Stones, you were counting all of the, not just the tickets, but the T-shirts and the Everything. Everything. And it was all going into the pot. Yeah. 
Speaker 2 (00:50:44):
Well, I used to describe us internally 
Speaker 2 (00:50:48):
As an arena without Walls, because it's like the NFL. I'm sure they don't make money on the game. And eventually we've gone into everything by The Stones. I was doing other stuff. It had already done Wide World of Sports, professional Skating Tour. Again, just opportunities where I met some skaters and I met some people with the skating, and they were complaining that the Olympics was the worst thing ever, because when it was finished, they couldn't compete anymore. They worked, but they have to go to Ice Follies or Ice Capades, and it was so useless and boring. And I said, well, then let's start a tour. So we started the Professional Skating 
Speaker 1 (00:51:29):
Tour. Great idea. 
Speaker 2 (00:51:30):
And then Bob Iger, when he was a stoker, and I was Aker, we did a deal for whether it Steve Lieber and Bob Iger and myself did a deal to do the professional skating on a b, C wide world of sports in Madison Square 
Speaker 1 (00:51:45):
Garden. Great. Tell me the history of Live Nation. 
Speaker 2 (00:51:50):
It was Bob Silverman really started a thing called SFX. I had tried it my own way and kind of failed. At a certain point, I had 12 different promoters, and Bob was a more sophisticated businessman, and it gave him a huge, this is how you do it. I watched him do it and went, wow. But it really was called SFX. They just changed it to Live Nation. There was no Live Nation. It was SFX. It was Bob Silverman. 
Speaker 1 (00:52:20):
Was he a promoter 
Speaker 2 (00:52:21):
Before? No, he was an aggregator. I see. He's a New York Sharpie businessman. Aggregator. He had aggregated radio, and you might know a thing called A MFM Radio. And Bob and him were partners. I don't mean DJ like this. I mean, hey, good morning. This is Cousin Brucey. Oh, cousin Brucey. I knew if I did it. Cousin Brucey and Bob Silverman. He and Bob bought a radio station. Then they bought another station, then they bought another one. Then they bought so many, and they had a company called A MFM Radio, which had a zillion stations, and that was Bob. And then he dumped it and made a bazillion dollars. 
Speaker 1 (00:53:04):
And that became what's now iHeartRadio, I suppose. 
Speaker 2 (00:53:07):
That's right. Well, kind of, because what happened with A MFM is that Bob took that money and he started buying promoters. He had had an idea, now that I did the music, I'll aggregate the promoters. And so he gave this promoter 20,000,030, and everybody thought he was nuts. And some people fought it. My friend Arnie and his partner, they fought it. I think I was the last major to give in and getting nine figure numbers. Of course, he spent 1.3 billion and sold it for, it was either three or 4 billion. So last laugh, ha. Yeah, 
Speaker 1 (00:53:45):
And it's the whole idea of an aggregator that the more 
Speaker 2 (00:53:48):
Of the A MFM became Clear Channel. 
Speaker 1 (00:53:51):
Clear Channel, and then Clear Channel became iHeartRadio. That's what it is today. Same 
Speaker 2 (00:53:55):
Thing. And it bought SFX. Yeah. Live Nation just became later. They changed the name. There was no formation. 
Speaker 1 (00:54:04):
But the idea was Bob bought all the promoters or as many as he could. And the idea was instead of it being a local business, by scale, you could make better deals. Is that what it is? Yes. Yes. It's as simple as that. 
Speaker 2 (00:54:20):
It is that simple. Ultimately, live Nation, for example, there was a realization what we do as many people as Disney. Disney does 35 million a year. We do 35 million a year. Disney does a hundred million in sponsorship. We do two. We need to present ourselves better. 
Speaker 1 (00:54:44):
Tell me about, from your position, you see this guy buying up your equivalence in other parts of the country. When do you decide, I want to be part of this? Or what's the thinking? Is it I'm going to get swallowed up anyway? 
Speaker 2 (00:54:58):
No. Wasn't that at all? I was doing great. I mean, I was still independent. I had Stones, G two, Streisand, Crosby, stills, national Young. I was great. I didn't need them. But the offer got so big that I just went, okay, fine. This is stupid. That's 10 years money today. I can never catch up. Even at 4%. 
Speaker 1 (00:55:24):
Yes. 
Speaker 2 (00:55:25):
Yeah. So yes, let's do it. 
Speaker 1 (00:55:27):
And then you were involved from the beginning once it was put together? Yes. 
Speaker 2 (00:55:32):
No, it had been put together and a few years later I came on board. 
Speaker 1 (00:55:37):
I didn't know 
Speaker 2 (00:55:38):
That. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. 
Speaker 1 (00:55:41):
And what was the experience like? 
Speaker 2 (00:55:45):
I thought it was pretty good. I mean, I lived through it. We all exited kind of when they sold it, but I liked Bob. It was also, again, one of those things you reflect on life. I got up in the morning. I'm going to Bob's funeral. I'm getting up in the morning. Bob's died. He had throat cancer. I'm going to his funeral. I'm sad, but I'm feeling good. I went, I'm going to see all of those guys. I'm going to see Mitch. I'm going to see Larry. I'm going to see all of those guys. I go to the funeral. I'm the only guy that showed up. 
Speaker 1 (00:56:17):
Really. 
Speaker 2 (00:56:18):
I'm the only fricking guy that showed up, and it dawns on me. I'm going to say this, but all the Americans who ever listen are going to hate me, but so be it. All the Americans, I'm Canadian. And I go, it must be. They thought they were worth the money, and I didn't. Wow. Because I'm there thanking him, my buddy, and saying, holy Christ, you gave us money we never would've had. But I was so shocked, nobody, how do you know you might just be a better friend than they are? I don't know. One of the things when I came to this country that I had the hardest time getting used to is how aggressive everybody was. I mean, so aggressive. I know Canada's caught on now, but they were so aggressive, and maybe I'm still a bit of a high school kid. I'm still always shocked when what I thought was true is true. 
Speaker 2 (00:57:13):
And when I find out people are who I thought they were, I'm never one of these guys go, oh, I knew. But there's so many people who go, oh, I knew all of those other promoters were, oh, I knew. And I've always walked around going, didn't know. I dunno, where you're somewhere lost in your walking through life, but you didn't know. Now by the way, I'll give you my best. You knew story ever. The greatest thing about, I mean, we've skipped 20 years, but so be it. But touring with the Stones, I am in Barbados. We're closing the deal. So we're back to that. I'm leaving to go to Barbados and Lori says, I don't know how she could be this prescient, but women are like that. She says, great, go get the deal. But do not go on tour with them because it's 1989 and we have four children, six and under. 
Speaker 2 (00:58:12):
So I said, don't you worry I won't. Now I'm in Barbados next scene in the movie, I'm in the room. It's just the Rolling Stones. And me, not even Rupert, there's one last deal point. And Mick says, so we were in Australia and Bill Graham wasn't at the gig and there was a problem with the science and the guy from the sponsors and Paul Dainty, the promoter end up in the dressing room harassing me. And I didn't know what to do and I had to give him back some money. And it was a very unpleasant conversation, Michael. So the band, and I would like to say the following, we're going to be on all the tour and at all the shows, where are you going to be? I knew one thing from having been their local promoter, and I don't say this because some people would say, oh, that's just stubborn. They don't bluff. And I knew it. And so I hesitated for an Eon, which was probably three seconds. And I went, well, I'm going to be on all the shows. And they said, that's one of our demands. Yeah. What was the conversation when you got home? I didn't tell her. 
Speaker 2 (00:59:29):
I'm embarrassed with her sitting there. I didn't tell her until about four days until I left for rehearsals. Wow. Which was months later, I didn't have the balls. But now we're in Brixton Academy. But that's one of the things about with the Stones and being with these different groups is you get to be in these historical or interesting moments where you get to see the truth. I'm sitting at Briston Academy, Keith Richards is there. This is one of those great nights, one of the best half hours of my life, and also one of the most embarrassing. There's a coach for two and there's a chair. I'm on the left of the coach for two. And Keith's in the chair, we're just chatting our pregame chat, little small gig, 500 people. We did lots of those. They love them. They're the best gigs. This scrawny looking guy in a beige trench coat with a hat comes in and he looks like he's 105 pounds. 
Speaker 2 (01:00:34):
And he sits down and Keith says, hi, how you doing? They're chatting for about three minutes and Keith goes, oh, I'm embarrassed, Michael, I didn't introduce you. George Michael and I, look, I don't recognize him. And I say to Keith, that's not George Michael. He said, it's George Harrison. You idiot. I know. I know, I know. What can I tell you? Pretty funny. It is funny. And it happens. So we're chatting and then the guys come in and say, Keith, 15 minutes till you go on. So George says, this has been great. I'm going out to see the show. Oh, you here? I'm just here by myself. I just live over there. I came over, I couldn't, hadn't seen you for so long. And then George Harrison stands up and he looks at him. He says, I'm so jealous of you guys. Wow. But it gets better because Keith goes, what do you have to do to be jealous of us? 
Speaker 2 (01:01:38):
You are a Beatle. I mean, he acknowledges like, you are a Beatle. We're the Stones. And Harrison goes, yeah, but look at you guys. You're still together. You kept it together. We couldn't keep it together. It's been decades. And Keith goes, why didn't you keep it together? And he says, Paul had to control everything. And so you sit there and you go, holy shit. It's not going to the book, but maybe you can go on here. It's like, my God. Now the other good part of the story is George Leaves. I'm talking to Keith for about three seconds again, it seemed like a minute. And I realized, holy shit. He's got a trench coat on. He doesn't have a pass. He has a hat. Nobody's going to recognize him. Be right back. I run out to try and rescue him, and I see one of the security guys carrying him out. Oh my God. And I go put him down. And they go, what do you mean? I said, that's George Harrison. Put him down. Amazing. So it's like if you ever wrote a book, the chapter would be put him down. So funny. Unbelievable. Unbelievable 
Speaker 1 (01:02:49):
Stuff. I was going to say, tell me about Prague. 
Speaker 2 (01:02:52):
First of all, we all were learning to tour. Stones had done tours, but 74 days. But during steel wheels, we're all learning. Mick has rules. No children, no wives. Everybody goes on strike. I have to go tell Mick that everybody's on strike. He gives in. He was just trying to hide everything from Jerry, but we worked it all out. Now we're out on Voodoo Lodge and we've got our families, but now we're in Europe. Anyways, I get a phone call and it's from Hovel, and he says, hello, I'm Vle Havel's assistant. And he says, well, we need to have a concert, and it's important, and President Haveve has authorized me to speak to you and you to speak to the band. We'd like to have a concert in Prague. And I go, that's great. I haven't really followed what's going on at all. So I start to get defensive and I go, how do I know you're with the president? 
Speaker 2 (01:04:00):
How do I know you're not just some guy trying to come and get tickets? We're in Germany and get tickets for this German show? He says, I don't want to come to them. I said, well, you have to get me a note with the official seal. But then I go and do some research. I'm somewhat embarrassed that I don't know that he got a million people to sit in the city square and throw the Russians out without a bullet. He's now my new hero. Wow. He's replacing Pete Seeger, who was my previous hero, and now he's my hero. And he sends me the letter. I get it by delivery. There's no internet. And I look at it, it looks real. I don't really know if it's real. It could be a grand scheme, of course. But anyways, I go to Mick and Keith and I said, halve. 
Speaker 2 (01:04:44):
And they go, yeah, we know they want us to do a concert. Mick was always really good at this stuff. And I said, they don't have any money. We're going to lose money. We're not even going to break even. And the truth is, it's behind the Iron Curtain. What was the Iron Curtain? It's 1990, not because that's when the Berlin Wall came down. It all happened very quickly. Like we've never sold records there. People might've smuggled them in. Where do they want to play it? I said, well, they have this stadium. Sparta is the biggest stadium in the world that the Soviet Union, as it used to be called, it has six football fields where they would have the gymnastics championships for the whole Soviet Union. And it holds 250,000. 
Speaker 1 (01:05:35):
So typical stadium holds 
Speaker 2 (01:05:38):
60, 60, we're playing to 50 to 60,000. LA had a hundred. We did three nights. There was Beatles, there was Michael Jackson's, and then there was Steel Wheels. I mean, it was unbelievable. So now we have to have the discussion. What the fuck do we do? What do we do? I get maps of it. I think about it. I go back to Mick. They're convinced we're going to sell out, but Michael, they don't know what they're talking about. But I get it. I'm starting to get a feeling. I'm phoning people. And it's the poet who became president. And I said, let me meet with them. I called them back and said, this thing might happen. Come with your best pitch. And they're going to meet me in Holland. So scene three in this movie, it's eight 30. My phone rings. I was in Keith's room until six 30. It's my assistant. She says, the people from President Hovell's office are here. And I go, I'm dying. I don't believe it. I completely forgot. Ask them if they could just have coffee or something. I'll get shower and dressed. Tell 'em 20 minutes. I scurry about send them up. I open the door and it's Jerry Garcia and Alice Cooper. I mean, he looked like you with sandals. And he's the president's assistant and the Minister of Economics has black mascara all black. And I go, this is my kind of meeting. The beatniks have taken over the country. 
Speaker 1 (01:07:16):
Amazing. 
Speaker 2 (01:07:17):
I actually woke Mick after the meeting. See, you won't believe it. The beatniks have taken. He says, I knew that. I went, I know I'm an idiot, and I know you. He does follow those things more than I did. He does. The best they could offer was to send his plane. He had a plane. And I went, but we have a plane. They had nothing to offer, but we spent time. We looked at the map and I said, we have to compromise. So instead of the stage going here and playing to 250,000, we're going to put the stage here and play to 150, 
Speaker 1 (01:07:52):
Which still risky in a country that I was, the music had been illegal in this country until very recently. Yes. 
Speaker 2 (01:07:59):
This was like six months. 
Speaker 1 (01:08:02):
So six months ago, you could not buy or hear. No, there were bootlegs. There were people's money, but legally it was against the law. That's 
Speaker 2 (01:08:10):
Right. Well, everywhere we went in those days, the stones couldn't go to Japan. But we agree to do the show and we're going to lose money. But it's okay. The band are fine with it. We're all very excited. We're worried because we're going to go on sale. In fact, we had a pool amongst all of us. I took 78,000. I was closest. We sold 115,000 the first morning we sold out bingo. Now we made it cheap. It was like 20 or $25. And the interesting thing then was he's the most super person, gentle gentlemanly. He invites us. Lori McGorry ends up on the front page of the New York Times, Blondie McGorry with the Rolling Stones, because the Prague castle, which I think they've torn down, but is the largest castle in the world, and we're invited to go for tea with President Hale and his wife. 
Speaker 2 (01:09:11):
We go in, we walk and we walk and we walk. But the Russians have stolen everything. They stole the floorboards, they stole the lights, they stole the wallpaper, they stole everything. This is the most decrepit, looking, nonsensical palace for president you've ever seen. We walk into the room where Haas and he's got a desk and two chairs. There's like, I can't remember, five or six Rolling Stones, me and Lori at the time, and we're chatting and the concerts the next day. But he wanted to see us first. Do you speak English? Yeah. He spoke English and we hear this noise in the courtyard. 
Speaker 2 (01:09:57):
And then finally, could you explain to us what that noise is? And he says, well, that's the courtyard. There's about 15 or 20,000 people in the courtyard. Were hoping you would say hi. But I go, what are they chanting? And he says, they're chanting, thank you so much, president Halve for bringing the Rolling Stones. Now we know we're truly free, which was what they told me in the hotel. And I told the band, I forgot this part, but the reason we had to do the concert was so that they'd know that it was legitimate. It proved that they were free. The Rolling Stones. So he opens the doors, we go out on the balcony, they're screaming, and the press are there, which is great. It's fine. Vel goes out, the band goes out, everybody's crying. Even Charlie Watts, the hardest human on Earth, has tears in his eye. And there's a picture goes to the front page of the New York Times and every else in the world. And Lori McGorry happened to be standing there next to the Rolling Stones. Crazy story. Beautiful. What a story. Beautiful. And then we play the show and it's like, how'd it go? Phenomenal. It was beyond phenomenal. We got to know the president and his wife, and our slogan for the show was Tanks roll out, stones roll in. Wow. 
Speaker 2 (01:11:21):
And so everywhere you went in town was stone stones. There'd be one bread in a bakery. There was no furniture. It was terrible, but it was the most wonderful time. 
Speaker 1 (01:11:35):
Tell me about the music world in 1969. You started in 
Speaker 2 (01:11:38):
1969. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, I did. I started in 1969. I was 21. Nobody would sell me anything. Ricky goes, I got a great idea. We're going to open a strip club, which was perfectly legal. I said, you're right. We're going to have the first all nude strip club. What is this G-string and pasties crap. We'll shut down. All the other businesses have, is it legal? Well, we're hippies. We got Lake Beard like you hair down to here. It's the sixties. How can the human body be illegal? Of course, the lawyer tells it's illegal. We go, screw them. They're wrong. And we do it. We open it up, we run out of money. We find a bowling alley, we fix it up. We get it ready, and we're out of money. We don't know how to promote it. And we thought that the best idea was to bring the press in and some public, and we called it the undress rehearsal. 
Speaker 2 (01:12:42):
So we had our undress rehearsal. Now, in these days, there's only one TV channel in Canada. It's called the CBC, Canadian Broadcast Corporation, like BB, C. We're part of the Commonwealth. It's the CBC. They come to the undress rehearsal amongst other things. And we say to them, you can film, but don't film the girls. Don't film the girls and don't put it on tv because if you do, we're all going to get in trouble. I wasn't worried about them so much as I was worried about, there goes all our money. Ricky and I had like 10,000 in the world, some of which to this day, when I think back of it, we each went to the Bank of Commerce and borrowed $5,000. That's where the 10,000 came from because all the drug money had gone to the lawyers to get us out on bail. Anyways, what happens is they come, they film it, and there's only one national news at the time, and they show it and they show the girls nude. 
Speaker 2 (01:13:40):
Wow. So two things happen. We're on the front page of every newspaper. My mother calls from Toronto to say, I have an appointment for you with a psychiatrist. You clearly need help. My uncle calls and says, you're about to get arrested. You're in trouble. And we get arrested. Wow. So our next, we're going into legitimate business idea. As we got arrested 34 times, they would come in every day, 34 times. Well, it took a while for our lawyers. Ultimately, you learn all these new concepts, talk about a different kind of creativity where the lawyer finally goes to the judge and says, you have more money than they're making in bail. They're bailing the girls out every day. Ricky would go in Monday and I'd bail him in the girls out. I'd go In Tuesday, he'd bail. Like we had to take turns. And then ultimately the judge went, yeah, you're convicting them without a trial. No more arrests till there's a trial. 
Speaker 1 (01:14:38):
Wow. 
Speaker 2 (01:14:40):
The guys we're partners with are in the music business, and we're starting to do music in Toronto, and we're starting to get a feel. 
Speaker 1 (01:14:50):
Tell me, starting to do music in Toronto, what does that look like? Tell me what that means. 
Speaker 2 (01:14:53):
Well, one of the dope dealers, three of the dope dealers saw Nick Gord Bregman essentially started a company called Saul. Nicky, Gord Bregman. We were all pissed off at them because we went, that's such a good idea. Why didn't you include us? And they went, well, we were just a B. And somebody said, why don't we bring the who? And so we all invested. And that's what I mean by starting. I see. They did everything. I gave them $2,500. 
Speaker 1 (01:15:20):
And do you know, I have a feeling this story is not unique in that people your age all over the United States who were entrepreneurial might've had a similar story at that time that was in tune with what was going on in the world at that 
Speaker 2 (01:15:36):
Point. I think you're right. Although ultimately a few years later, we would describe it as, oh my God, somebody just offered four times for the Moody Blues, what we offered. And I said, oh, somebody had a Bar Mitzvah. Just step aside, you can't fight that battle. Hopefully he loses money and away we go. 
Speaker 1 (01:15:54):
Was that a typical thing? 
Speaker 2 (01:15:56):
There were so many newcomers, but we were the newcomer when we got into it. There was a guy in town named Marty on Rotten. He was the man. 
Speaker 1 (01:16:07):
And how big was music at this point in time? What would be the size of the venue that you would be dealing with? How many people would come 
Speaker 2 (01:16:15):
The first show? Nobody would sell me anything. So eventually there was a guy in California named Jack McFadden. I dunno if you know him. 
Speaker 1 (01:16:27):
I don't know him, but I've heard his name. 
Speaker 2 (01:16:28):
Yeah, he had Buck Owens, 
Speaker 2 (01:16:32):
Kind of Ricky and I had never heard of Buck Owens. So we went out and bought Five Buck Owens records at Sam, the record man, as opposed to Sam, the Chinese Food Man, as opposed to Sam, the strip club man. And we went and bought Five Buck Owen Records, went and smoked a lot of pot and listened to Buck Owens and went, this guy's fantastic. Like Holy Smokes. And nobody wanted to bring Buck Owens. So we did a deal for Buck Owens to play Maple Leaf Gardens. So our first show was at an 18,000 seat, but we didn't know anything. And I'm not saying anybody did anything crooked. I don't have any proof. And in these days you can't even proof the truth. But Bucking ones had 15 number one albums and 20 number one singles. And we didn't fill the floor. The floor holds 2,500 seats. 
Speaker 2 (01:17:19):
We didn't fill the floor. We sold 2300 seats total out of how many again? 18,000. 18,000. Yeah. We lost everything. And actually, you know how things work out sometimes. Yeah. It was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it's intermission and Buck's backstage. My buddy Jack isn't even there, and Buck doesn't want to know about withholding tax. He's not going on unless we give him back the withholding tax because somehow he doesn't recognize he's in a foreign country. I don't have the withholding tax. I've lost everything in the world. But Jesse James, of all names, is the guy who manages the building. He's there and he's saying, I'm calling the police. I'm closing the show. It's over. I said, oh my God, you can't. You can't. You can't. And I know the guy, Harold Ballard owned Maple Leaf Gardens at the time. So I said to him, is Harold in the building? 
Speaker 2 (01:18:16):
He says, yes, but he won't see you. I said, I think he might. My father is Phil Cole, and he buys boilers. Harold had a hockey team in a building, but his real business was making boilers for all of the manufacturing in Toronto. And I said, just tell him, Phil Son's here. Don't even tell Ms. Michael, Phil Cole's son's here. I met Harold Baller for the first time that night. He handed me the money. He said, you're never going to fucking pay me back. It's exactly how he said it, but I like your father. And I said, I'm going to pay you back. And I got to meet him. Now, ultimately, he's my benefactor. He takes me in, he trains me, he backs me. And it's all because Buck Owens refused to pay his taxes. Amazing. Worked out. Tell me about getting sober. 
Speaker 2 (01:19:05):
I'd had it. I got up in the morning one morning going to work, and I was like, I couldn't feel my face. I'd fallen down and that was it. I stopped. I was lucky. I had great willpower. I didn't go to group or aa or anything. I just stopped. Amazing. But for me, it was harder to quit smoking. I mean, it was my smoking. I've been in an addict all along. I quit drugs. I immediately went into gambling, bankrupted the whole family. Lori had to threaten to leave me and kill me. So I had to quit gambling, which is where the superstition came in, because I think she came in one day and said, I didn't sign up for this. Three TVs and bookmaking. Oh, I was bookmaking two and betting 25,000 a game and getting stiff by the guys who'd kill me. So I'd pay, but not getting paid for the guys who, and she went, this isn't what I signed up for. And I said, again, that moment, same thing in the business. I said, you know that stomach ache you've been having, which my sick view of the world is either our next son or cancer. Either way, you need to go to the doctor in the morning. You go to the doctor in the morning. And I swear on his life, I will never bet again. 
Speaker 1 (01:20:26):
Amazing. You've seen amazing things. What are life? I have seen some good stuff. I think because you've come at it from the point of view of a fan, 
Speaker 2 (01:20:34):
I'm still a fan. Yeah. 
Speaker 1 (01:20:35):
I think that's the secret. It's like that's why 
Speaker 2 (01:20:39):
It's part of it. No doubt. I think so. No doubt. 
Speaker 1 (01:20:41):
I think so. 
Speaker 2 (01:20:43):
I remember once saying to my mom, how come you never lined up to go and see any shows? And she says, because there were different generations so secretive. She said, well, I slept out all night at the Winnipeg Arena to get Frank Sinatra tickets in the forties. And so there's just, it's all happened the same. Only different, right. 
Speaker 1 (01:21:06):
Amazing. 
Speaker 2 (01:21:07):
Yeah. 
Speaker 1 (01:21:09):
How's Broadway different than the concert business? 
Speaker 2 (01:21:13):
Broadway and being a producer is much, much harder than being a promoter. It's the hardest thing. Well, that in film, I've done a lot of films. It's all still connected, but it's really, really, really hard because you don't have the songs recorded by Pink Floyd and you don't have the a hundred million albums. You have a blank sheet of paper and you want to do something, but it's so hard to get it right. And we failed so many times. We've had some success. I like to say we've done slightly better than Jeter, and he's in the Hall of Fame. So that's what you need to do. I'm a big Yankee fan. Are you a baseball fan at all? 
Speaker 1 (01:21:52):
No. The only thing I watch is Pro wrestling. 
Speaker 2 (01:21:56):
Pro wrestling. 
Speaker 1 (01:21:57):
And Maple Leaf Garden is a classic wrestling venue venue. 
Speaker 2 (01:22:01):
I did the first Hulkamania 
Speaker 1 (01:22:02):
Amazing at 
Speaker 2 (01:22:03):
CE stadium. I convinced Vince to go outdoors. He'll remember this. And we're at CE stadium and it's being broadcast worldwide. And we got Hulk fighting Andre the Giant for the title, and it goes live broadcast at eight o'clock. And the ticket company screwed up the map on the floor. So if you were supposed to be a 16, there's no a 16. 
Speaker 1 (01:22:32):
Oh no. 
Speaker 2 (01:22:33):
And it's seven 15. And Vince McMahon is cussing me and cursing the day he met me and we don't know what to do. And we've sold 50,000 tickets. They never played a stadium before. I loved wrestling. Yeah. 
Speaker 1 (01:22:46):
Yeah. That's a wild story. 
Speaker 2 (01:22:47):
So we just told everybody to sit down. If you weren't happy, ask for your money back. So nobody got to sit in their seats. But there's one of those nights that, again, in the book, it would be unbelievable because we ended up at a Greek restaurant and hooks to my left is a big fella, and then Andre, the big fella, is on the right. And my first thought is, if they fart, I'm dead. It's like, if they fart, I'm dead. What's the craziest ticket request you ever got? Oh God. What a story again. It's another one of those. I've been in Keith's room. I go back at six o'clock, seven o'clock, the phone rings at seven 15. I am Fog Bound, but I hear, I go, hello? Hello. He goes, yes. Is this Michael Cole? I am not going to admit I'm Michael Cole because I always think it's some Bowhead looking for a stones ticket. 
Speaker 2 (01:23:50):
And it's on a Stones tour, and we're in Washington and it's the lead up to the first night. And I go, who's this Buck Rogers? Do you know Buck Rogers? Yeah. The character. Yes. I go, well, this is Captain Kirk. What would you like? I'm going, this is such shit, buck Rogers. He says, no, no, no. This is Buck Rogers. And he goes, I'm a board Air Force two. I don't know. There's an Air Force two. I start laughing. I go, ha, ha ha. Hold on, I'll get Spock. Hello, this is Spock. And he goes, no, this is Captain Bug. Rogers a board Air Force two, and Vice President Gore would like to speak with you. Now. I am so fricking embarrassed. Get on the phone. We've heard that there's a rehearsal tomorrow night where you're running through the show, and it would be great if I could get my two daughters. Of course, we arrange it, but it was like Captain Buck Rogers on Air Force two, take a hike, buddy. Amazing.
