[00:00:08.700] - Speaker 1
Tell me your first memory of music. My dad's Burrylives records, Froggy Winterkorten. Froggy Winterkorten, and he did ride. Froggy Winterkorten, and he did ride. Now, I understand this is Burlives songs. I'm going to say three or four years old, My dad was not a big music listener. But the folk songs that came along, There's a hole in my bucket. This is on the same record. There's a hole in my bucket. There liza, there liza, there liza. There's a hole in my bucket. There liza, a hole. It was a long story song. It was along the said, You fill it with water, you get yourself a knife, and then you cut a piece of straw, and then you put the straw in the hole in your bucket, and then you fill the bucket with water, And then the final sentence of the song is, But there's a hole in my bucket. And that was it. That was my first memory. You're three or four years old. Your older brother or sister knows how to put something on the turntable Oh, another great one, Streets of Laredo. That was on that record, too. He had a very high voice.

[00:01:36.910] - Speaker 1
I've since found it. I found that recording on iTunes. As I walk out in the streets of Laredo, Rado. I didn't understand it until, I think one of my older brother's sisters said, It's a ghost song. The Cowboy is a Ghost. Scared to live in the daylight, Adam. That would have been, I'm going to say, 1959, 1960.

[00:02:03.270] - Speaker 2
What was the first time that there was music that you felt like, This is my music?

[00:02:07.150] - Speaker 1
I will tell you, it was probably the Dave Clark. No, wait a minute. I'm going to go back a few years prior to them. Heard Ray Charles's. It was a hit at the time. Hit the road, Jack. My dad was in his second marriage. I was maybe five. We were living in Reno, and we had just moved. We had moved around a lot, and we had just had another big move that had happened. We were living in a small apartment somewhere. I understood that a woman was saying, Well, hit the road, Jack. Well, woman on woman, homewoman, don't treat me this way. I'll be back on my feet someday. Don't care what you do because you're just no good. You ain't got no money. I guess if you say so, I have to back the bags and go, That's right. Hit the... The idea of the road, and I remember sitting on the on the curb, and I thought there were two definitions of hitting the road. One was leaving and the other one was literally taking your fist and bonking it on the paper. And that led into listening to the music on the radio, particularly at night when it would be on a long drive because we lived in Reno, and I think oftentimes, there were tricks to Sacramento or various parts of Northern California, and the radio would come through.

[00:03:29.770] - Speaker 1
And You could sit, particularly at night time, you could sit and hear the radio, and it was playing songs like Leslie Gore's It's My Party. I just thought, Leslie Gore must be the most beautiful woman in the world. It's My Party, and I'll cry if I want to. But then, oh, it's funny you should answer this. The big one for me was the Tokens, The Lion Sleeps Tonight, high falsetto voice. Because I was only five, I could sing the high part. In the jungle, the mighty jungle.

[00:04:02.860] - Speaker 2
Still can.

[00:04:03.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah. No cigarettes, and don't drink too much. But I felt transported to a jungle, and there was a lion out there. So I envisioned the villages around their huts and around the fire feeling safe because the lion was sleeping tonight, you see. Very evocative stuff. When you're five, six years old and the car is quiet because it's nine o'clock, 9:30 at night, and the radio is playing, and someone up there in the front seat is controlling it a little bit, and they'll turn it up and they'll turn it down. And you could say, Turn this one up. And they turn up the lion sleeps tonight. I was the youngest in the family, you see. So there were high school girls. My stepsisters were in high school, and they listened to everything. They lived and died by what was on the radio. And in fact, the first time I heard any song by the Beatles was when the marriage had run its route by then, and they had gotten divorced, but they still came by every now and again. And once they pulled up, and there were my stepsisters and my former stepmom in the back of the car, and they were covered with Beatles merchandise.

[00:05:21.470] - Speaker 1
They had Beatle pens, I love Paul, things like that, other Beatles stuff. And I remember hearing, Please, please me. And I had heard about the Beatles. This would have been I was in second grade by then. Just might have been as early as '63. No, it would have been after. It would have been early 1964. The Beatles had not been on the Ed Sullivan show yet. So I'm going to say this It was probably January of 1964. Early yet, Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan on the 13th of February. John F. Kennedy had been killed. The entire nation was in mourning, made it through Christmas, New Year's, heading back to school. One Friday night, sometime in January, the step family shows up again to talk to my dad or work out. Some of the girls were always friendly, and they were lovely. Out of it came this song. I remember being confused. I didn't know which one was Paul and which one was John, but I could read it on their buttons. I'm literally leading in the window of the car as they're sitting around, they're just stopping out. And There was this thing, Please, please me.

[00:06:31.790] - Speaker 1
They said, This is them. Oh, turn it up. Turn it up. Please, please me. My brother and sister were both older than I. My sister was five years older than me. Then the radio became as important as the TV out of San Francisco listening to KYA radio, KFWB radio, the radio stations, and there it just all spun out. Chubby Checker, The Beatles, The Dave Clark, 5, later on, Tommy Row, You heard everything on Top 40 radio back then because you'd hear Johnny Cash, and you'd hear Vince Gralby playing music. You heard jazz. You heard Louis Armstrong singing Hello, Dolly. At the same time, you were hearing the Rolling Stones and Jan and Dean, more Leslie Gore. The Motown stuff started coming out. And I remember there was this TV show called the Lloyd Faxton Show. He was a big presence in Los Angeles. He had essentially a record hop show. It was a daily half hour version of American bandstand that was syndicated. We saw it up in San Francisco. They would have the acts that would come by and lip sync to their songs. And I did not know the Supremes were black until they sang on the Lloyd Faxton show.

[00:07:56.920] - Speaker 1
And I thought they were three of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. And they were black. I didn't see a lot of black people on TV outside of maybe Paul Robeson on the Ed Sullivan show. So I got lucky because I came about of being cognizant of music when it was specifically aimed at young people, and it began just before the big British invasion, then the Beatles came along. I remember thinking even as early as 1961, 1962, that Elvis was this old guy who was just a movie star in really cheesy movies. So it was only what? It was only eight years after Elvis was Elvis. But by the time the Beatles came along, he was already as old as Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra. Wow. Yeah, he was already. He was already done.

[00:08:51.590] - Speaker 2
When Kennedy was shot, was that a big deal in your household?

[00:08:54.990] - Speaker 1
It was huge in that I was alone when I got the... I was in school, And the first thing... The principal never walked into our class. We were drawing pictures. I was drawing pictures of ships and whatnot. And the principal showed up in the class. And he walked over and he said something to the teacher, and then he walked back out. And then just a few minutes later, the teacher was crying. She was in tears. And she said something like, The President's been killed. The President's been killed. And okay, I'm in second grade. And then, literally, like timing from a movie, you couldn't have asked for a better editorial choice. This voice came over the loudspeaker. Your attention, please. This is the principal. The President of the United States has been shot. We are now going to be releasing you from school, and you are to go home as quickly as possible. And I don't know where my brother and sister were, but maybe because our class got out a little bit earlier or something, but I ended up walking home by myself from Lakeside Elementary School to my aunt's house where we were living.

[00:10:05.680] - Speaker 1
And there were no cars on the street. It would have happened about what time was Kennedy shot in Dallas. I think it was maybe one in the afternoon. So It was early in the day, and so I'm walking home, and there's nobody out on the street. There's no school busses. No parents were coming by to pick up their kids. I guess some of them did later on, but I'd walk to school by myself anyway. So I just walked home in this odd haze. I'm sure it's because I'm remembering it now, 50 some odd years after the fact. But I remember the sunlight seemed different. Of course, the sun was at a different angle because I was out of school early.

[00:10:45.380] - Speaker 2
You were normally in school at that time.

[00:10:46.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was completely quiet, and the house was quiet. I think my uncle was sleeping because he worked nights. Then began a heaviness that I don't know that a seven-year-old kid can figure out what has happened to all these grownups? They've all gone silent. They all have looks on their faces of something. I remember there might have even been talk about phrases like, not since Pearl Harbor. And I didn't know what Pearl Harbor was. Then there was probably three... Okay, because that was on a Friday, and I believe the funeral was not till Sunday. And I'm going to say, Rick, that I might not be accurate on this. Maybe it's just because we've replayed it so much, but I swear, perhaps inaccurately, that we were watching television when Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement. Wow. Yeah. I'm going to say we were there because that was all that was on TV. And one of the stations didn't have it, but for some reason. And of course, all of our parents were sitting around walking around. We didn't have big TVs back then. It was just a small console, small screen TV. It was on a stand that we wheeled around with rabbit ears.

[00:12:12.850] - Speaker 1
And all of a sudden, all we were doing, the TV was on all the black and white TV, all these news reports. So you're seven years old, you realize that something has shifted here in a big, big way. And musically, that wake or that funeral went on for a month. It went on for a really super long time, which meant that the joy that the Beatles brought. Now, okay, the Beatles song, they were called the Beatles because of the percussive rhythm. Everything was a jangly high hat, very specific beat that came out of it, along with these harmonies that you never heard before. But this energy is done, and it just sounded It sounded brand new. It sounded brand new because we'd been listening to Chubby Checker up to that point. A limbo rock, and let's do the twist. That's the stuff that we're listening to. And it set out this came, and then we saw them. We saw them on TV, and they were just so gorgeous. And they had these black suits on, and they looked nothing like the generation of performers that had come quite before. It must be because no doubt about it, because I was young and we had gone through so much upheaval to that point.

[00:13:36.290] - Speaker 1
But that oppressed... It was like getting out of the most smoky, dense, incomprehensible, sad, serious church service for weeks. Then coming out instead, there's a carnival right there, and the carnival was- It's almost like the Beatles were the birth of the '60s, essentially. I believe they were. I'll take that point. And you know Later on, marijuana and stuff like that pot came in later on like that. It was literally just the sound and the cut and the joy. I will say joy. Later on that same year, when we finally went to the auto movies, the drive-in theater and convinced our dad, he was a single parent, he worked crazy hours in the restaurant. He would take us on occasion to the drive-in, and he would fall asleep while we're watching movies like Zulu or Rhino or some bad Elvis Presley movie. But he took us to see A Hard Day's Night. And my brother and my sister and I still comment on sitting in the car and seeing that. And we can remember all sorts of individual bits that not only were joyful, but they also slayed us. It was just so funny. I'd be excited by that eventuality, things like that.

[00:14:56.090] - Speaker 1
So it was all-encompassing birth of a brand 10 new era. So we had crossed the nation, and I think we had crossed a Rubicon. That was the difference between then and now, and it was because of the Beatles. And I've since done a lot of research on it for movies and stuff like that. And a week after, the Beatles were on three weeks in row. All right? Then there was two weeks off, and Ed Sullivan had said, I want you to go to England and you find me in the next Beatles because they were ratings gold. And they came back with the Dave Clark Five. The Dave Clark Five appeared two weeks in a row. That was in, I'm going to say March or April. And you could not have convinced me that the Dave Clark Five were not the absolute complete equal to the Beatles. They were still gorgeous, and they sang glad all over in bits and pieces and stuff like that. It was the same joyful sound. But yeah, I think you're right. I think it was birth of the '60s.

[00:15:58.700] - Speaker 2
At that point in time in the UK, I think the Dave Clark Five and the Beatles were considered equals at that point.

[00:16:06.140] - Speaker 1
It was the Tottenham Sound versus the Mersey Beat versus the Tottenham Sound. I've since got to know Dave Clark in a couple of times, a couple of things. And he was the one man, everything. He told me that he was a bit of a stunt man. He was a very good-looking guy. I mean, incredible. If you put them all together, you say, who's the best-looking? If you put the Stones and the Beatles and the Dave Clark Five together, you would have picked out Mike Smith and Dave Clark as being the most gorgeous guy. And Paul McCartney would have been a bronze medalist there. So he had done some movies. He had done a stunt. He drove like some car in some cheap little movie. He got paid $600 for the gig, and he took that $600, went into a studio because he was a bit of a drummer himself, put together a band of his pals who had been doing one-night stands, and they recorded Glad all over. And that was That was their first number. That was the number one hit. And yeah, they were compared with... I remember issues of Tiger Beat magazine, in which the cover would literally be Who's Better, the Dave Clark 5 or the Beatles.

[00:17:14.890] - Speaker 1
You had to vote. Just like they would put up Who's Better The Beach Boys or the Four Seasons? Who has the better stuff? Everybody had an opinion, and I was of the opinion that Dave Clark 5 were a little bit better than the Beatles.

[00:17:27.910] - Speaker 2
When did that change or did it ever change?

[00:17:30.250] - Speaker 1
I think what happened was everybody got surly. Times changed in the household because my dad moved on and he got married again. We had a whole other family. And by that time, we were getting into 10 years old, 11 years old. And you start living a life that is outside your house because being at home is not all that much fun. And when my brother brought home Frank Zappa and the mothers of Invention and started listening to Cream, that was the great divide because I just wanted to go back to... By that time, it was all Beatles all the time because the White Album had come out, Revolver had come out, Rubber Soul had come out. And I think I probably listened to only to the... By choice listening to the Beatles until the very first record I bought on my own when I had some money was John Denver. John Denver's Aerie, A-E-R R-I-E. It had covers of the city of New Orleans, I'm riding on a city of New Orleans.

[00:18:36.070] - Speaker 2
What a great song.

[00:18:37.240] - Speaker 1
Oh, that was beautiful. And John Denver did a very beautiful melodic version of it that was loaded with songs about social justice. So I felt as though my brother had disappeared into this other... I think he probably started smoking pot around then, and his friends were always lingering around waking me up because we shared a bedroom at three o'clock in the morning where their laughter. And they They started listening to traffic and loading zone and all that other stuff that came out of San Francisco. Hendrix was... I didn't understand Hendrix for the life of me because I looked at it and said, How can there only be three guys in a band? The Jim Jimi Hendrix experience. And yet there was something amazing about just the lyrics of Purple Haze. And my brother actually went and saw the Jimmy Hendrix experience at the Oakland Coliseum, and he didn't tell me about it until afterwards. He came home, Where were you last night? I went and saw Jimmy Hendrix. I didn't think it was possible. I thought people go to rock and roll shows have to be in the army or something like that. I didn't realize a guy in junior high could just saunter down and go see it.

[00:19:47.050] - Speaker 1
I didn't listen to music really by choice until 1972. I got in high school and ended up harkening back because American Graffity was released in 1972, and it track was a monster of, believe it or not, Nostalgia Radio. It asked the question, Where were you in '62? And suddenly we're listening to Danny and the Juniors and Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly, which isn't necessarily 1962, but they were celebrating music that was all of 10 years old that had disappeared from the radio waves because it was no such thing as Nostalian radio. And that brought back nothing but old these stations. They were two huge oldies stations. Going back and hearing Van Morris and Brown-Eyed Girl for the first time. Going back and hearing Chuck Berry. I had never really ever heard Chuck Berry before until Nostalian radio came back. All these radio came back. And even Bill Haley rock around the clock, all that stuff. By that time, I was just in the maul of the commercialism.

[00:20:55.230] - Speaker 2
Do you think if that movie never came out today in culture, those artists would be less remembered than they are now?

[00:21:03.440] - Speaker 1
I think there's a good chance of it because it turned it into huge business. I mean, it's no small thing to release a soundtrack for a movie and have it be the number one record for a very a very long time. I remember Paula Matt. He says, Turn off that Beachboy shit, he says, because they've turned on I get around when he's driving around, round, round, get around, I get. Turn off that Beachboy shit, man. Rock and roll hasn't been the same since Buddy Holly Buddy Holly died? Wow. I said, Buddy Holly died? It ended up being this huge thing. But I think that's a real good question. It became huge business. All these became huge business. There were concert films that came out afterwards. Little Richard, better. He probably had some big ass paydays because his music came roaring back because of the nostalgia craze that really held for about, I'm guessing five or six years, from '72 to by the time I was in junior college, it had like spun itself out. And then a disco came along and good FM radio stations came up. Up in San Francisco, we had KSAN. That was the first time I ever heard Tumbleweed Connection by Elton John.

[00:22:18.110] - Speaker 1
And who's this guy? Blue canoe, stuff like that. Take me to the pilot and Honky Shateau. When that stuff started coming out. And Well, I still had a tendency to listen to old Jan and Dean records, but I was just trying to be funny. I didn't really have a musical taste, per se.

[00:22:40.320] - Speaker 2
At any point in time, did you consider doing music? No. Did you ever play an instrument?

[00:22:44.450] - Speaker 1
No, My brother played a little bit of guitar, but no, I didn't. I would do that thing with a pair of chopsticks. I would sit in my room and pretend to play the drums, but no, I had no musical inclination.

[00:22:58.290] - Speaker 2
Tell me about watching television growing up.

[00:23:00.750] - Speaker 1
I knew what time it was by what was on TV.

[00:23:03.330] - Speaker 2
What were your favorite shows?

[00:23:05.010] - Speaker 1
Well, we got UHF television, I'm going to say, when I was in eighth grade, and suddenly we had two more TV channels than we had had. And UHF television was independently owned. And suddenly, I would say the biggest thing that entered into my life TV-wise was reruns of Star Trek every day at 6:00 PM. Five days a week, Star Trek. I'd seen so many of them that I had a competition with a buddy of mine. We'd both be watching in our individual houses, and we'd be on the phone, and we'd try to scream the title of the show out as soon as we could figure out. Trouble with Tribbles. Balance of Terror. Something like that. I mud. We were yelling out the titles of the thing. But that got me into absolute fluky discovery when I was in eighth grade. There used to be good television coverage in the Oakland Tribune. There was a columnist every day who would talk about television and what was coming on. And I read in the morning or in the afternoon, I had read about this program called Film Odyssey that was on CBS. Now, CBS was a public radio station, so there were no commercials.

[00:24:22.600] - Speaker 1
It was hosted by Charles Champlin, who I did not know at the time, but he was a film critic for the Los Angeles Times. It was called Film Odyssey. What it did, it took films from around the world, old films that were classic, and they showed them uninterrupted. And I just wanted to see a movie without commercials. I thought that was unique. And I didn't quite understand jewels and Gem. That was on. I didn't quite understand Beauty and the Beast in French. But one night, there was going to be this thing with samurais on, sword fights, and they look really cool. The photograph was of two guys going at it with Samurai swords. One of them, I guess, was to hear on the. And I just said, Oh, hey, tonight I'm going to watch this thing. It's going to have really cool sword fights. And it was the Seven Samurai by Corusel. And this weird thing happened. I never stayed involved in a movie with subtitles on it because it was in Japanese with subtitles. And in a nanosecond, I forgot that I was reading subtitles. In my mind, I was actually understanding the Japanese.

[00:25:32.400] - Speaker 1
That stuff. That's what it sounded like. And I went to school the next day, and I was mesmerized by this thing because it had some of the coolest stuff. And it's a classic story that has been redone many times in the Magnificent Seven, what happened? Seven Samurai. And I understood it, even though it was about Japan, feudal Japan. I understood the story. I understood what's going on. I understood the peasants and the brigands and this ragtag collection of Ronin Samurai. And when I went to school the next day, I just assumed every guy in class had seen it. I said, God, did you guys see Seven Samurai last night? No one knew what I was talking. So that tuned me into this idea that there was something much farther beyond Star Trek at 6:00 at night. If you were a judicious chooser, if you perused what was on TV around it, you could find some really cool stuff. And not long after that, I started watching seeking out old Humphrey Bogart movies. Like, first time I saw, it was cut to ribbons, but the first time I saw the Maltese Falcon or Casa Blanca. When you see them for the first time, it doesn't matter that they're on a black and white television.

[00:26:38.970] - Speaker 1
They're just the most imagine. I remember watching a Bridge Over the River, Quai on the ABC Sunday Night movie And I'm thinking, this might be the greatest motion picture I've ever seen. It was in pen and scan technology, and I'm watching it in black and white. Then later on, able to search out series like Theater in America, which was doing... They did things like the Andersonville Trial that was essentially live videotaped theater of great plays. I ended up seeing a fabulous production of Cyrano de Bergerac that came out of San Francisco's own American Conservatory Theater. And I'd be late junior high, high school, and realize that I get this stuff, and yet it's still all a frigging mystery to me. I'm not sure why these things that look nothing like the movies I see regularly or that I to go see in the movie theater or that are delivered to me every night during the week. I'll go back again and again to like Elvis Presley movies or James Bond movies or Charlton Heston historical dramas. None of these things were like those at all. But they landed in my head in a way that is instinctively involved in it.

[00:27:51.280] - Speaker 1
But at the same time, I said, Man, there's so much stuff that I don't quite get from this. I'm not quite smart enough to understand the verbiage or the techniques. But it opened me up to a brand of curiosity that says, Hey, man, I want to see more of this stuff. Then getting into college, there was a theater in Berkeley on University Avenue called the UC. It was an ancient movie palace. It probably had 1,500 seats. They were trying to make a living show, I swear to God, a double bill of Tommy and Listomania. Tommy by the Who, a horrible movie, and Listomania, which I don't know, might have been a good movie, I have no idea. But the guy who owned it said, I'm losing my shirt doing this. I'm going to put forward the idea of a repertory cinema. What he did was seven days a week, he had a different bill. He would program it himself, and he would do things like show all three James Dean movies in one night. Nothing but Nicolas Ray movies for one night. Nothing but Truffaut movies for one night. And everybody I started getting the three-month-long calendars and putting them up on the refrigerators or the bulletin boards to just say, I'm going to see that one, I'm going to see that one, I'm going to see that one.

[00:29:09.130] - Speaker 1
And I ended up going to those things by myself because I couldn't get anybody else interested in going to see East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause and giant all in the same night. But shit, I did because this was all brand new stuff. The biggest thing that happened when I was 13 was 2001, a Space Odyssey. I saw it one weekend with some friends of mine, and I immediately went back the next Saturday to see it by myself because that was a blend of nothing but shots, color, sound, not even a lot of dialog, and I had to see it probably 15 times, but I could understand what was really going on with it. But from the get-go, from the very first moment, without knowing that I was watching Cinematic Art, without calling it Cinematic Art, bang, hit me on the head just like that. I said, Oh, something else is being communicated here in a completely different way, and I think I get it.

[00:30:08.080] - Speaker 2
Yeah. The idea that something that abstract could speak to you when you were that young says a lot.

[00:30:15.190] - Speaker 1
At the age of 13, yeah. I had a tendency to isolate a lot because I was the youngest in the family. A lot of times I just got lost in the shuffle, and a lot of times I was the only one home alone. I was never bored when I was there. I think some degrees of loneliness or something like that might have crept in, but I filled up that loneliness with some other degree of, let's just call it a type of curiosity that was different from going to school. I love going to school. School was action, man. School was fun. If you had a couple of classes you liked, that's all you needed to get out of it. But it was where things were popping, and I was always able to get up in front of people like it was nothing at all. But that was counterbalanced by long, long hours of being alone and creating stories, sometimes with toys, but sometimes just with the TV on, not really paying attention what was going on on it, but periodically looking at it and taking in this a subjective concept of image and sound and why something seemed really accurate and authentic and why other times it just seemed as fake as fake could be.

[00:31:22.150] - Speaker 1
And both of them would hold my attention for a while.

[00:31:25.170] - Speaker 2
Were you a big reader as well?

[00:31:27.370] - Speaker 1
I became a big reader when I was in high school, and I started reading what I like to say non-fiction novels by the likes of Leon Euris, who wrote historical things like Exodus, Mila 18, which was about the Warsaw Gadow in World War II. Armageddon, which was about the divided city that Berlin was. Exodus was about the formation of Israel. Then I would read Alex Haley books, airport, hotel, wheels, about certain types of industries. And they were all like turbulent, turgid soap operas. But along with it, too, would come some sense of news reporting, some sense of fact, some sense of history that really got super shifted when I read In Cold Blood by Truman Capote. It was one of those things. I knew it was a movie. I knew adults watched it. There was a book in the Skyline High School library that I said, I'm going to give this a shot. And it scared the living daylights out of me. And I read it in record time. It was one of those things that see kids reading on the bus on the way home from school instead of goof off. That's what I was when I was reading in cold blood.

[00:32:42.310] - Speaker 1
And it just terrified me. The randomness of it, what had happened to that family, the two guys that did it. And no small amount of what the prose of Truman Capote and what he made up and what he kept, what he fancied and what he imagined was all in there. And Man, oh, man. After that, I would say my reading taste really shifted because I started... I never read fantasy. I never read the Lord of the Rings. I didn't read that stuff. If it didn't happen or if it wasn't based on some real thing, it wouldn't hold my interest.

[00:33:17.200] - Speaker 2
Would you read non-conviction as well or no?

[00:33:19.840] - Speaker 1
I'm going to say no, because I don't think I read really serious non-conviction books until I was probably in my early 20s and read William William Manchester's biographies on Winston Churchill. William Manchester is a great storyteller, scholarly in ways that you need to be scholarly. But more than anything else, it's like, Oh, this guy told a story about Winston Churchill at dinner last night that I didn't want to end. It opens up, I distinctly remember, it opens up with almost a time machine trip back to Victorian England that was describing the daily life of your average Londoner at a time when Victoria was still on the throne. And this was the era in which Winston Churchill was born. And it talked about, among other things, how filthy the gin ghetto ghetos in London were. You know what a gin ghetto is? A gin ghetto is where all the poor people live who can't afford beer because it's expensive, but can afford gin because it's made so cheaply. So they were all drunk on gin all the time. It was their version of pot or their version of something. And I just thought huge swaths of poor, uneducated, illiterate people who are toiling around in sweatshorts shops and stuff like that or working as butlers or in that class service economy that the Britain was.

[00:34:52.360] - Speaker 1
And I just remember thinking, gin gettos? Man, oh, man, that's a different way of I'm not making it so serious. So I will say that's the bona fide non-conviction history. And after that, man, I can only get through certain non-conviction books because they're not written. I tried to read Barbara Tuckman's a distant mirror and the Guns of August so many times, and I just can't crack it after about 120 pages.

[00:35:22.940] - Speaker 2
The story is what drives your interest.

[00:35:25.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And also, I think what the author finds fascinating For example, Steven Ambrose. I started reading Steven Ambrose back when we started doing a Save and Private Ryan. And I met him. I think it's the desire to see history as a story that reflects who we are even now. Steven Ambrose told this great story. He went to the university, I think, in New Orleans or something in order to be pre-med. He was going to go pre-med, be a doctor. You had to take this one history class, the first class, and it's probably 200 people in the class. And the professor came out and gave his first lesson for an hour. And it was so mesmerizing talking about history in the importance of history and moments from history that Steven Ambrose said he went down at the end of the class to the teacher's desk and said, How do I get your job? That's what he said. He understood history is this great story that is about who we are right now. It's not locked away in some ongoing nostalgia. It's not about the mythic formation that never would have happened any other way. It's about people trying to get by doing one damn thing after the other in the face of terror or accident or trying to get out of a gin ghetto so you can improve your life somehow.

[00:37:01.070] - Speaker 2
It's also interesting when you read history from different periods of time about the same period of time, the history changes based on the culture of the time it's being written in.

[00:37:13.640] - Speaker 1
The perspective on what is important and what the connections were at the time. I just had this experience because I've read this book by William Manchester many times called A World That Only by Fire. I talk about it. The first time I read it, which is essentially about what life was like back at the end of the 1400s, right? It's about the 15th century that coincides beautifully with the start of the Renaissance and how people lived and how if you were an average Joe, meaning if you weren't landed gentry, if you weren't the clergy, and if you weren't a soldier, essentially, you work yourself to death and were hungry all the time. That's it. And you never traveled more than a few miles from the place you were born. So you always died pretty much right there. And yet at the same time, Gutenberg has invented the printing press. Martin Luther has come through with breaking with the papacy. Magellan has sailed around the world. Essentially, the renaissance has begun. And chances are if there's a cathedral being built in your town, either in Germany or Italy or France or Spain, your grandparents worked on that cathedral, and your grandkids will work on that cathedral because that's how long it takes to build them, right?

[00:38:32.440] - Speaker 1
Well, I read that, and I've gone back over and over and over again because I ended up spending some time in places where it takes place. I made a movie in Rome, I made a movie in Florence, I lived in London, I did all these things. So I was always reading it for this ongoing background to get an understanding of the difference between now and then. And I just now finished reading a book called The Swerve by a historic, and by the name of Steven Greenblatt, who I met not too long ago when I was in Boston. And I said, I've heard of you. I wrote this book called The Swerve. I said, I have a copy of The Swerve that I have it. Correct. So I opened it, and it is another window on to that same period of time. And it's not so much thematically different. But it ends up getting into a very different the division between the haves and the have nots. I mean, it's about the ongoing aspect of how crooked the papacy was, how insane everything, how You did not want to be called a heretic. You didn't want to be accused of being a heretic, because if you question anything about the church, you died a horrible death, and everybody showed up to watch and be entertained by how you were laid alive or burned alive or drawn from Portland.

[00:39:46.330] - Speaker 1
And it ends up, I think all these historical things, they pile up on each other. And even when they do, disagree. If you can read your average history of, say, the Apollo space program, there's a lot of stuff in there that people disagree with each other, historical data and also thematically. But you put it all together. What it is, it's just more of a complete picture that there's no definitive definition of what it is. With the same one damn thing after another that people went through back then When? Everybody's arguing still about the one damn thing after another that mattered the most. And it's all part of this big, massive card game that sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. And I can't get enough of that. I got to say, my wife, Rita, says, What historical book are you reading now? And I said, You don't want to ask that question because I'm going to start talking and I won't stop for the next hour in 45 minutes because I'm finding out nothing but fascinating stuff. But it's all about, I always think about this, what would I do if I was in that same circumstance?

[00:40:48.310] - Speaker 1
What would I do for a living if I were back there? What would I be interested in that? What courage would I have and what stands would I be willing to take? Ain't that the best version of any... When you hear a story well told, isn't that like part of the contract between the storyteller and the person who is hearing the story is what would you do in these same circumstances?

[00:41:14.210] - Speaker 2
I don't know about that. I think that's fascinating. That says a lot about you because when I read a historical story, I never imagine myself in that story ever. Seriously.

[00:41:24.760] - Speaker 1
Maybe you would if you read the next one, if you read another interpretation of what those that those same times are. Because some of them, of course, they do concentrate on the turget. They do want to be involved in the specific. Okay, say, for example, I've read plenty of stuff about D-Day. All right? Part of it was for research. Part of it because I'm fascinating. But there's other things I need to hear a little bit more about this stuff. And even there, there's some moments I never think for a moment, what would that mean? But there's other times I read it. If I'm 20 years old, and this is the first time I've seen combat, which is on D-day, what do I do? What do I trust? How afraid am I? What dumb thing would I do? And you also have to consider the fact, what if I just crawled up in a hole and stayed there for as long as possible and never put myself. All of these things are possible because we don't know. And even when I see... Go into the movies. And look, there's plenty of movies that are just sheer action adventure, and you want to be cool school.

[00:42:30.730] - Speaker 1
You want to kiss the girl and shoot the guy and ride the motorcycle and pet the dog. You want to do all those. But then there's other aspects of it where you just think, who would I be in this story? Would I be the hero? Would I be the villain? Would I be the goat? Would I be the empowered? What would I do if I was in these same circumstances? When I see those type of movies and I come out, that's the stuff that you end up talking with your friends heatedly about over coffee afterwards or the next time you all get other.

[00:43:01.190] - Speaker 2
When you read a script, are you focusing on the story of the script, or are you paying attention to what your character would do, and is it right for you?

[00:43:11.160] - Speaker 1
It's the theme is the first thing that has to be evident. And that theme then, if it's definable, has to then be worthy of doing all the work of a movie in order to examine it. What are we talking? What's the option here? I will tell you, I made a There's a movie called Charlie Wilson's War. It was written by Aaron Sork and it was directed by Mike Nichols. We talked theme constantly about, and I don't know that we agreed. I'll tell you that right now. I don't know what we agreed about. Actually, Charlie Wilson was alive. I mean, he was around. I talked to him all the time about, Charlie, what are we doing here? What was the point of all of this stuff? After you understand what everybody has to agree that this is the movie that we're making, you have to come to a collective thing. Once you agree what the movie is making, then anything you bring to what that question is going to be is valid because there's no right way. Because it's literally, how do we solve this problem? It's like a scientific thing. How many different ways can we come at examining this theme?

[00:44:20.610] - Speaker 1
After that, then most screenplays are very malleable because you get together with them. They're usually written by somebody and directed by somebody else. If you're doing it right, you're always, always, always testing the material. The work that I feel like I have to do as the actor is, number one, show up on time. This is very important because time is money. You have to know the text, and by text, I mean certainly your own dialog, but also that of everything else that is going on in the scene, what other people are doing and what they mean by what they say, you have to know that. But you also You have to have an idea in your head that you haven't told anybody about, that you haven't shared with anyone. You have to come in with an understanding of what your character is, what he was doing right up to that point, what he's experiencing in the course of what the scene and then what he does with that information. And it constantly varies. It always goes on. You can prepare for it for up to a certain extent, but it's not unlike writing, except you don't have to sit down on the laptop.

[00:45:32.060] - Speaker 1
You don't have to come up with 1,500 words every morning. But you do have to come up with the superstructure. I like to use those words. The superstructure for what happens in that scene. And there's actually very little that you can bring out in the verbiage of it. There is the interpretation of the lines. There's the give and take with the other characters. There's also body language. There's how you stand, how you sit. Just today is a matter of fact, I was just having lunch, and I found myself holding a fork and a knife, and I'm thinking about this possibility that we might be doing in the next year or so. And I just thought, Hey, I think this is the way he eats. I think he holds his knife and fork like that. Oh, I'm going to remember this because it will communicate something that is so ephemeral. Now, maybe no one will I get it. But as long as I present it, that means that behavior is up there on the screen. So when you get around to the story. The story is plot in all honesty, and that stuff is give and take.

[00:46:42.830] - Speaker 1
You make that stuff up on the day. Why are you coming in? And why do I go to the window? And what happens when he comes in and says that stuff? That is literally the easiest stuff in order to discuss. The harder philosophical arguments that you can have with everybody on the movie, if you're smart, the director, the writer, everybody else that's in it, even the cinematographer. I mean, I've had talked about theme with the guys who are bringing the props in. It's like, wait, I think he'd smoke Chesterfields, guys. Why Chesterfields? You got to know something about Chesterfields. They never had a filter on them, and yet they weren't the cheap version like Lucky's... You had to have all this stuff going on. But then the unspoken part is what you're carrying around inside your head. Good actor, the great... I I've never worked with anybody that I didn't just respect like crazy, and I don't care who they are. I know that they're coming in with unspoken story in their pocket, ideas that I'm going to have to react to and divine simply by how they look at me, what their timing is like, and how authentic the scene is.

[00:47:49.800] - Speaker 1
And when that's meant, it's just magic time, man. It's not work at all.

[00:47:54.420] - Speaker 2
Would you say that there's a whole unspoken story going on between the actors that the person you're acting with has no idea about. They're doing the same thing. You have no idea what they're doing other than the surface. We know what the surface is, but everything below the surface is just happening. I'll use the word adlib, even though it's silent.

[00:48:19.810] - Speaker 1
You're absolutely correct. And I wish sometimes a movie could actually show all the takes that have gone on either side of somebody, right? That's a movie. They only use one.

[00:48:31.300] - Speaker 2
That's a movie. No, but that's an interesting movie idea. If it's a movie about making movies and showing all of that, it's really interesting.

[00:48:39.240] - Speaker 1
There's been a couple of movies that did that. I want to say, Hale Caesar by the Coen Brothers captured it at one moment with George Clooney at the end when he's playing the Centurion at the Crucifixion of Christ. I want to say in Mulholl and Drive, I want to say Naomi Watts does it in a scene with Chad Everett, which they're literally talking about the making of a movie. You I could say the same maybe for Truffo's Day for Night, but it's never really been captured anywhere else, which is one of the reasons why I wrote the book the way I did. But what happens is you're in there connected with somebody. Sometimes it's a woman, sometimes it's a guy, sometimes it's a bunch of guys, sometimes it's a group of people, and you're just going back and forth. If you could be present and see the difference between what you have just learned from the previous take and what you're going to try in this one, and the ongoing back and forth of... It's like a game of Black Jack, hit me. Oh, I'm going to stand. Oh, no, I'm going to... It is fascinating, and it's one of the most exciting thing that happens in a set?

[00:49:45.850] - Speaker 1
Because sooner or later, you're in a closeup, okay? And the close-up is never the first thing shot. You've done all sorts of other... So you have a wide understanding of where you can go in the scene. But if you You are off camera looking at your scene partners and you get a sense of how far they stretch things and how they change it around and how they give you something else and how they've discovered it themselves, when you come back around on you, you remember it, and then you start throwing other stuff back the same way. It's too bad that you could make... Actually, I might make a really great documentary. We have all 17 takes from both sides of this. Let's look at the other scene that this movie could have been. I mean, you could take the greatest motion picture scenes in the history. If you want to choose a couple of other takes that they did, it's a completely different scene and means something totally different and doesn't XIV or whatever. But you can't get to that final version. Of course, you don't get to make the decision either, because somewhere between the directors and the editors, and certainly the film score and everything else that goes along with it, altars it.

[00:50:57.280] - Speaker 1
But just the actors themselves, I think, have this moment where in their line, in their scene, in their moment, in the creative beat in the scene, they can change the direction of the entire movie with a nod of the head or a pause in the line, or in a new presentation of, I think, what the subtext is. Because all scenes are made up of two things: text, that's the words, and subtext, which is what those words mean as you say in a given moment. It's fascinating stuff. Sometimes it's intimidating as hell. I've worked with people who just scared the living daylight out of it because they're so good at what they've done. There's other times where I just said, I don't know where that came from, and I'm glad I stumbled upon it because I think it's actually something I didn't even see come.

[00:51:46.540] - Speaker 2
Has there ever been a moment where you've tried something in one take, a throw away moment that you didn't do in later takes, but for some reason, that one thing that you didn't think much of ends up being pivotal in a movie or a memorable scene or an emotional moment?

[00:52:04.950] - Speaker 1
It happens all the time, and it happens by accident. Sometimes it's something that you did remember trying that wasn't in the screenplay. I'll give you one. And by the way, no one's seen this movie. I made a movie with Emma Watson that was directed by James Ponzel from the Dave Edgar's movie, The Circle. It's about an internet thing. It was around for a while. There's a scene with me and Patty Oswald and Emma Watson. And we're internet moguls that are trying to convince this woman to do something that is not honest. And she has us over the barrel. And we did the scene, and we... Patty is a great actor, and Emma is incredibly gifted. And the three of us were having a really great time going around in this thing because it was a triangle. Patty wanted something, I wanted something, she wanted something, and none of them meshed. And at the end of on just out of nowhere before it was cut, it was the end of the scene. In character, I looked at and I said, We are so fucked. And he said, Yes, we are. And it ended up being the moment that the scene called for somehow.

[00:53:20.010] - Speaker 2
And it wasn't in the script.

[00:53:21.760] - Speaker 1
It was not in the script at all. And I think that's one version of it. But I worked twice now with Paul Greengrass. He directed United 91. He directed Captain Phillips and made a movie called News of the World with him as well. Well, he made Bloody Sunday. He's a great filmmaker, and he came out of documentaries. And when we were doing the Captain Phillips movie, we shot everything that was in the script for the end of the film. And we were on the ship, and we were actually talking to the actual participants of the day when Captain Phillips was rescued from the Somali pirate and everything that went along with it. And we were talking to the captain who was actually in command of the ship that rescued Richard Phillips. And Paul was English. He said, When exactly did you first have a Convergence. He was looking for something else to shoot, in all honesty. We had shot everything that was on paper. And we're just saying, We're here on the ship. We got a few hours. What else can we grab, which is a great way in order to make a film? And the captain said, Well, of course, I He was busy with the Department of Defense and all the Navy Seals and whatnot.

[00:54:34.420] - Speaker 1
So I didn't see Phillips until he got out of the infirmary. And Paul Greencrest said, The infirmary? Yeah. And he said, Yeah, I mean, the protocols is all of that. Anybody coming off something like that, he's got to be looked at the medics to find out if he's injured or anything like that. We had never heard this. Didn't know it. Wasn't in the book. Wasn't anywhere. We went down to the infirmary with Barry Ackroyd, who was our DP, me and Paul, and we walked into the folks that were on duty. A woman, I think her name was Cynthia, and her staff, she was in command of the infirmary. And we walked in, and it was like, they knew we were on the boat, the ship, and they wanted to maybe be in the movie because we're moving in the bulkheads around the deck and stuff like that. And they said, oh, my God. Hi. So Paul started saying, can I ask you a question? You know the story, right? Oh, yeah. Well, Phillips would have been brought to you in order for a checkup. What would you have done? And she just snapped into, well, what we would immediately try to do is get all these vital signs.

[00:55:42.810] - Speaker 1
We'd try to clean them up. We would have tried to figure out what blood was his? Was he injured? Had he been shot? Did he have any stab wounds? Was he malnervished? Was he dehydrated? We would just do the whole overall thing. And he said, you would actually have a procedure for it? I said, oh, yeah, it would be standard. He said, Well, if we dressed Tom up in all of his kit, he said, blood stains, ripped up shirt, the whole bit, do you think we could do it with you? And she said, You mean on camera? He said, Yeah. It would be like a drill. Could you just do it as a drill? And she said, Yeah, I suppose so. And I said, Great. And by that time, Barry Ackroyd, he worked with Paul before, so he was sticking up lights everywhere. He said, Oh, if we come around, because it was a very small space, I mean, very tiny space. And so I went off and got all my kit put back on and came in. And by that time, we had shot so much of me beaten, slapped around and beat up by the guys who played the Somali Pirate.

[00:56:41.890] - Speaker 1
So I was pretty much corked. I was still carrying that all around with me. And we did it. The first pass we did didn't go very far because they were nervous and they were a bit intimidated. And they said, no worries, no worries. And I just gave it, said, Look, this happens all the the time I've done it. You can't do anything wrong here. If it's not good, it won't be in the movie. Just try to say it straight out of your face because that's all we're trying to do. And if you think I haven't stopped the take in the middle of it because I'm not there, you're wrong. I do it all the time. So this is the This is the way movies are made. We did it. We probably did three or four takes of it. Every time it was her protocol, her behavior, and it was as natural as natural could be. We were done in about 40 minutes. And that was the epitome of understanding what the procedure is, getting somebody to do the actual physical behavior of it, but exploring another way to get deeper, deeper down into the theme of the movie, which in that scene was particularly a very gentle, pleasant human being, a woman telling Richard Phillips that you're going to be okay.

[00:57:56.930] - Speaker 1
You're okay now, which is like, I mean, come on. There's There's a lot of movie makers that would not have done that. There were a lot of people who have been satisfied with what they had who would think, well, we have these other scenes that can be the end of the movie. We'll figure something out. And that's a type of thing that if I had not had one absolute faith in Paul, as well as a shitload of experience of how to get there when the time comes that you have to get there. We would have missed out on that. And I also had had so many conversations with the actual Richard Phillips that I had plenty of written imaginings in my head of what he had been through and what he had seen, and it all came out in the scene. That was not in the script and was not on the shooting schedule and was only in the movie because Barry Ackeroid is fast with the lighting. Paul is fantastic with seeing what the possibilities are. And the crew that was inside there only behaved according to the protocol. The movie. And some people would say, Why would we do something so realistic like that?

[00:59:03.820] - Speaker 1
It's a movie. We can do something.

[00:59:06.110] - Speaker 2
Do you always do a lot of research before going into a role?

[00:59:09.930] - Speaker 1
There are some that you have to do, and there's others that you must not. For example, I made a movie called The Green Mile, directed by Frank Darabunt, the Stephen King novel. And as soon as I began doing research on what the character was, I realized that the authentic truth about being a guard on death row in a Louisiana State Prison would not match up with a motion picture. So I just stopped. I said, Okay, we're going to make up our own logic on this. And it was a good thing I did because I think that's a long prison movie that is still pretty damn hypnotic if you stick with it. So That's where you come into, like what I said earlier, everybody has to agree with the movie that they're making. They have to say, This is what we're doing. And if I hadn't said, Guys, I can't make this movie because Louisiana guards on Death Road did not wear uniforms that didn't have guns on their holsters. Well, if you're going to do that, you ain't in the movie. And you wonder, well, this is the better way to examine this theme than this other way.

[01:00:11.070] - Speaker 1
And you go because you can establish your own procedure and behavior. But everybody has to agree with what that procedure and behavior.

[01:00:21.060] - Speaker 2
How different are different directors stylistically?

[01:00:25.810] - Speaker 1
None has ever been the same as the other. Part of it is all directors come to their gig from some other perspective. Some are writers. Nora Efron was a writer, from books to screenplays to the movies that you read. Frank Darabont started off as... He was a guy in charge of swingang art direction. That's how he got into the movies. He started making sure the right wallpaper was in it. Ron Howard grew up. He knew he wanted to be a director when he was seven years old doing the Andy Griffith show with Barney Fife. Steven, of course, Steven Spielberg, he started directing movies when he was 10 and still directs them the same exact way as he did then, still does it with the same natural instinct. I guess the question is, how do they approach it? And I've done movies where we had three and a half weeks of rehearsal in which the set is taped out on the floor and you have props and you run the scenes and you do rehearse it and you get it downward perfect so that when the day comes, you're doing it. I've done movies where all we did for three and a half weeks was to sit around and talk about what other characters mean and what they do.

[01:01:38.710] - Speaker 1
Steven doesn't rehearse for a moment. Steven assumes that you're going to show up. You're going to know the dialog, and he will tell you where you are in the shot. And guess what? Turns out he's done all the work for you because the shot tells the entire story, and you are but a cog in it. I'm very lucky, I think, that because I came from repertory theater when I I was young, working with a lot of directors, our job was to facilitate the director's desires, not wait for the director to tell us exactly what to do. Because if you're doing that thing where you're going to say, Hey, why don't you move to the window? Well, why would I move to the window? What's my motivation for moving? No, you can't do it that way. He says, Hey, any way you can move to the window in this scene? I always say, Watch this. And then I'll come up I come up with my own reason to watch the movie or go out the window. If he asked me, why do you want to? I'll tell you, because I suddenly realized I let the window down in my car and it's part.

[01:02:40.020] - Speaker 1
I want to see if anybody's breaking. I can come up with any motor. That's my job. But the grand refreshment, if I could use it that way, is that everybody does this different, and everybody brings to it a different challenge and comfort level. And that's as part of the magic of the variety that you're going to make. Sometimes movies cannot be made any other way except in this incredibly artificial atmosphere of blue screens and hitting marks and focus places and stuff like that. I made a comedy with... Oh, man, I have it cranial plate shift. I'll scream his name out in a second. He was a cinematographer of The Godfather. Gordon Willis, for crying out loud. All right, so we're making the money pick, right? We're making a comedy called The Money Pit. It was about a couple that buys a house and it destroys them financially and almost destroys them as a marriage. Big, huge comedy directed by Richard Benjamin. And he said, Gordon Willis is going to shoot it. And I thought, Gordon Willis? Gordon Willis is going to shoot The Money Pit with our funny gags and our repartee and stuff like that?

[01:03:51.910] - Speaker 1
When I met him, I said, Gordon, I'm going to ask you a question. Why did you want to shoot this movie? He said, Because there's no reason that comedies can't be well shot. What he was saying is, I'm going to bring all of the composition and lighting and camera moves to a comedy that you'd bring to any great story. Of course, he made the greater Woody Allen movie. He said, You'd have to say those were comedies, too. Because it was Gordon Willis, I was going to do anything that man said, and it was incredibly limiting. There was a way in order to hit a mark for Gordon Willis that didn't have just to be accurate. It had to be precise. Gordon Willis would be looking through. He measured every shot from the length of the floor to what the actual lens was. And he would literally move his finder six inches or up or down or to the left. And there was a huge difference between each one of those positions. And I would be on my mark thinking I was on my mark. And he would be looking through it and he would say, Tom, you're not on your mark.

[01:04:59.000] - Speaker 1
And it was because my weight was on my left foot instead of my right foot. All right, you'd think, well, that's stultifying. No, it's not. It's actually liberating. Because when you get to the place where you realize it requires that amount of fidelity, that means you do a shitload of other stuff with your shoulders and your eyes and the tone of your voice and whatever you're getting from at that point. It was Sheli Long in the movie with me, and it ended up being on. And you have to go and be remolded into the type of an artist and the type of professional I have to be. Certainly by the material, it's always different. Certainly by the DP, but along with the director itself. I have worked with the same director a number of times. I've worked with Penny Marshall twice. I worked with Bob Zemeckis five times. I worked with Steven five times. I worked with Nora. I worked with Ron Howard many times. There's plenty of other people. I say, Hey, let's get back. What do you got? Let's do some more stuff. Tom Tipfer. I worked with him on Cloud Atlas and hologram for the king.

[01:06:01.740] - Speaker 1
Because once you get past the way they work and the nomenclature and the vocabulary working, you're that farther ahead down the process. You get to unleash all this other. You get to go deeper and to farther. You don't have to do just A, B, and C are actually working in other letters of the alphabet. It's incredibly liberating.

[01:06:24.160] - Speaker 2
When the camera is on you for a close-up, and it's an emotional scene, and there's no dialog and your eyes are telling the story. It feels like every movie I see of yours, that happens, where there'll be a decent length shot where we're just looking at your face, we're looking at your eyes, and we're going along with the whole story that you're telling. Are you telling the story that we're watching? Are you telling yourself something about your own life? Or what's going on in you when we're watching your eyes?

[01:06:59.690] - Speaker 1
The The insanity of all of this is that a scene like that could have been shot three weeks prior, and you're thinking about something totally different. But that size, that background is the shot that is needed for a scene that hasn't even been shot, and they put it together in edit. The fact is it works both ways. And I could walk you through any number of mine. We didn't shoot that that day. That wasn't in there. That was a completely different thing. But the other side of it, it also works when all you're doing is being in the scene, being in the story, taking it in exactly as it is playing itself out at that very, very specific moment. The thing that you learn, or I don't want to say learn because it makes it seem possible that almost anybody can do it, is the thing that you divine over time is an acceptance that it can work both ways, but that there is some difference, I think, in your own sense of authenticity when it all comes together in the scene on the day that you are shooting it. The other thing that comes along with it that you have to understand is sometimes it don't work at all.

[01:08:22.880] - Speaker 1
Sometimes you think you got it and you've nailed it, and then they put it together and it just ain't there. There's nothing you can do about It's not. But there's any number of moments where I thought, oh, this is the big closeup. This is the big banger here. I better be there for the big banger. I got to get there for this one. And there's something about the scene that doesn't land. Not necessarily anybody's fault. It's just something in the mix. It's like you're playing cards and you think, oh, my God, I've got a full house here. I've got three threes and two sevens. I'm going to win this. And And you lose because somebody else has two queens and three tents. That happens all the time. So there remains this ephemeral sense of magic and serendipity that comes into play all the time. At the same time, there are moments where you got to go there, man. And how did you do that scene where blah, blah, blah happened? I said, I'll tell you how it happened. I went there. That's what happened. And then you But you also witness other people going there as well.

[01:09:34.080] - Speaker 1
People are in the scene that you're in, and you say, undeniably, that person right there just went to a place that was so profoundly deep and spiritual. And then you see it when you end up coming, when the movie comes out, you say, Hey, I was there when they did that. And I hope, given the same circumstances, I can get there as well because I can walk you through. Look, if you make enough movies, you can just say, No, no, no. Yes, yes, yeah, yeah. Not quite, not quite. No, yes, yes, yeah. You get to do that. But I wish there was some other way around it. But oftentimes, you just have to go there.

[01:10:17.980] - Speaker 2
In terms of going there, the actor you're against goes there. Now you're responding. Is there a sense of competition position, or is there a sense of, This is really happening and I'm in it? Do you get carried away in the moment or is it something else?

[01:10:43.320] - Speaker 1
I can only respond because of the way things have been as I become more and more in tune to, I think, whatever instrument I get to bring to it. Also, the fact that I've only said yes to things that I have immediately been fascinated as soon as I read them.

[01:11:01.250] - Speaker 2
Forever or when did that start?

[01:11:03.900] - Speaker 1
Oh, no. I'm going to say that it started at some point where, number one, I felt that I needed to go farther and I didn't have to start worrying about financial aspects of it. And I realized that I didn't have to take every job, that the job to be a writer, and I think the job to be an artist, is to make a different type of judicial choice. And that honestly went to, I'm going to say, somewhere around Apollo. Sometimes Every time around working with Penny Marshall, I just on big. I just realized there's a whole type of movie that I don't want to do anymore. And not that I knew what type of movie I did want to do, but there was a type of theme. There's a type of movie that was going to examine a theme in a way that that's the type of people that I wanted to work with. And that's the type of movie that I wanted to make, even in the confines of something that are just like rip-snorting scavenger hunts like the Da Vinci Code or something like that. There's actually a logic and a theme that I got to explore even in those movies.

[01:12:01.990] - Speaker 1
But as time has gone by, I have been able to, I think, gravitate towards a different focus so that there's a ton of stuff I just don't even notice anymore. I don't see the I'm a Cruise anymore. I don't see the carnival that a movie is. I don't see the tools. I don't see the booms. I was in a movie. I was doing a thing when I made a movie called Fench with Miguel Sopocznik, me and an actor by the name of Caleb Landry Jones. And a dog. That's all that we were in. It was just the three of us in this movie. And we were shooting a very tight scene in an RV in the boom operator, the guy who had the mic because we were doing stuff with the dog or something like that. And I looked up and I saw something new for the first time in this scenario of a camera and a focus puller and boom operator. There's always a bunch of people there. And I stopped seeing them long ago. And the new thing in it was a The boom operator was wearing glasses. And I can't remember his name, but I said something like, Steve, what's with the sunglasses?

[01:13:10.660] - Speaker 1
And he said, Oh, this is because I don't want to distract you with where my eyes are. And I said, Dude, that is so caring. That is so thoughtful of you. That is magnificent. But all I can see now is a pair of sun glasses. So he took them off. But what he was doing was he realized that in tight quarters like that for other people, you might be distracted by it. And I don't see that stuff anymore. So I think over the course of the last... I'm I'm going to say 20 years of doing it. I'll say since maybe, I don't know when it's some movie this all began to kick in. Maybe when I started working with Bob Zemeckis, where it just became, Hey, man, you just got to be there. I need you to be there. I need to be my soulmate in this, and I I see what you're trying to do. I need you to just be there. And somewhere around there, I stopped seeing all that other debris that can get in the way of what you're trying to do. I don't see the lights. I don't get the sense.

[01:14:12.920] - Speaker 1
And to me, it's more so now. And it's just me and whoever I'm in the scene with, just like that. I feel lucky.

[01:14:20.180] - Speaker 2
No, it's a great skill to develop, and I imagine the only way to get that is through years and years and years and years until they disappear.

[01:14:28.120] - Speaker 1
Well, I think there are some geniuses level. I think there are people who do it quite naturally. I've never been one of them. I remember when I was auditioning for stuff and I was on unemployment, and they needed a job. I remember going into audition circumstances and thinking, just for my own benefit, I'm better than 50% of these people here. You see all these guys who are my age and my height, my color or whatever it is, I'm better than 50% of it right now. They should just leave. If there's 100 guys, 50 of you can go. Just take off right now. He'd leave. Then I would look at him and say, You know what? And there's there's 45 of you guys that I'm just as good as. So if I'm the right, if I'm louder, if I'm funnier, if I'm quiet or whatever it is, I got the same exact shot at this than you guys do. So if I get the job, tough titties, guys, I was in the right place at the right time. But then there's always four guys there that you cannot touch. They are geniuses, and they are on some other stellar plane.

[01:15:34.200] - Speaker 1
And I've worked with people that are like that. I just don't know how they do it, but they are operating on some other Formula One fuel here. And that if I watch them carefully, I can emulate them and go from emulation into imitation to actually a genuine reinterpretation of how to do this on my own. And that's also part of the grand-ass magic of doing all this. And sometimes I'm going to tell you right now, it comes out of people that why does this role have somebody this brilliant in it? Oh, I say, because he's the best person or she's the best person for what this role is. And it was meant to be. And I'm just going to watch this and carry on with it. I'm going to try to do it like these people. But it's not just an imitation. They can say, how do you get to a place where you're so comfortable in this moment? They're artists, man, and they don't need to explain it. And I don't think they probably couldn't explain it if they wanted.

[01:16:29.960] - Speaker 2
How different is performing on stage versus acting in movies?

[01:16:34.380] - Speaker 1
The great thing about performing on stage is that you get to start at the beginning every single night, and you get to ride it out to the very end. I haven't. I've recently, I was on Broadway in 2013 in a play called Lucky Guy, a fabulous ensemble directed by George Wolf. And I played Fall Staff in a great production of Henry IV, Part One and Two, with the Shakespeare Center in Los It was directed by Dan Solvay. And in both of those, there wasn't a single individual performance that was the same as the next one, because you go out at the beginning and something happens in the cookery of that audience in that night and that moment. And you can hear it. You can sense it. They're a little bit behind us. So let's lay it out a little bit more specifically. They're a little bit ahead of us, so we can pick this up. Or they are so into this. All All we have to do is be real, and they are going to get it hands down. No performance lasts the same amount of time. Nothing rides exactly, nothing lands exactly the same time.

[01:17:40.680] - Speaker 1
You can celebrate. You look at Bruce Springsteing in one of his shows, you know that everybody's going to be in their feet for a couple of those songs that he pulls out. And those exist in any Broadway, any theatrical show. You have some moments. This scenario here, this is the well-made play, so let's ride this maybe out, let's celebrate it. But then you have to go into whatever the next beat is, and it's completely different. I think it's the purest life that an actor can have. You're in charge. No one is cutting around you. It's your speed, it's your voice, and at any individual moment, it's your interpretation of what the language is. I think the thing that's more important when you're doing something on stage is that you have to be in tune with the rest of the ensemble. Every Everybody has to mesh. It has to be a beautiful orchestra, and everybody's got to come in with their line so perfect, because even if you're just playing French horns, there's a moment where the most important thing you're hearing is French horns. In the play that I did on Broadway. There was a scene between me and Peter Garretty.

[01:18:48.960] - Speaker 1
Peter Garretty is a great old actor, and he and I had done a number of things. He was in Charlie Wilson's War. We were out on stage, and we had a scene together at the end of the first act every single night for 162 performances. We were out, I'm going to say somewhere around performance 72. I heard him for the first time. I heard what he said and how he said it for the first time. The reason I heard it for the first time is because he just put some other hitch in it for that performance. It was a difference between hearing a line in a seat scene that leads to my cue and hearing an idea in a scene that was actually about two people talking to one another. And after that, it was like, Katie by the door and said, Oh, I get. Oh, I've experienced this thing now. Every night, we get to find some new thing and put it out there. My friend, Peter Scalari, we had done Buson Buddies, and we were in the show together. And every night, he had one percussive line that he said that was at the end of a thing.

[01:20:02.520] - Speaker 1
Every night, he put something else into it. And every night, he absolutely killed me. God bless him. And every night when we were done, I would come off, You son of a bitch. You son of a bitch, you got me again. We lost Peter. He passed away to cancer last October. But that's the great thing about every night. I don't like to make a lot of analogies between actors and musicians, but every show is different, man. You hit some lick differently or the crowd is not as into the surefire hit that you thought they were going to be in, but instead they take to this other B-side that you're playing, and everybody knows the lyrics to that thing. Happens all the time, and it's the great joy of performing live. I think it's the best life an actor can have. But when you got to do it six or eight times a week, man, you got to be concentrated. You got to take care of the answer.

[01:21:00.720] - Speaker 2
Considering the story you just told about the different audiences and the different reactions to essentially the same play, even though there may be slight differences, talk about the way different audiences experience the same movie.

[01:21:16.650] - Speaker 1
I think a play is something that you experience knowing that you're with a bunch of other strangers, that you are part of a group. It's palpable. There's a lobby that you go through. You find your you step over other people. A motion picture, I think at its core, is a singular experience for every different movie goal. You get into the theater anytime you want. You sit down any place you want. You will have your accouterments, your popcorn or none, your soda or none. You might read the paper before it starts. You might be with somebody. And so it's really a shared moment with you or a handful of other people. And even though you end up perhaps in a room that It might be full of strangers, chances are if the theater holds 200 folks and you're there on a Thursday night, there might be 80 people there. The first week, it might be much more of an event. Okay, that's different. But Motion pictures are a one-on-one experience between the movie and the person who is watching. You name a movie that I saw in a theater somewhere, I can tell you how old I was, what theater it was in, the circumstances around it, probably who I was with.

[01:22:31.930] - Speaker 1
But what really matters is what I got from that movie all by myself. So it's a singular interpretation of what you just saw. That doesn't mean you go out and argue about it. Sure, I do that all the time. But everything, all the connections that are happening are happening so deep inside the recesses of your own head and the connections of your own head, because you might be, I would have gone off to movies and no one... All I would think about was what would I do if I was in that circumstance? And the other person we're looking at from completely objective, this is about somebody else. It's got nothing to do with me. And I think that's the difference. Yeah, there is certainly the metrics that say, This national audience liked it. This group saw it like here. A lot of Greeks were in the audience, and so they like you because you're married to a Greek. All sorts of things come around with it. But I think if you can continuously keep breaking that down, it ends up being a solitary experience for the movie because in a lot of ways, in some ways, I'm sorry, but the best way of seeing any movie is by yourself in a screen that is the best version of the movie you ever could possibly see.

[01:23:51.610] - Speaker 1
And I think we all end up having that, singalongs and stuff like that. But when that contract that the audience has with motion picture screen itself, when it kicks in somewhere around the opening credits, I think your field of vision starts being narrow and narrow, narrow. So it's just a cone between the screen and yourself, even though you're with your family and with your kids, whatever. If it's moving and it's evolving, it's not that. I don't think it's different at all from going to a museum and standing in front of a painting that you are the only person looking at that painting, even though everybody else has looked at So that, I guess, the question is, what is the difference? Is that whatever the distance goes in between it being a group experience to being a singular experience is much faster in the cinema. It really does land in your consciousness almost in real time, so that when you're walking out of there, it's a singular opinion or a singular experience of how it touched you and what you're going to carry away when you have to be in. On that topic, do you read ever views of movies before you've seen the movies?

[01:25:02.780] - Speaker 1
I never do.

[01:25:03.680] - Speaker 2
Sometimes.

[01:25:04.370] - Speaker 1
Maybe I'll just try to get a gist of what's the Vox Populai going to be talking about here? What does it really mean? But I really only read the entire review until after I've seen the movie myself. And I'm amazed at how often I didn't get that. I didn't see it like that. That's not what I got from this experience. It's not just, is it good? Is it three stars or five stars? It's not that. It's always some other interpretation of what it meant. Maybe it's my ego, but I always think I'm more right than whoever that is. So that is brilliant. I'm the right one here. Ask me about this movie. I'll tell you what it's all about.

[01:25:42.700] - Speaker 2
What motivates you to see a movie?

[01:25:45.100] - Speaker 1
It's just natural curiosity. I'm always seeking, I think, the same thing anybody else is. I want time well spent. I want my investment in a movie to be absolutely worth it. There are a few feelings better than coming out of a movie saying, Thank God I saw that movie. Oh, my God. My life is so much... My day is better because of this, and I'll never forget where I was and what I was doing when I saw this movie. That's what you want. And on that side of it, it's awfully easy to give up on a movie now in 20 minutes or so because oftentimes, watching it at home, there's other things you can do. But when you pay in order to go to see it, you have a little bit more reason to stay. But I am always, I just want to see something I've never seen before. I want to see something brand new or new interpretation of something.

[01:26:32.030] - Speaker 2
You told a story earlier about holding the knife and the fork a certain way. I wanted to ask, after a film, has the character that you've been playing for a period of time ever changed you? Does it work its way into your personal life, or can you really leave it behind?

[01:26:49.570] - Speaker 1
No, I think as time has gone by, the investment that I think I have to put into something can, in fact. It can change my perspective. There's been a number jobs of recently that couldn't help but alter a perspective. Part of it certainly is the work experience of doing it in the first place, where you find yourself challenged in a way that you haven't been challenged. But there's also other parts of it that impact the way I looked on the world that I would not have done it had I not had the work assignment of going off and getting some version of a bachelor's degree and what the subject matter is. I don't think I fly on an airplane the same way that I did after playing knowing Chesley Sullenberger and doing Sully. I just knew all this stuff about aviation now that I never knew. Meaning, what are the pressures on these people who are doing this for a living? And what are the odds? And where has this plane been? And what maintenance has it gone through? That's one aspect of it. Something else will come about like, because I played Fred Rogers in a movie a movie about Fred Rogers, he must have been really been changed by that.

[01:28:04.270] - Speaker 1
And yeah, the stuff that I found out about Fred was absolutely fascinating. But what altered me more was the effect that Fred Rogers had on the writer who wrote the piece that the entire movie is based on. That all came about because the writer who did this cover story for Esquire, wrote a story on Fred Rogers. And this guy had become persona non grata because of the style of celebrity exposé that he had written. There were people who just said, I'd love to do a cover for Esquire, but not with that guy. And he had approached his job as being some version of a literary historian and journalist. He said, If I'm going to do these stories on somebody, I'm going to really find out what makes them tick, and I'm going to place them in the proper place in the zeitgeist. And doing that made people want to have nothing to do with him. Okay, a bit of the contract went on. But then he, almost as penance, Tom Juneau, Tom, who was around the set quite a bit. And I asked him about this specifically because I remember the pieces that he wrote that turned him into a guy who was on it on grana.

[01:29:16.800] - Speaker 1
And he said, Fred Rogers changed his life for the better by doing this celebrity profile. Now, there's a lot of reasons to admire Fred Rogers, all sorts of things about him, how kind he was, the fact that he was a reverend, that he was ordained, that his ministry was three-year-old kids who were watching television who had no idea how the world worked, who needed to learn how to communicate and deal with such things like the death of a puppy or something like that. A lot of reasons to look at Fred Rogers and just say, Man, I'd like to be more like Fred Rogers. But what Tom experienced from him was a type of renaissance of kindness and understanding that began when he wrote the article about him, but then continued on for years afterwards. Fred remained invested in Tom's life. And Tom credited, I don't want to necessarily put words into his mouth. But when he said, Fred Rogers changed my life for the better because it gave him a bigger understanding of one's place in the zeitgeist, if that makes sense. That you can actually... Anybody can impart change in this the world at certain levels.

[01:30:31.580] - Speaker 1
That's what Tom Juneau had learned from Fred Rogers. And it's like, What am I? My job is not to change the world. My job is to be a journalist and do my job, and my job is blah, blah, blah. And Fred Rogers said, Well, of course, that What's your job? But what's your place? What's the meaning of life? And it's not just be kind and be nice and blah, blah, blah, and like that. And I will say that that was part of, I think, a bit of an answer that I was that I might have been searching for because I'm not about to call myself a theologian in any way, but I remember. I saw an interview, and in the research that I was doing, he was asked, Why should anybody pray? They asked this of Fred Rogers. I will tell you that his wife and his kids said, Oh, no, Fred prayed every night. I said, What do you mean he prayed every night? He said, No, he said his prayers every night. I said, What were there? I said, Well, he would just pray for people he knew. And I said, Well, what does that mean exactly?

[01:31:37.630] - Speaker 1
And they couldn't answer my question necessarily. But you could always put it on, Well, maybe it was just a meditative place, which was, I'm thinking about so and so. He prayed for Tom. Now, he was asked, specifically, How are we supposed to pray? What is a good prayer? And he says, There's only one anybody can pray, and there's There's only one prayer to say, and it's just three words. And as soon as he said that, I started leaning forward. What are these three words, Fred? And the three words are, Thank you, God. Thank you, comma, God. And you don't even have to believe in God to see the wisdom in that or the patience or the Zen quality of that, which means, thank you for getting me through the day. Okay, thank you for the struggles you gave me. Thank you for seeing the world through somebody else's eyes. Thank you for stubborn my toe. Thank you for the time that... There's just an a lot of that because I have gone through that and I've learned more about the human condition because of that. So thank you, God. Now, I can say that I've learned all sorts of stuff about specific moments of history.

[01:32:54.390] - Speaker 1
I've learned about specific moments of the human condition. I've learned about Charlie Wilson and Jim Lovewell and plenty of other people, Ben Bradley, by talking about them all. And out of it all comes some longer-ask education of almost like the humanities. Can you ever take those classes, but we're going to study the humanities? Well, what the heck does that mean? It means how we became a little bit more enlightened than we were prior to that. I said, Oh, well, I think that's what my education I've been receiving as an actor through all of this stuff is a lesson in the humanities of making some piece between why good things happen to bad people and why bad things happen to your community.

[01:33:45.550] - Speaker 2
Specific question based on the Gordon Willis example of hitting your mark properly. Would you say since that day, you've hit your mark in the Gordon Willis way or no? Do things still that become part of your craft?

[01:34:04.190] - Speaker 1
The thing that is stuck, I'm answering yes. I'm giving you that yes. But the biggest thing that is stuck has been reading the room. I think certainly because the way I grew up, I had a self-defense mechanism of controlling the room. I made a big entrance. I would always do that because I always sweep in, do some self-defense mechanism. I'm here and I'm open and I'm loud and watch out. And who else is in here in the same position as I am? But now, I think, I'd like to think, my wife might disagree with me, is that I have intention now to come in and read the room because sometimes you do have to come in and read the room and understand, Oh, this is a Gordon Willis room. I need to be very, very specific of where I am and how I'm there, what I say and how I say it. I have to have a different presence and consistency in this room than might be called on in some other place. Some of it is business, of course. I have a company, and we talk about creative stuff all the time, and I love to hear myself talk, and I love to hear how right I am all the time.

[01:35:12.530] - Speaker 1
But if I'm reading the room properly, I understand that, Hey, there's other folks that are going to test this theory by their testing and by their whatever confrontation, be it intellectual or even humorous, this is going to be made better. I think I have learned that by having all sorts of demands put on me, certainly by material, but more specifically by the people that you actually interact with in the course of a movie that just say, I see what you're doing here, Tom, and it's not quite enough. It's good. It's not enough, though. You're actually cheating the process by being satisfied with what you've brought to this. You need to read the room just a little bit better than you are, than you have been. And I think that's come across because of the demands that I figured that their work requires of me. My place certainly on the call sheet, because if you're number one or number two on the call sheet, a lot of people are going to snap, too, when you show up, whether they should or not. But along with that comes a responsibility to have earned that place where you are up on there.

[01:36:19.380] - Speaker 1
Because listen, when you're making a movie, someone is always the big dog. If you're the big dog, you better protect everybody and make them feel safe. And you also better protect your own boundaries there. So I think I've learned over the course that my job is to be flexible. My job is to, believe it or not, there's something very specific, very concrete, I do have to show up on time. I do. You have to. And you do have to be ready. You have to know the text. You do. And you do have to have an idea that is yours and yours alone. And if you don't do all three of those things, you're going to be missing out on all sorts of opportunities. In that case, why are you doing it at all?

[01:37:05.940] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of PlayTone.

[01:37:08.060] - Speaker 1
Playtone came about because when I did Philadelphia with Jonathan Deming, he had a company called Clinic Aesthetical, and we were talking about doing some other things. I told him about this one idea I had for doing about a rock and roll band in 1964. They said, You need to work with Gary Getsman, who was the producer. Gary was the main executive producer. He wrangle all sorts of stuff for Jonathan Jimmy, and all the movies and Silence of the Lambs and all of them. And he and I started. I got together with this guy. Gary is a bit of a genius in so many ways, and he goes back in a type of... He grew up in the Valley. As a matter of fact, Gary Getsman is the basis for the character Gary Valentine in licorice pizza by Paul Thomas Anderson. He's a guy that was a bit of an entrepreneurial millionaire before he was out of high school. He knows production backwards and forth. In the course of doing a movie called That Thing You Do, he and I just started. I realized, oh, we finish each other's sentences. This guy is a genius at fixing anything.

[01:38:12.120] - Speaker 1
Gary and I were trying to go to a recording studio on Sunset Boulevard to record a jazz composition that we just titled it I Am Sparticus. And we were going in to talk with these guys who literally banged it out that very day. Gary knows everybody in the music business. And the parking lot was full. The parking lot literally said, had a sign on it that said parking lot full. And Gary said, No, just go in the exit. Just go in the exit. And before I knew it, Gary had gotten up, Hey, man, take care of this for me. We'll be right back. We're only going to be here in about an hour and a half. And for some reason, the guy took $20 and watched our car in a full parking lot. Anybody else would have said, Oh, he can't park there. Gary is not intimidated by such rules. So we We've been doing that now since 1990. Good, good, good, '95, '96. We've had Playtone, and all we do is sit around, come up with ideas that we think would make great interesting long-form stories. Tv has changed. We did Band of Brothers.

[01:39:21.330] - Speaker 1
We made the movie Castaway. We made the movie Polar Express. We made John Adams. We made the Pacific. We made Mamma Mia. It's just a production house. We don't own it. We're just guns for hire. We just come up with the ideas. He does the hard work, and I try to get involved and do quality assurance on it. I think one of the best One of the things that we've done is we did this non-conviction series for CNN that was about each of the decades, the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, in which we go back and try to break up all the tropes and find that footage that has been completely lost forgotten. Because history is a goofy thing with a lot of different interpretations of it. We just try to put it up and said, Here's what was said. Maybe this is what it means, but this is how it played out in real time on TV. And that's been very good.

[01:40:16.180] - Speaker 2
That sounds great. I've seen many of those, and I love them.

[01:40:19.420] - Speaker 1
Here's the problem with all of them. You think they're an hour long, but they're actually only 42 minutes of content because CNN plays so many commercials. It seems like it's an hour long, but we're always frustrated because there's stuff that we want to get into. And if you've got only 42 minutes, for example, we were doing something about music in the... I want to say music in the '90s, I guess. And I ran into Darius Rucker of Hoody and the Blowfish. And we had an entire... We never mentioned them. And I said, How can you do a story about music in the '90s and not talk about Hoody and the blowfish? And I said, Darius, you have to understand, there's a big difference between having 44 minutes of programming and having 42 minutes of programming. I'm sorry, man. It just didn't make the cut. No offense. He laughed.

[01:41:10.910] - Speaker 2
How did you learn to act?

[01:41:13.320] - Speaker 1
I never had a problem getting up on stage. I did it like nothing at all. I had a natural... It was fun to get up, and I knew there were people that couldn't do it, and I had no problem doing it. Learning how to act came in a number of phases. One was realizing that it was a class you could study. I didn't know that. We had a drama class in high school, and it wasn't just people wanting to be in the plays. We actually studied the plays, and we did them. Junior College, I always took a theater class or an oral interpretation class because I needed the juju, I needed the creative release. And that led into, oh, this is actually a discipline I can declare as a major. I can study theater arts, and it was stage managing and stage lighting and set construction. I loved it all. Along with it came, I thought acting was just something you did in order to blow time because it was fun. But then I saw people that were doing it pretty seriously. And I started taking it seriously enough in order to start auditioning for stuff to do in elsewhere.

[01:42:23.040] - Speaker 1
And then I came across the best thing that happened, I think, education-wise was I did a play in Sacramento for a gentleman by the name Vincent Dowling, who was the Artistic Director of an organization called the Great Lake Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. They did a full season of six plays in rotating repertory, and they needed bodies. They needed bodies to fill out the roles on the stage, spear carriers, what have you, messengers. But they also needed bodies to do the physical work of changing over the sets every night. And so he collected this coterie, this company of about 15 of us, who, by the way, most of us are still friends. We still get together. And he put it to me this way, I'd like you to come and work in our theater because I think if you wanted to, you could be an actor. But that was a decision that you'll have to make. I cannot pay you, but what I can do is give you something of infinitely more value, and that is experience working with professional actors. And he was absolutely... We ended up going and working with people who had been in the professional theater business for decades.

[01:43:34.380] - Speaker 1
There were guys that I'd seen on TV when I was a kid, Barney Cates. He'd been in an episode of combat. He'd been in the Untouchables. There were people who had been doing it, who had studied at conservatories that had hundreds, hundreds of plays on their resumes, and they were good at it. They were polished, and they were professionals. They were the ones who showed up on time, knew the lines, and had ideas in their head. I did that for three years and came out of that understanding what was required, I think, but also all that I didn't know. I came out of there, I think, with a pretty competitive edge. When I was convinced by them that there was only one place to be if you were a professional actor, which I was by that time, because I got into the union, they paid me minimum. That's when I got into the more competitive aspect. How do you get that job and that formula? If I'm better than half the people, I'm as good as 45, and the remaining four, they're just geniuses. Maybe I can get into their league or not, but I'm going to have to have a lot more of experience.

[01:44:41.450] - Speaker 1
Then just by way of being in the right place and the time with the right time, with the right goods, I'm not going to dismiss that. I think I was good at a number of things. I think I could do things that nobody else could. I think I was not intimidated by things that other people were intimidated. I got onto TV, and from that, I got into a motion picture with Ron Howard that no one else wanted to do because it was going to be like a B movie, but it ended up doing well. I ended up being invited into the grander scheme of, Oh, here's a young guy. We could put him in this movie, and I did a ton of movies because they asked me to, and I was an actor, and I learned something important from every single one of them, including what not to do. I think you go into stuff, you start assuming an awful lot. I know how to do this. No, you don't. Oh, I have this down. No, you don't. I know how to approach this. No, actually, you're lazy and you're being way too satisfied with something that you think is great.

[01:45:41.820] - Speaker 1
You learn all that stuff, and I'm still find myself being a guy like, Okay, here's it. Just the other night we were talking and said, Hey, let's try to see some classic old movie. All right, what should we see? And some titles came up and somebody said, To Catch a Thief, 1954, Grace Kelly, Cary Grant. And I said, I've never seen that movie, and everybody was agaced. I'd never seen. Yeah, I know. I'd seen Rear Window. I'd seen The Birds, I'd seen Psycho, Hadn't seen To Catch a Thief. So we watched it. If I could tell you all that I learned from the Cary Grant clinic for being a screen actor from that movie, it would take Two hours of just talking to you, Rick, right now. Wow. That-incredible. Okay, take a look at where Cary Grant was when he made that movie. He had been a huge, huge film star for almost 20 years, right? 54, I think his first I mean, I've seen his screen test from a million years ago. I think it was done in 1933 or something, and it was terrible. But this is a guy who had been a screen icon for all that time.

[01:46:56.850] - Speaker 1
But by 54, he is a seasoned veteran. He knows camera. He knows how to keep his foot on one step of the stairs just a little higher than his other to communicate something in his body language that is a combination between the ability to flee really quickly or to feign disinterest, one of those two. So I never stopped learning from something that I see, particularly when you see it for the first time, and particularly something that is supposed to be etched in stone or captured in Amber. Cary Grant is supposed to be like an old-school movie idol. It's all a bunch of old tricks, but it's not that different than hearing a really good Frank Sinatra record from 1948. Listen to the phrasing of what Sinatra is doing here. Listen to the orchestration behind what Nelson Riddel does just for Sinatra. Then you realize that, hey, man, Bach is Bach for a reason. Sinatra is Sinatra for a reason. Cary It was Cary Grant for a reason, man. So I still keep learning from Austin.

[01:48:03.840] - Speaker 2
It's funny you bring up Cary Grant because I was going to ask a question about the idea of the audience suspending their disbelief when they see you, because for 40 years, we've been seeing Tom Hanks. The example I had in my head when I thought of the question was Cary Grant. When I see Cary Grant in a movie, I can't help but think it's Cary Grant, and it doesn't take away from my entertainment. Yet, Yet, that's Cary Grant.

[01:48:33.410] - Speaker 1
He just did something brand new. The truth is, and I think a lot of... I've had to make my piece with this, and I think you have to acknowledge this because it now comes off every single first paragraph of any review of a movie talks about every other movie everybody has made that's in our countenance, my countenance of all the movies that I've done come along with whatever new movie that you're seeing. That's just the truth, and it's righteously so. It's like when you read the later stories of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur, Cohn and Doyle, you were impacted by all the other ones that you read. It doesn't mean you ain't digging it. Out of the world of the day, are we going to say, I saw Adele in Vegas, and I think everybody knows every song that Adele has ever recorded, and yet that experience was brand new, and it was still Adele. Absolutely. Absolutely. And she was doing stuff in there that was undeniably brand new and fresh. And I know all of the Dell stuff. So going into a motion picture, I mean, look, this is the case with anybody that's great.

[01:49:41.120] - Speaker 1
It's the case with Scarlett Johansson. It's the case with Robert De Niro. It's the case with Denzel Washington. It's the case with me. Everything we've ever done is wrapped up and is part of the brand new movie that we are seeing. But out of that comes whatever else is taken through the sifter. There's other shit that comes out inside there. And you know what? If you're doing it right, if you're on top of the game, if you said yes for the right reasons, and if everybody has agreed upon the theme and the movie that you're making, and you're being tested by every single person that is part of the collaborative process there. New stuff is going to come out. The only thing that happens then is more items are added to the countenance that you bring to it in the first place.

[01:50:29.290] - Speaker 2
It's beautiful.

[01:50:31.190] - Speaker 1
And, oh, man, that's the challenge that makes me go home at night and look at myself in the mirror and say, did I get there today? Did we land on this at all?

[01:50:42.720] - Speaker 2
The bar is high.

[01:50:43.790] - Speaker 1
The bar is high, and it's a little more about. But here's the other thing that you have to say. And this is the thing that Joe DiMaggio once said. There's a really great book about Joe DiMaggio recently. Joe DiMaggio told himself all through his career, particularly when he was a great Joe DiMaggio in the Yankees, he always thought, I have to play my best and I have to be perfect because someone might be here seeing me play for the very first time. And that's the truth with any movie. I can come across kids, somebody who is 13 or 14, and they will say, When I saw you in Bridge of Spies, it made me want to be coming. It's these movies that are much later on because all the other stuff is accouterments, accouterments, legacy things. But it goes back to, I think that thing is every movie is a one-on-one experience, and someone is seeing your new movie, and they are seeing you for the very first time, even if it's a vision of yourself that they're seeing for the very first time. Can't deny that. That's the power of what it is. Somewhere, somebody is putting on Street fight and Man by the Rolling Stones, and they're hearing it for the first time, or maybe they're cognizant of it for the very first time.

[01:52:05.890] - Speaker 1
Can't deny that. And that's why art remains this timeless thing. Someone is putting on for the first time, and they're hearing that for the first time. Hey, man, I heard this really great record. What was it by? Some Russian guy named, I don't know what it is. Paula Betsey in Dance number 3 or something. I want to hear that again.

[01:52:27.320] - Speaker 2
Last question. Do you ever get nervous Yeah, always.

[01:52:32.590] - Speaker 1
You got to have that zet. What I will have, I will say, I do have faith that I've gotten over that nervousness before, and I will do so again. Some of it, of course... Look, there's a thing that happens on movies where you are petrified for the first three days of making the movie. Petrified. Horrible.

[01:52:54.470] - Speaker 2
Because you don't know what it's going to be. You don't know how it's going to go.

[01:52:57.550] - Speaker 1
I have no idea. I made this movie called Road to mission with Paul Newman. Paul Newman. Wow. The first day of shooting was a huge party scene, in which I didn't have really anything that was expected of me, but Paul had to get up and give a toast in character. And it's the first day of shooting. A ton of people are in there making their first movie ever. A ton of people are in there making the first movie with Paul Newman. A ton of people are in a room with Paul Newman for the first time. And talk about accountants that carries with it, right? Paul gets up, and the time comes for him to shoot his given a toast. He says, Maybe if the devil not learned we're dead until half an hour, he said some old Irish toast. And everybody was looking at. And when he was done with his lines, he just looked at us all and said, Always feel self-conscious on the first day, doesn't it? And everybody just let me. That's amazing. Everybody just Let go. And it was the same thing. Always feel self-conscious on the first day. There hasn't been a time that I haven't gone out on stage in which there isn't some either nanosecond or seven seconds of, What is my first line?

[01:54:14.050] - Speaker 1
What is my first line? What is the first line I say? What is my... Then you go out and you say the first two words of it, and then the rest of it is Claire saying. You got to have faith, man. You got to have faith. You got to get there. Beautiful.

[01:54:28.050] - Speaker 2
Thank you, sir. A pleasure speaking I love talking to you.

[01:54:32.220] - Speaker 1
Same. I got some questions for you. I'm going to start a podcast and you'll be my third guest.

[01:54:36.840] - Speaker 2
I'm ready when you're ready.

[01:54:38.200] - Speaker 1
All right. Great talking to you, Rick.
