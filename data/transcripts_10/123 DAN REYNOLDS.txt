[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammaton.

[00:00:14.220] - Speaker 3
I really, genuinely have never experienced writer's block.

[00:00:27.700] - Speaker 2
I don't know that feeling. I don't say that in a way of like, Ha ha, look at me. It's more just like there's infinite sounds, and they're always interesting to me. If you don't like one, well, there's another thing. I do experience writer's block if I'm not healthy. If I'm not living sober, I get less inspired to create. That's the first thing I find, if I'm drinking or if I'm in a not good head space.

[00:00:54.540] - Speaker 1
How often have you not lived sober? I think of you as a pretty sober individual. Yeah.

[00:01:00.360] - Speaker 2
I think that I'm so promoted as those values, and I love that, and that is a big part of my life, and I try to live sober all the time, so I think that is part of my life. But I would say in the last 10 years, I've been more not sober than sober for whatever that means.

[00:01:16.810] - Speaker 1
Is that usually as a form of celebration or as a form of escape?

[00:01:22.540] - Speaker 2
No, not celebration. If it was a celebration, then I would not even say the word sober, because I think that that's great. I think if with your friends and it's like, for me, that isn't why I ever turn to any substance. For me, it's always escapism. That's where I'm like, Okay, this isn't healthy.

[00:01:41.120] - Speaker 1
The way you describe music, music is your healthy escape. Yes. Because that's when you can get away from your thoughts.

[00:01:48.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it is. That's why I started writing when I was 12, because my thoughts at 12, I had a horrible spiritual crisis. Because I was raised with all the answers of religion, Then the second I started to get into my 12, 13, I was like, I had Google. Then I'm like, googling things and doing your own searching process and feeling like, oh, maybe all the answers that I have are not correct. That made me spiral. Then I really didn't like to be in my mind. I also didn't… I loved my home. My home life was great, but there was something about it that was so conflicting for me because everything revolved around this.

[00:02:29.440] - Speaker 1
You were into a spiritual community?

[00:02:33.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I was born into a really religious woman home, eight boys and one girl. My mom and dad and all of them are Roman. Romanism is a really beautiful lifestyle. It's very clean, it's very disciplined, very structured, and happy because it has so many great values to it, and it works for a lot of people. It works for my whole family. But it just never really sat with me good.

[00:02:57.900] - Speaker 1
Who do you think you would be if you weren't born into that situation?

[00:03:04.240] - Speaker 2
I would like to hope that I would have arrived somewhere where I am today. I'm really happy with where I'm at in life right now. I'm really genuinely happy with it. I don't have regrets about it. But my honest thought, I think I could be self-destructive a little bit, but that might be a product of my life. Really, actually, you know what? I don't know. My honest answer to that is I really don't know.

[00:03:29.460] - Speaker 1
Do you feel you got any good things from that upbringing?

[00:03:33.540] - Speaker 2
So much. I wouldn't have this career if it wasn't for that. I really believe that because I became obsessed about going to that place and writing a song, I became so obsessed about that because I was running away from something. I think if I didn't have anything to run away from, I would have just not run to that. It was a hard thing to run to. My I did not grow up in a family of artistry. Artistry was not seen as a career. There's academia, and that's everything. Artistry is a hobby. It's not something you could say, I'm going to… That's going to be my career. It was doctors, lawyers. My brothers are anesthesiologist, plastic surgeon, dentist, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, lawyer. It's all in you. It's all in you. In me. And you. Yeah. I knew at a young age, I did not want to do any of those things.

[00:04:29.460] - Speaker 1
How do How does your siblings feel about what you do?

[00:04:32.400] - Speaker 2
They're all super supportive. One of my brothers is my manager now, and he was from the very beginning, one of the attorneys. Then the other attorney is my lawyer. I work with two of them. They're all very, very supportive. I know that my mom worries about me a lot, and I understand it now. I have four kids, so I understand the worry. But she also just believes completely with all of her that her path is the path, that her religious path, if you don't take it, you will not have an eternal happiness. Really believes it, doesn't think it. No. Wholeheartedly She lives it.

[00:05:15.160] - Speaker 1
She lives it. I imagine if she lives it, she experiences it.

[00:05:18.940] - Speaker 2
Yes. So does my dad. I think that they worry about me in that sense, but no spewing, never like, You're going to hell. It's not like that. If it was that, that'd actually be easy for me because then I'd go, Okay, cut off. But it's not that. It's more sadness maybe or something, and that's harder.

[00:05:43.600] - Speaker 1
Is there a part of your parents being proud for what you're doing?

[00:05:47.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah, definitely proud. They come to so many of the shows. They get emotional all the time with them in a really beautiful way. My mom has said to me many times, Maybe this is what God was How did you do. It's interesting because in the Mormon religion, there's one really cool part of it, which I love, like sci-fi, and I love fantasy. Me setting it up like that, it sounds like me setting it up, I I'm locking it, but I'm not. I just like things that are curious. When you're a teenager in the Mormon religion, you get a thing called a patriarchal blessing, and it's the closest to magic in Romanism. There's a lot of things about Romanism that are magic and cool and interesting. But this one was really interesting. You meet with this patriarch who was a wise, mysterious figure, and they give you a blessing. They lay their hands on your head.

[00:06:40.800] - Speaker 1
It's a human patriarch.

[00:06:41.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah, sorry. It's a human.

[00:06:43.120] - Speaker 1
Checking because you said sci-fi.

[00:06:45.030] - Speaker 2
Right, sorry. Yes.

[00:06:46.640] - Speaker 1
Tell me about your patriarch. Describe him.

[00:06:49.670] - Speaker 2
Okay. He was in a wheelchair. He was very old, very skinny, very quiet, very reverent. Ask me a couple questions about morality, maybe at the time. It wasn't anything about getting to know me. Nothing. Are you living by the Commandments of God? Are you morally clean?

[00:07:15.200] - Speaker 1
How old are you at this time?

[00:07:16.140] - Speaker 2
I was 14.

[00:07:17.960] - Speaker 1
Is that the age everyone does it?

[00:07:20.880] - Speaker 2
You're supposed to be really clean at the time. I remember lying a little bit when I did it because, first of all, you're not supposed to masturbate or look at pornography. I remember being at that age and I was like, I'm not going to tell this man that because he was asking me. But I still got the blessing. He told me in it, it's like they tell you a bit about your future. You're going to go on to do this and that. You're going to have kids, and you're going to go on a mission and do this. Two of the things, and it's supposed to be really sacred, you're actually not supposed to talk about it, but I think as I've gotten older, I feel comfortable with it. Okay. Two of the things- Whatever the line is that you feel comfortable with go to and don't go past it. Okay, thanks, Rick. Two of the things, one of which was to say, your voice will move lots of people. I was 14, and my mom afterward was teary-eyed, and she said, I've been there for all your brothers and their patriarchal blessings, and I never heard anything specific like that.

[00:08:20.240] - Speaker 2
What do you think that meant? I remember thinking, I have no idea what that meant.

[00:08:23.520] - Speaker 1
So your parents are in the room or your mom is in the room?

[00:08:25.660] - Speaker 2
My mom and my dad were in the room for it. That's always the case. Always the case. Nobody else is allowed. And you're not supposed to talk about it. You're not even supposed to... Then you're given the sacred- Even with the family or you can talk- Even with the family. I think they say when you get married, maybe in a very sacred setting with your spouse or significant other, you can share some of it. It said that, it also said that I would have power to control the elements.

[00:08:50.030] - Speaker 1
I'll never forget. Wow, that's pretty good.

[00:08:51.800] - Speaker 2
That was cool. When we first were playing shows, we'd play festivals, and I always felt like the sun would come out when we go on stage. Even when I was losing my faith, I was like, you know. But then we've had a lot of thunderstorms lately, so I'm not exactly sure what that means.

[00:09:06.100] - Speaker 1
That sounds amazing. You never discussed it with any of your siblings, their experience like that?

[00:09:13.000] - Speaker 2
Never. No. There's a lot There are things in the Roman Church that are secretive. Sounds like a bad word, but sacred is the way it's said. For instance, when you go to the temple, you're given a sacred name that's unique to you, that's different than your name, and you're not allowed to tell anybody.

[00:09:30.000] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:09:31.400] - Speaker 2
Kind of cool. Yeah.

[00:09:32.380] - Speaker 1
He just knows it besides you.

[00:09:34.340] - Speaker 2
My ex-wife, I told her it, because you're allowed to share it with, again, once you get married. I like those kinds of things.

[00:09:42.950] - Speaker 1
Yeah, well, they have great power. I learned TM when I was 14, and you're given a mantra, which is just for you, from that time, in that first time you learn it, you never speak it again. It's part of its power is that it's sacred and it's yours and it's not to be shared.

[00:10:04.740] - Speaker 2
That's one of the reasons with the band that… It's an anagram. The band name was you switched the letters and it made a different phrase. Then we agreed, we made a pact as a band, we'll never reveal that. That's between us. Then we switched up the words and we made a bunch of different phrases. We came up with Imagine Dragons because it was just weird. I was like, Okay, we'll own that on Google.

[00:10:31.660] - Speaker 1
But it's an anagram of a sacred phrase for your band. Yes.

[00:10:35.090] - Speaker 2
We kept that a secret. And you created it yourself. Yes. I wrote it on a piece of paper in biology my sophomore year at BIO when I was going to drop out.

[00:10:43.940] - Speaker 1
How old were you at that time?

[00:10:45.820] - Speaker 2
21. There was a battle of the bands, and I was like, Okay, this is my opportunity to start a band. Obviously, I did not know they would do anything it did.

[00:10:57.480] - Speaker 1
Did you have another career path in mind? What were you going to do?

[00:11:00.900] - Speaker 2
I wanted to be an FBI agent. Cool. Yeah. They came to BIO. They love to hire Mormons because Mormons are very strict, no drugs, God-fearing, so you're afraid of lying. Maybe you're going to go to hell. They had come to the school and I attended a seminar. I just more thought... I liked the idea of a dangerous life because my life was so the opposite of that growing up.

[00:11:27.520] - Speaker 1
That's interesting.

[00:11:28.180] - Speaker 2
I also, in seeking a relationship, it was the same. I looked for something dangerous that was as opposite for me as I could find because I like to learn. I love meeting people who are fascinating and different than me and understanding them.

[00:11:44.960] - Speaker 1
That's how we grow.

[00:11:45.900] - Speaker 2
Yeah. That's my favorite part of life is meeting strangers and having dialog and getting to know them.

[00:11:53.680] - Speaker 1
In mormonism, is there a two-year mission that you go on? Yeah. Did you get to do that?

[00:11:58.320] - Speaker 2
I did. I went on a two-year mission when I turned 19, and you have to be deemed worthy to do it. So I did in leading up to that. I had no sex, no drugs, no anything. It's a really, really serious thing. If you do it, even during that two-year period, they'll send you home dishonorably. All the Roman culture finds out about it and you're seeing. Or if you just are sad and you want to go home, your scene is weak. All my brothers take on.

[00:12:27.660] - Speaker 1
Does that go for life or no? Are they treated poorly forever or it's just for a window?

[00:12:33.240] - Speaker 2
It's a scar that is with them forever. I have friends who were with me. They got sent home because they had sex with a girl on a mission, which you can't do, or because they were going to clubs at night and got caught, got sent home, or because they just were depressed. A mission, every day, you wake up at 6: 00, you work out for a half hour, you study the Bible and the Book of Norman for an hour on your own, I believe, and then it It was a half hour with your companions. You're put with one person. You have to be within earshot eyesight at all times, except when you use the bathroom. No phones.

[00:13:09.440] - Speaker 1
And they were on a mission as well? They were on a mission as well. Is it someone you know in advance or no? No.

[00:13:13.560] - Speaker 2
You're paired with someone you know. That day you arrive, here it is. You're together now for 3-6 months. You can call home twice a year, Mother's Day, Christmas. That's it. Wow. No flirting. No communication. You could write a handwritten letter once a week. You have a day that's called preparation day where you your laundry. You can play basketball with the locals or with your companion or something for half the day, and you can write a letter home. I would write home every week.

[00:13:39.950] - Speaker 1
You can talk to anyone. In general, you can talk to people.

[00:13:42.910] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's what you do all day. Just talk to people. After we do the hour of study together, we have breakfast, then all day, you map out the entire city you're in, and you go one street at a time, knock every door. Check it off. Knock the next door. Hello, I'm a missionary. I'm Eric from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints. My name is Alder Reynolds, and I'm here to share a message with you about Jesus Christ. Have you ever wondered why you're here and where you're going? And something like that.

[00:14:10.810] - Speaker 1
What type of responses do you get?

[00:14:13.760] - Speaker 2
In the beginning, you get Basically, every door shut because you're nervous, because you don't know any way to connect with people. Then you learn, just like any salesman or person would learn how to interact. You learn how to do the... Not not to just do that rote thing. Instead, look at someone, talk to them, ask them a question about themselves, point at something in their house, ask them about it. People like to talk about themselves. You as quick as you can get them to tell you something about themselves. You learn these things, and then you can start to get in more doors. Then as you have more success, there's this pyramid of leadership. There's 200 missionaries, for instance, in the state of Nebraska, which is where I called to serve. They pray about it, like the prophet pray about it. Supposedly, every single person says, Where should Dan Reynolds go? Nebraska. Apparently, that's how it went.

[00:15:10.530] - Speaker 1
You had never been to Nebraska before?

[00:15:12.060] - Speaker 2
No. I was hoping for somewhere different. My brothers went to England, the Philippines. I was like, I'm going to go learn Tagalog in the Philippines. Yes. I'm down. Yeah.

[00:15:20.760] - Speaker 1
Nebraska.

[00:15:21.720] - Speaker 2
I was very sad about that. You read it out loud in front of your whole family and you get it. It's a bit, Everybody come together for dinner. Here we go. Here's the piece of paper. You're called to serve for the next two years in Nebraska. All your brothers were like, Oof. Sorry, man.

[00:15:36.960] - Speaker 1
Did you feel a sense of rejection when people would close the door in the beginning?

[00:15:42.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure. I already went into it not knowing if it was true. I was already conflicted about it since I was 12. Then you're telling people it's true all day, which makes you think it's more true because you're saying it's true all day. As you repeat that mantra, it becomes part of you. Do you know this is true? Of course, I know it's true. Why do you know it's true? Well, I can't really make it, logically makes sense, but I can tell you when I practice these things, it makes my life better. I'm a bad liar. I would tell them the things that I could find were true. Look, when I'm not drinking and smoking, I'm healthier. When I'm not having premarital sex, I'm not getting anyone pregnant. I'm looking for where can you tell the truth? Then you just do that every day. Then your goal is to baptize as many people as possible to bring them under... Did you baptize any? I did. I baptized a lot of people. Really? Yeah, I got good at it. I got good at knocking on doors and becoming friends with people. Then you meet some people who are just like, Sure, why not?

[00:16:45.240] - Speaker 2
They're like, Cool. I feel like if a Roman knocked on my door and they were interesting enough and I enjoyed the conversation, you want to tuck me in the water? Yes. I would put my right-hand to the square, I would baptize them. You go into a big hot tub type thing in the Roman Church.

[00:17:02.300] - Speaker 1
You would do the baptism of them?

[00:17:04.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you dress up in all white. They dress up in white, and then you put your hand like this, you do this. I, Dan Reynolds, having been commissioned in Jesus Christ, baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. You help them plug their nose, and you put them all the way underwater. Even if a toe comes out of the water, you have to repeat it. Everything has to have full emersion. If it's emerge. Yeah, complete.

[00:17:25.060] - Speaker 1
When were you baptized into it?

[00:17:26.760] - Speaker 2
At eight. At eight. That is the earliest you can be baptized because that at that age, you have enough rational thinking that you know right from wrong. Now you're held accountable for your words and deeds and actions. Who baptized you? My dad. Only men because it's the priesthood is what it's called. You have to have the keys and authority that is given to you by someone else who had it. Once you turn of age, then they give you this blessing. Now you have the keys to baptize.

[00:17:54.880] - Speaker 1
Did your dad do that for all of your brothers?

[00:17:57.200] - Speaker 2
His dad gave it to him. It all goes back to Joseph Smith in the 1800s. Wow.

[00:18:03.080] - Speaker 1
It's radical.

[00:18:05.280] - Speaker 2
It is. It's a cool story. I find it beautiful. Yeah, I do, too. Especially as I get older and I realize how unique it is. Because when you're going through, I just thought everybody, I really did. I just lived in a circle where everybody was Roman in Las Vegas. I had a lot of friends that were not Roman, and I just thought, well, even though I didn't know it was true, I just thought, they'll come into the fold. Of course, this is the truth.

[00:18:31.860] - Speaker 1
How did Romans look at other Christians, let's say?

[00:18:36.140] - Speaker 2
Again, I'm trying to be really respectful, but I also want to give you honest answers. I can speak from my truth. Yes. Even when my faith was weak and I was still Roman, I still saw other Christians as lacking the keys and authority. That made my life so much more difficult to receive advice. Because I remember having friends, and I'd be like, What do you think I should do? Normal discourse you have with your friends. They would tell me something, and I would think, Did this come from God or not? It probably didn't come from God because they don't have the keys and the authority. Whereas maybe some Roman person that I was like, They're really living clean. When they talk to me, I'm like, That's an answer to that prayer I was had. Because you pray every night. God, help me to know, blah, blah, blah. I felt like I never heard anything, nothing supernatural. Then you're taught, Well, your answers can come through other people. Then I'm looking to find my answers not in my gut. I didn't learn to know my gut until I got older, which was really a difficult thing for me to find.

[00:19:44.540] - Speaker 2
I was looking for answers through God, from mom, dad, friend who's Roman, all Roman.

[00:19:53.360] - Speaker 1
So your relationship to music was the thing outside of that?

[00:19:58.840] - Speaker 2
Yes, it was, now I can say my doubts in this journal. Let me put it in enough metaphors that even if my family hears it, they won't know. But my dad knew. I didn't play any of my music for a while for them because I knew they would listen and think, Oh, he's doubting his faith. I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to talk about it. But eventually, I showed it to my dad, and he never asked me about the lyrics. That felt good. He He just said, This is great. This is really great. Supportive. Yeah, very supportive. He was really my guide to music. He was always listening to cool things. He was always listening to Harry Nelson or Bob Dylan or Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, a lot of singer-songwriters. Then my brothers were listening to grunge, so there was a lot of nirvana and Pearl Jam. Then I was really into hip hop. Between those three different things, that was what I grew up on. It was like singer-songwriters, hip hop, grunge.

[00:20:59.760] - Speaker 1
You also, I imagine, went to the tabernacle and heard the choir.

[00:21:04.220] - Speaker 2
I sang in church every Sunday, and everybody either sing the triple or the soprano. My dad would do the parts, and we would open the hymn books, and I'd watch my dad follow the... Really good melodies, actually. A lot of gospel music has incredible melody writing, especially, their hymn book has a lot of the gospel standards, too, which are fantastic. The Roman songs themselves are maybe not as good. Also, when you're on a, side note, but when you're on a mission, every Sunday, you can go to any church. I would go to every different church every Sunday just for fun. The Baptist Church, for instance, had the best music and the best vibe. Then you go to maybe the hardest church for me as far as the music went was Jehovah's Witness.

[00:21:56.680] - Speaker 1
It was really bad music. What's the music in Jehovah's Witness?

[00:21:58.900] - Speaker 2
It was similar, but it was just really bad. It was like you're in a very square, small room, and the music was... It just wasn't the center of bringing the emotion. Where some churches, it's like the Baptist Church, it's like, this is what ignites the spirit in the room is how great this music is, and everybody feels it and gets behind it and you're like, is this God I'm feeling or is this music just really fucking great? Yeah. Mormonism just took from everything. I was raised on a lot of gospel, and that's all you get to listen to on your mission. Every Every day I listen to Morgan Tabernacle Choir. I wasn't allowed to listen to anything else.

[00:22:34.200] - Speaker 1
They can sing.

[00:22:34.960] - Speaker 2
I could sneak it, but if you sneak it, then you have, usually you'll have your guy rat you out, and then you get in trouble. Unless you have a really cool companion. But most of the time, They take someone who's going to be more naughty and put them with somebody who's more square, and they have a way to doing it.

[00:22:52.480] - Speaker 1
Did you have a good relationship with your partner?

[00:22:54.880] - Speaker 2
I loved every one of them. Great. Almost every three months, I had someone new, and I was in a two-year time period.

[00:23:00.530] - Speaker 1
That's always how it works?

[00:23:01.620] - Speaker 2
Typically. If they get along really bad or something, maybe a month and a half, but at least a month and a half, unless they get in a fistfight and there's an emergency transfer.

[00:23:10.720] - Speaker 1
But typically three months.

[00:23:12.620] - Speaker 2
Typically three months, which is two transfers. As they call it. Even the guys that I hated to begin with, I ended up loving because there was always something to love. It was a great lesson for me. I remember I had one in particular who was so difficult for me. He wouldn't shower, he wouldn't brush his teeth. We had a week together. You live off $10,000 for two years that you saved up and paid for out of your own pocket.

[00:23:41.330] - Speaker 1
$10,000 in two years?

[00:23:42.640] - Speaker 2
For two years, and that's your food and your room and where to stay.

[00:23:45.520] - Speaker 1
Do they tell you where to stay?

[00:23:46.240] - Speaker 2
You have set places that match that amount of money so that you can do it. It's pretty much all government housing. I was in projects for almost my entire mission. I saved up by working as a janitor growing up. From the beginning of high school, saved up $10,000. Then you use that to live off. That's your food, too. $10,000 for two years for your food. You can do the math. You live off ramen and white bread. I would get two pieces of white bread. I'd put ramen in the middle, crunch it up, and that's what I would eat Almost every meal. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and then those big cereal bags. But I loved it. Going back to that companion, after a week, I finally learned to say to him, Hey, man, you need to brush your teeth. You got to have good hygiene. Really? Why? Because your breath is bad. Nobody has told him this in that way. You end up having hard conversations and getting rejected all day. You spit on, you get sucker-punched I got slurpies thrown at me. Oh, yeah. When you're the more of a missionary boys with the ties and-You're wearing a suit and tie?

[00:24:51.470] - Speaker 2
You have to every day. You're walking the streets. You're just a target for every rich kid. It I was rich kids. I never was fucked with by... Especially when I was in... The most low income areas were the safest places to be because everyone fears Jesus. Everybody's like, You don't mess with the Jesus people. You could fuck with anybody, but you don't mess with Jesus people. Except rich kids, and that was scary. You would group of them, throw things, throw rocks at you, punch you. Just no regard for… You were just a target. You were a target.

[00:25:31.290] - Speaker 1
Wow. That's crazy. What a life. It's amazing.

[00:25:35.830] - Speaker 2
But that's going back to, I guess, your original question was, if I didn't have all of that…

[00:25:40.870] - Speaker 1
It has to form who you are.

[00:25:42.370] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:25:42.800] - Speaker 1
Has to.

[00:25:43.680] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it did. It drove me to music. I will tell you something. When I was still praying, I pray, but I pray a lot different now, and I'm not praying to somebody. I'm praying to everything or something. But at the time, when I was on my mission, I would pray every night. In my prayer. It's always different. You don't do repetitive praying as normands. But I would say, Please help me to find truth in this. First of all, please. I know you're not supposed to ask for a sign. I'm not going to ask for a sign, but please just help me to find this to be true because my life would be so much better if I believed all my family belief. But also, please let me do music as a career. I prayed for it every night on my mission. Wow. Every night, every time. I know I'll be able to handle it.

[00:26:28.900] - Speaker 1
You thought you were going to have a straight job. You were preparing to have a straight job. I was preparing to have a straight job, and it was a pipe dream. But your dream was to have a musical life.

[00:26:38.990] - Speaker 2
It was my dream. My brother had told me before my mission, he said, Dan, your mission is going to be the hardest thing you ever do. But because I did my mission, I got such a hot wife.

[00:26:49.930] - Speaker 1
He said that? Yeah. Amazing.

[00:26:53.380] - Speaker 2
I always remembered it. On the hardest days, I was like, I'm going to have some blessings, something Nothing good is going to come from this. My hot life was, Please let me have a career in music. That's all I want. The worst mistake I made was telling that to my mom because she holds that over my head all the time. Well, God gave you what you wanted, then you turned your back on him. I'm like, Mom, I didn't turn my back on God. It just looks a little different.

[00:27:19.260] - Speaker 1
Would you say you still have a connection to something, a higher power, let's say?

[00:27:24.760] - Speaker 2
Before every show, I always connect to I don't know what I'd call it, but I feel like it's something, something grand. I feel like God for me is happiness. It feels like something. I wouldn't say it's someone, but it feels like something. Maybe it's everything, all of it. I can't personify it, but I feel like I'm connecting with something that is yet to be known.

[00:27:52.980] - Speaker 1
Would you say it's energetic?

[00:27:56.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Maybe it's in my head, but I feel when I connect to it, then my show is great. That's why I do it, especially before shows, because I feel that if it centers me and I acknowledge my intention to the universe, my intention is to make these people happy. My intention is to make myself happy, to feel love, to facilitate love, and to just have fun and sing. Then I'm trying to just rid myself of any energy on me that just feels that it doesn't match that. Anything of my ego, any hard conversation that I've had with someone, I'm trying to just shed it off of me, and I almost feel like I see it go… I just feel connected in a magical way. Then when I really am able to do that, then it's a great show. Then I believe in it. I believe in whatever that is. I don't know. It works. Yeah. But that's different than when I was Norman, it's Dear heavenly Father. It's your father. I pictured a man in a white robe with a beard. The thing that you're taught as a Christian is it looks like this. Then, Normands believe there's the Father and then Jesus Christ, and they're two separate beings, and Jesus is the Son of God.

[00:29:06.580] - Speaker 2
Then there's the Holy spirit, which is this spirity ghost guy. That's what Normands believe. Whereas in other faiths, They believe that the three are one. It's not that way. Mormons believe it is actually a person that's up there pulling the strings. That's a cool story. I liked it, and it was fun. Maybe it's true. I don't know. The last thing I claimed to know is What's right and wrong or true.

[00:29:32.020] - Speaker 1
The fact that you can connect to something and it works for you is a great blessing, whatever it is. Yes.

[00:29:41.720] - Speaker 2
My greatest thing that I've been working on is trying to just listen to my gut. I've had to relearn that because of how I had formulated my sense. But now what feels good.

[00:29:57.340] - Speaker 1
You wrote your first song when you were 13. When did that start a cascade of songs right away? When did that start?

[00:30:04.620] - Speaker 2
Once I wrote the first song, it was like an addiction. I wrote The Next Day, and The Next Day, and The Next Day. I have all these songs. It's thousands and thousands of songs. I'm sure that A clinician of some sort would say, This is this thing. Obsessive compulsive. Yeah, obsessive compulsive. I've met with therapists throughout the years, and I've been told I have severe ADHD, and I have severe depressive disorder. But I've never done medication, not that I'm against it. I'm too fearful of it. I'm too fearful of change. I can operate here, and it's got me here. Yeah, and it's working. And it's working. I found things that helped me to manage, like I said, sobriety and things that really helped me.

[00:30:46.120] - Speaker 1
I remember when you guys reached out about us working together, and I said, Send me some songs you wrote, and you sent me, I think, 93 songs, which is very unusual. Typically, five or six songs is what someone has when they're preparing to make their next album, not in the '90s. Then when I didn't question it, I think I got another 20 after that.

[00:31:16.920] - Speaker 2
It was like, Oh, he's-I had narrowed down to that because I was like, I don't want to think I'm weird.

[00:31:20.160] - Speaker 1
He listened to 93, so what's the number? Maybe even 25 or '30. A lot. The fact that you have this practice of writing, and you say typically a song a day? Is that average?

[00:31:31.760] - Speaker 2
If I'm in a healthy spot, I'm writing every day. Sometimes I'll go through a full month and I won't write a single song. But if I were to average my life since 13, I'd probably say I write a song once every three days or something like that. It's probably something like that. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot.

[00:31:48.860] - Speaker 1
Would you say your connection to music has changed since you were 13 to now? Is it any different or is it the same?

[00:31:56.760] - Speaker 2
It's pretty similar. Yeah, it's It's a certain feeling that I love, which is there's nothing. Let me create something and let me listen to it and see how that feels. How that feels good. Let me share that with someone. Did it make them feel something? Wow, what a magical thing. That interaction of nothing to something to sharing, I love. It's just the majority of these songs were never heard by anybody except at least one person. I always share it with my dad or my brother. They might just go, Cool, or, I didn't like that one that much. My dad sometimes will say, You sound angry, and I don't really like angry music. It doesn't matter what the response is. It's about sharing it. It doesn't matter what the response is.

[00:32:49.620] - Speaker 1
You're doing self-expression. You're finding these things, and through sharing them, you're saying, This is who I am.

[00:33:00.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:33:01.000] - Speaker 1
That's what it is.

[00:33:02.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It feels great when it does give someone a good feeling. Absolutely. Or a connected feeling. You never know. You never know.

[00:33:10.290] - Speaker 1
You do it often enough where if someone doesn't like a song, it's no big deal because tomorrow there's going to be another one.

[00:33:16.070] - Speaker 2
Exactly. That's a great point. I've never really thought about that. I think that has given me a lot of armor. Yeah. It's doing so much. You're free. Yeah, you're free. Nothing is precious to me. Nothing is precious. The experience of it is precious. But whether it's received or not, I think, especially as I've gotten older, has become non-precious to me. That's great. Of course, I always hope, but that's not the reasoning.

[00:33:43.820] - Speaker 1
No, it's secondary. Yes. Yeah, the primary thing is to make it and to feel it and for you to feel it and then share it. Yes. Whatever happens after that, out of all of our control. Yes. You said there was a battle of the bands. Did the band already exist?

[00:33:59.580] - Speaker 2
No. There was a battle of the bands. I saw a poster for it. I that day went to lunch, and I was in the cafeteria at BYU. I was sitting next to a couple, a guy and a girl, who looked different than everyone else in the cafeteria. They were very non-Mormon-looking. I was at BY, which was all-Mormon. Again, I'm always gravitating towards whatever looks the most different than me. It's interesting to me. He just had an energy. His name was Andrew. I sat at the table next to Andrew I said, Hey, I don't know what my first sentence is, but something like, Do you play music or something? Are you an artist? Yeah, I am. When you're good about this battle of bands? Yeah. Should we jam out some time or something? He said, Well, yeah, this is my cousin Aurora. The three of us went back to their house that day, sat down and started writing. At the time, it was very folky and theatrical, I think, is the way I'd explain it. That would be the reference.

[00:34:56.430] - Speaker 1
If you say, Name some artists that work in that vein so I could picture.

[00:35:00.060] - Speaker 2
Queen, maybe. Queen-esque.

[00:35:03.100] - Speaker 1
Operatic?

[00:35:04.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah, she was a theater major, and she sang with me. The three of us wrote together, and there wasn't a primary songwriter at this point. It was just the three of us in a room writing.

[00:35:14.520] - Speaker 1
You were already used to sing Harmonie from Church.

[00:35:16.480] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It was very just theatrical. Then maybe the next day when I was sitting in biology, I was writing down band names, and then I had this phrase that was meaningful to me. I brought it to them What do you guys think about this? Yeah, but I don't know if that's a good band name. We're like, All right, well, what if we made an anagram? Keep it a secret. We'll never tell anybody because I love secrets. We're like, Okay. Through them, we met the guitarist. Through the guitarist, and through the guitar, the drummer. Anyway, we did the battle of the bands and we won it, but we were really bad. I think we won because our heart was so jovial and it was so fun. We all had Sharpies and drew mustaches on our face, and It was very theatrical, and it was so different than everything else. Everything else was like… Square. Yeah, it was just like bands. It was like a theater event, and we were immediately best friends. I loved them. There was so much chemistry between us that I think people just voted for us because they were like, They were having fun.

[00:36:17.820] - Speaker 1
Did you ever hang out with musicians before? That was the first time.

[00:36:21.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I really grew up around pretty much with all Muslims, except for my best friend since middle school was very not Norman. He was the scariest kid at school, and I made friends with him because I was so scared of him. Then he became my protector. I was a really nerdy small kid with bad acne and braces and an expander, and I played the saxophone. I played no sports. I played the tenor saxophone, and it was bigger than me.

[00:36:48.980] - Speaker 1
That was your first instrument, saxophone?

[00:36:50.480] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, no, I took piano lessons from 6: 00 to 16: 00 just at home. My mom read something that was like, Kids play piano, they do better math and science.

[00:36:57.780] - Speaker 1
Did you love it, or was it more, this is what you're going to do?

[00:37:00.000] - Speaker 2
I didn't love it. I didn't love it, but I credit it for a lot of my melodic sense because it was all Mozart and Beethoven, and it was all just the classics. That was good. But saxophone in middle school was my first, I chose this instrument. That was my upbringing. My best friend was very not-Mormon, and he was into drugs. It was that first sense of me getting to choose something outside of Morganism and being thrilled by it. This is thrilling. This is exciting. He's getting in fights every day. I'm not getting in the fights. I'm not even helping him. I'm just sitting there scared and hoping he wins.

[00:37:36.040] - Speaker 1
But you got to experience life outside of your bubble, let's say.

[00:37:39.900] - Speaker 2
Yes, and I lived absolutely in a bubble. No cable television, so I'd go to school and I'd be like, Boy meets World. I'm like, I don't even know what that is. I'm glad for that because we didn't ever have TV on in the house. Music was my TV.

[00:37:54.280] - Speaker 1
Did your dad play music a lot in the house?

[00:37:57.180] - Speaker 2
Every once in a while, quietly, my dad would play his guitar and sing in his room. It was always just really peaceful music. I don't know if he ever wrote any songs, but that was my only person I saw doing that. But he was always playing-Records. Constantly records in the house. Then my older brothers, when they got into high school, they had bands. It was primarily ska bands. They were really into… At the time, there was a Mormon band that was taking off called the Aquabats.

[00:38:27.240] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I didn't love it.

[00:38:28.430] - Speaker 2
I'm your girl, I don't care if we live in a garbage can. Mormons. Cool. Actually super cool guys, too. I've gotten to meet them over the years. They ended up doing Yo Gabba Gabba. My brothers were into ska. I didn't really like ska music, but it was just before my time. But then I played… That's why I played the saxophone. So I could play for them in their ska bands because it was all horns. That makes sense. Yeah. I just wanted to be cool with my brothers. Then I started to play drums. I took drum lessons for a couple of years.

[00:38:53.320] - Speaker 1
Where are you in the eighth?

[00:38:54.360] - Speaker 2
I'm the seventh son. I have six older brothers, two younger. I have a younger A younger sister and a younger brother.

[00:39:01.780] - Speaker 1
What was the name of the band that you joined the Battle of the Bands with?

[00:39:07.300] - Speaker 2
Imagin Dragons. We came up with the name for the Battle of the Bands. Then we won the Battle of the Bands, and then there was a Utah's Got Talent thing that was right around the corner, and we were like, Well, let's do this, too. Then we entered that, and we won the Utah's Got Talent. Really? .

[00:39:24.480] - Speaker 1
First two things you did. Was the first gig, the Battle of the Bands, the first time you ever played in front of an audience?

[00:39:29.600] - Speaker 2
First gig ever, yeah.

[00:39:31.220] - Speaker 1
Then was the other one the second or no? You started to be second gig in ever.

[00:39:34.720] - Speaker 2
Maybe one gig locally in between, but it was within a month or something. Then we started to play at this local place in Utah called the Velour, which was 200 people, and we started to just sell it out all the time. And we made an ERP and sold it.

[00:39:47.580] - Speaker 1
How often did you play there?

[00:39:49.120] - Speaker 2
Once a month. And once we started to sell that out, then I beg my mom, and we went to the Utah, I said, Mom, can I defer a semester and come home and live at the house and try to play in LA and see if we can get signed for one semester. Just give me a chance. She really, really did not want me to do it. I just was like, beg turd, and she finally said yes. We went home, the band all moved in, and we started to play our first gig in LA. We booked the Hollywood Cabana Club. I think it was called Nobody Came, Zero People. Then we played the Cat Club and had to hand out flyers. I think we got 50 people from handing out flyers. Then just moved up and moved up and started to make another ERP. We put out four EPs before we got signed.

[00:40:37.180] - Speaker 1
Did you move to LA or you commuted to LA for the shows? Commuted.

[00:40:40.300] - Speaker 2
Commuted to LA. You were still living at home. Yes. Then we started playing in Vegas, LA, Arizona, Utah. And we would just rinse and repeat. And then every day, we would practice for eight hours. We were like, If we're all doing this and we're taking out... And they were all from Berkeley at that point. In the first month, we had five people come in and five people come because it was like, Okay, now we're getting serious. Who can move to Vegas? Well, I can't move to Vegas. Okay, you stay here. It's fine. So if you actually look at the band's origins, it's like there were probably 10 members in the first few months. But then the final four was right in the beginning and has been the same always since. Then we moved to Vegas and then just started to practice every day, and we were totally broke. Then we went to the hotels and asked if we could play cover gigs to make money. They agreed. They said, if you do six... There was a six-hour gig.

[00:41:33.320] - Speaker 1
Which hotels?

[00:41:34.500] - Speaker 2
O'shea's. We couldn't even get to the hotels first. We got O'Shea's, which was the cheapest beer on the strip. You can imagine what that's like. It's all slot machines. There was a stage. It was so tiny. We were barely off the ground, and we played from 10: 00 PM to 4: 00 AM. We were allowed to do 80% covers, 20% originals.

[00:41:54.000] - Speaker 1
What would be some of the covers?

[00:41:56.220] - Speaker 2
Anything we wanted. We did everything from the cars to Britney Spears to Michael Jackson, the Proclaimers.

[00:42:06.000] - Speaker 1
Pop and rock music.

[00:42:07.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah, pop rock, a lot of '90s, just because I love the '90s. It was basically whatever we thought was interesting and what could capture a bunch of drunk people playing on the slots, attention. Then we would just try to sell our EPs.

[00:42:21.920] - Speaker 1
By doing those shows, do you feel like it made you better?

[00:42:24.520] - Speaker 2
100%.

[00:42:25.380] - Speaker 1
Because you're playing in front of an audience.

[00:42:27.080] - Speaker 2
You're picking your songs and you're studying them and learning them. You're doing it for eight hours a day? Six hour gigs. 10 PM to 4 AM. Then we would band practice every day. I swear I'm not exaggerating, eight hours we would practice. We had a basement in my mom's house, then we ended up being able to rent a house blocked down from my mom where all the band lived, and we would just practice all day, every day, and wrote, wrote, wrote, wrote, wrote give out at the Battle of the Bands. I don't really… I mean, you can count it, but it was very different. Then our ERP after that was, I believe it was just self-titled Imagine Dragons. That's when we had gone to Vegas and it was the lineup that now we have. It was really just me trying to be the killers, I'd say. I loved the killers, and my older brother at that time had just found the killers and was managing them. Cool. They blew up. I loved Brandon flowers, and I loved the killers, and I thought they were the best band ever. And they were a local band, so that also was like, it can be done.

[00:43:36.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, 100%. I wrote that ERP with the guys, and we recorded it in Vegas. The reason we got signed, actually, is because We ended up playing in the Viper Room, and we're like an LA buzz band. One night, a guy came out who was the assistant to Alex the Kid, who's a hip hop producer. He had heard about our show, came, got the ERP, It gave it to Alex the Kid. He played the CD, and it had its time on it, Hear Me, and a couple of the songs that ended up making our full-length record and said, Hey, this kid's a good writer. Have him come in and write on my hooks. Then we got an email that was just from Alex, the Kid, to my manager that was like, Yo, I like your writing. Come in. It was like that. It was just that. I don't even think it said Alex, the Kid. It was just... Then we googled and, Oh, it's Alex, the Kid. He just did Love the Way You Lie with This is a big deal. Then I drove out to LA just to write with him. Then I ended up staying in a hotel for a month and writing every night hooks for him that were supposed to be for Rihanna or whoever.

[00:44:43.460] - Speaker 2
Then he just After a month of writing, he was like, You're a great writer. I want to sign you and have you just be a solo artist. I was like, I have a band that I've been with for years, but you can sign us. He was like, Let me meet the guys. He met the guys and he was like, Okay, I'll sign you guys. Great. Then Then we proceeded to make our first record in Nightvisions, and it was half of the songs were from the ERP we had already put out, and the other half were songs that we put out with Alex. It was very disjointed also. I think sonically, it was like hip hop with Imagine Dragons and pre-hip hop with Imagine Dragons. It was very sonically different, but it's what made the record cool and interesting. It was just genre hopping because of that.

[00:45:28.140] - Speaker 1
Let's go through each release and just pick a song and we'll listen. Cool. The first one, 2009 Imagine Dragons? Mm-hmm. Okay. Pick a song. I need a minute. Up tight, cover up, curse, strive.

[00:45:44.720] - Speaker 2
Why don't you do Drive? I've always liked Drive. That one is not with me still well.

[00:46:07.260] - Speaker 3
Give me ride. All it takes is a silent night. I want my eyes to see these lights. Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on. But when it comes, it goes. I am on my knees. Oh, forgive me. Give me ride. Look at these people flying in kites. They seem to live for God tonight. Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on. But when it comes, it goes. I am on my knees. Oh, forgive me. Drive, I got my head on a ride. I got my people strapped high. I got my head on a ride. Oh, why? I got my head on a ride. What do you remember about recording it?

[00:47:50.820] - Speaker 2
I remember being really nervous because it was our first time in the studio. It was in Vegas? It was in Vegas, and I really being in a booth because all my recording since my youth had been by myself. I didn't like standing up, having a mic, having an engineer, having a band sitting in a room. Delivering a vocal was really nerve-wracking for me like that. I didn't enjoy it. I could hear it on myself when I listened to that. I'm mainly nervous but excited at the same time because it was actually happening, I felt. I was recording something in a real studio.

[00:48:28.400] - Speaker 1
How soon was this after the Battle of the Bands?

[00:48:32.000] - Speaker 2
Within a year. So really early. Within six months.

[00:48:37.100] - Speaker 1
Then this one, how did you get this around to people?

[00:48:41.060] - Speaker 2
We just made copies of it, put it in a sleeve, and I remember that we thought it was so cool that we made a magic eye out of the front where you can see a dragon.

[00:48:49.320] - Speaker 1
Oh, cool.

[00:48:50.620] - Speaker 2
You remember when you put your nose to it? Then when we played our cover gigs, we just had a big stack of them that we had just printed on or on, and we would just give them to people. The thing about Vegas, people from all over the world and take their CD and go home and spread it. It ended up booking us a lot. Our first gig that we got in Norway, which was international, was because of that. It was like people coming in and then bringing the CD home and falls into someone's hand who's a booker for some Norwegian festival and then brings Imagine Dragons in based off our ERP from unsigned.

[00:49:20.460] - Speaker 1
How do you think growing up in Vegas affected you?

[00:49:24.640] - Speaker 2
Vegas is such a juxtaposition. It's the city of sin and Romans. Vegas was established by the mob and the Normands. Really? If you look into the history of it, it was the Normands moved from Utah into Vegas the same time that the mob came in from the East Coast and started the gambling. You have this interesting intersection of faith and sin. It was fun to grow up like that because I got to see both sides of it. We would drive on the freeway and it'd be naked ladies on the billboards. My mom would be like, Shield your eyes, children. You I'm like, This is great. It was cool because I was able to meet a lot of interesting people and then also be surrounded by Mormons, too. I got to see very, very different Lifestyles, which was good.

[00:50:17.980] - Speaker 1
What's the next ERP?

[00:50:20.540] - Speaker 2
Let's see. Maybe it was Hear Me was next.

[00:50:22.610] - Speaker 1
Hell in Silence?

[00:50:23.340] - Speaker 2
Hell in Silence. Is Emma on that?

[00:50:26.120] - Speaker 1
Yes. Yeah, I think Emma. Let's hear Emma. This is 2010.

[00:50:38.320] - Speaker 3
Production getting a little better, cleaner. Emma stood in front of me, telling me what I'm supposed to be. Jackie loves to run and hide. Give her love and she will die. You're calling me, oh my, oh my. I cross my heart and I hope to die. Burbon streets and bicycles, holding you in carnival. Baby, is my love too old for you? Baby, is my love too old for you? Am I out for you? Am I out for you? Dinnerbells and loaded gun. Innocent is bound to run. Enemies are playing fun, but don't you touch that golden sun?

[00:51:48.500] - Speaker 2
Innocent and sentiment is all our efforts paying them.

[00:51:53.900] - Speaker 3
Baby, is my love too all for you? Am I all for you? Am I all for you? Am I all for you? Beautiful.

[00:52:16.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a little like sleazy Vegas. It feels like Vegas to me in a way that I really love. It's like nostalgic, Fremont Street. I'd still enjoy that one.

[00:52:29.190] - Speaker 1
Were there anything How was it different about that experience of recording in the first one?

[00:52:33.000] - Speaker 2
First time working with a producer.

[00:52:34.600] - Speaker 1
This was another thing that you made independently. You guys made this yourself.

[00:52:38.880] - Speaker 2
Independent, unsigned.

[00:52:41.000] - Speaker 1
How did you get this one out? Also still at live shows.

[00:52:44.120] - Speaker 2
Still at live shows. Just printed on our own, made the cover in Photoshop. That's the reason we're still playing cover gigs and passing them out at cover gigs.

[00:52:53.520] - Speaker 1
You feel like the band was getting better just from the more of those shows you did?

[00:52:57.340] - Speaker 2
100%. Yeah, my voice was... I was starting to find… I still hadn't found my voice. I did not know who I was on a microphone. I was pretending. I was playing pretend, I think.

[00:53:09.160] - Speaker 1
And you're doing covers, but that's how everybody starts. That's the beginning.

[00:53:13.030] - Speaker 2
We would have never made it anywhere if we hadn't had those cover gigs. We could have practiced 8 hours a day, and I think it would have never happened.

[00:53:21.720] - Speaker 1
It's a different thing.

[00:53:22.550] - Speaker 2
You're in front of people. Something can sound great in a room when you're playing it in a room as a band, but when you play it in front of people, suddenly you're like, Oh, this is bad. This is not well received. Or this song works, and I thought it didn't work at all. Something about introducing the unknown factor.

[00:53:39.500] - Speaker 1
When you put your own songs in the context of essentially hits by other people.

[00:53:47.440] - Speaker 2
You're really judged hard.

[00:53:48.840] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. It has to really stand up when you're putting it next to a known loved song.

[00:53:56.980] - Speaker 2
100%.

[00:53:57.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It forces you to-Up the game.

[00:54:00.220] - Speaker 2
Have to. I think it's also why we write so to our strength and to our detriment. Everything I write is very bombastic, I think is a word that I've seen associated with a band that I always hated, but it's big. That's because those were our roots, and you're competing with noise, you're competing with beer, you're competing with slot machines, and all the greatest hits.

[00:54:25.860] - Speaker 1
So you want to get the attention of your audience. Yeah.

[00:54:27.620] - Speaker 2
If we would have played something Something smaller, just nobody would have heard, even if it was great. It didn't matter. You're in Vegas. People are wanting to be entertained. I wanted to entertain them.

[00:54:45.340] - Speaker 1
If I'm ever stopping the songs too short, feel free to say it.

[00:54:47.880] - Speaker 2
I love that you do that. No, I would have you do the same.

[00:54:49.920] - Speaker 1
But if there's any time where you feel like...

[00:54:51.870] - Speaker 2
Oh, the good parts coming up? Yeah, I will. Just tell me. No, these early songs, too. I mean, it's not painful to listen to them, but It's like listening to your earliest stuff.

[00:55:03.040] - Speaker 1
It's interesting. I would say they're pretty great.

[00:55:05.580] - Speaker 2
Thanks, man. It's very different because so much changed when Alex came in, and it changed our trajectory in a lot of ways for better and worse. I think for better because we're here and we get to make a living doing the living.

[00:55:23.170] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. Okay, next is It's Time.

[00:55:28.160] - Speaker 2
Okay. What are the songs on that It's Time, Amsterdam, Tokyo, The River, Leave Me, Fantomime. The River is my favorite on that one. The River. Yeah.

[00:56:00.000] - Speaker 3
In the late midnight hour, when the world has come to sleep, you got to get up. When doubts begin to rise and the world is at your feet, you got to get up. Rich. It's not as bad as it seems. I can't see the reason for somebody else, for anyone but myself. I'm not a selfless man. I'm I'm not a man of wealth. If I had all the world, I would give it to myself. But the trees begin to walk and the ground begins to talk. But myself, Rich. It's not as bad as it seems. I cleanse the river for somebody else, for anyone but myself.

[00:57:47.600] - Speaker 1
What do you remember about that?

[00:57:49.440] - Speaker 2
What was different? I mean, all of these songs, I was really, really spiraling in a faith crisis. I was still wearing Roman garments underneath everything. I remember my mom I remember we started to play a couple of festivals, and it was really hot, and I didn't wear the garments underneath. It's like you wear this special underwear. It's like a T-shirt and long underwear that are sacred to Muslims. Underneath everything at all times. I remember my first show that I played without them, my mom noticed and was really upset with me and was like, I noticed you didn't wear your grout. I was like, Mom, it was like 100 degrees on this stage. Because it keeps you modest. It's all built in a way it's not supposed to show so that you stay modest. In listening to that song, for instance, I hear so many references to me struggling with faith. I hear it a lot in the lyrics in a way that, I wouldn't say it makes me sad, But it more just makes me remember when I was so conflicted.

[00:58:53.140] - Speaker 1
And the recording process, anything different?

[00:58:56.620] - Speaker 2
That we self-produced at the Palms in Las Vegas. It was our biggest studio we'd been in. I remember it being such a big deal that we got in there. It was a really fun experience. We also worked with Brandon Darner, who was in one of my favorite bands called the Envy Corps, and he helped produce that record. I feel like that record is maybe the closest to we understood what Imagine Dragons was at that iteration. It It was our best body of work, and we recorded its time there, which ended up being our first single that blew the band up. It's good memories.

[00:59:40.880] - Speaker 1
At this time, were you playing your own shows? Were you doing your Are you still doing material or still doing covers?

[00:59:46.720] - Speaker 2
We were still doing both. We were doing our own shows and covers still at this point because that's how we paid for rent the house. Until we got signed, we were playing covers. Until we signed and got an advance. Was that three or four years, would you say? Yeah, three or four years.

[01:00:02.080] - Speaker 1
Were your own shows growing at this time?

[01:00:04.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Every show that we played, every time we'd go back, we'd go to St. George in Utah, we'd go to Provost, Utah, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Arizona, LA. Every time we'd go, we'd get bigger. We played The Roxy in LA, which was a step up from the Viper Room as far as capacity and more buzz. We were seeing progress, but it also was really hard progress, so much so that the drummer at the time and His wife, who you hear singing on everything, she played the synth. They finally were like, Guys, we gave it one more year. It's just too much work. It's too much work. We're going to go have a baby. We were like, No fault. We understand it. We almost broke up. I had a call with Wayne, our guitarist, and was like, Do we give this another six months together? Because it was just such a grind. We were like, Well, every show has more people.

[01:00:54.660] - Speaker 1
It's building. It's building.

[01:00:56.560] - Speaker 2
But it's not really sustainable. It's not sexy. It's It's not fun. It's hard. You're loading all your own gear, and you're also doing it for four years or three years or whatever it was. It's scary. You're playing shows all the time. You're like, Are people even going to come tonight? Sometimes not. Even though we were growing, you go play in some no-name place. Nobody knows you. You're playing at a bar to five people, and you drove 300 miles to get there. It's not sexy. It's not fun. He was like, Yeah, I think we should. If you're down, I'm down. I was like, All right, I'm down. They had dropped out of the band, and then, I think two months later, we got signed. They dropped out of the band, and then Daniel Platzman, who came in, the guys knew him from Berkeley. They had all gone to Berkeley School Music for Jazz, Wayne and Ben. It was me, Wayne, Ben, Andrew, Brittany. Andrew, Brittany said, Hey, we're going to go have a kid. Platzman moved to Las Vegas. Alex, the kid, came to the next... Remember, his guy came to the show. Then I went and wrote with him for a month, and we got signed within the next two months.

[01:01:58.560] - Speaker 1
Did you listen to the radio When were you growing up?

[01:02:01.160] - Speaker 2
Really, how I consumed almost everything was radio. I'd sit by the radio and I had a tape cassette, and I would make mixtapes. I'd record whenever a song came on, and I'd listen to Mix 94. 1 in Las Vegas, which was alternative music, and then 98. 5, 97. 5, which was hip hop. I would just go back and forth, and I would wait for a song to come on. I liked it. I hit record. I just made tons of mixed tapes that were all just radio songs. I grew up really on singles. When people were like, What's your favorite album? I'm like, I didn't have a lot of favorite albums, my favorite songs. I love this song by the Fugees. It's going to be their most popular song. I love this song by Nervon. It's their most popular song. That's what I grew up on. I think, again, that's probably why I love big melodies. I love big sounding songs for better or for worse. I didn't consume albums because I couldn't buy albums because my mom would never let me buy those albums.

[01:02:53.270] - Speaker 1
It could say anything, these albums.

[01:02:55.070] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[01:02:56.780] - Speaker 1
Okay, so next is the fourth ERP, which is after you've signed, yes?

[01:03:02.580] - Speaker 2
Yes, and that's… Continued Silence? Continued Silence, yes, because we had a song called Helen Silence off the earlier ERP.

[01:03:10.580] - Speaker 1
It's got radioactive demons on top of the world, round and round, it's It's Time, or My Fault.

[01:03:16.460] - Speaker 2
Let's do Round and Round.

[01:03:32.800] - Speaker 3
We are all living the same way, the same way. We are escaping the same way, the same way. Circling. We are a part of the same play, the same play. We think we're making our own way, our own way. Circle me. You don't have to hold your head up. Round and round, round and round away this time. Can you show me what this love before. Round and round, I'm not going to let you change my mind. Till you show me what this love before. We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction, building a case for a fiction, a fiction circling. God, I'm ♪ You're not going to need a tower of ancients, of ancients, shooting down arrows in patience, in patience, they circled in. You don't have to hold your head up high and low, high, high, high, high, Beautiful.

[01:05:30.940] - Speaker 1
Thanks. What was different about that?

[01:05:34.020] - Speaker 2
I think just honesty. Yeah, it actually made me a little emotional listening to that because I haven't listened to that since... I don't even know the last time I listened to that. But I really stayed in Romanism for a long time because I was so afraid of letting down Romans. And just religiosity in general. I was afraid of letting down my family. I was afraid of letting down my mom. It's interesting because I know a lot of times I wrote these songs in the moment I didn't even know what I was singing about. I think the reason it was moving to me to listen to that is because I know what I was singing about now.

[01:06:05.440] - Speaker 1
Tell me what it means now when I listen to it.

[01:06:08.020] - Speaker 2
What I'm talking about I'm afflicted by fiction, Romanism became fiction for me. Then the pre-chorus is you don't have to hold your head up anymore. I just felt like I was so tired of living something that was not true for me and living it because I didn't want to let my mom down. I didn't want to let my family down. I didn't want my friends down. All these people who you're taught as a religious person that Be wary of becoming prideful and learned. Be wary of becoming educated. Be wary of riches because this worldliness will take you away from God. That was so imprinted in my brain that when the band started to take off, I almost wanted to just stay in it. Just be...

[01:06:53.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Did you say you felt guilty about it?

[01:06:55.760] - Speaker 2
Oh, yes. I felt very guilty about leading people astray. It seems probably silly to other people, but the people I cared about the most by far was my family and friends. Of course. Not to think that everybody's going to follow me away and I hold that much weight, but just the fact of here's my buddies and my best friends and my sister, all these people that I loved. I was the first one in that group to be like, Hey, guys, I might not do this anymore. That's a really sad thing when it's your whole culture and it's your people. It's beyond just religion. Normanism is your everything. You do it every day, not just Sunday, not holiday. It's every day. My sister wept when I left the church and had a call with me. It was like, This has been really hard on my faith. It's shook in my faith to watch you leave because so much of my faith was in you doing it. You're my older brother. That was a really hard conversation for me, feeling like I was letting her down.

[01:07:52.150] - Speaker 1
What did you say to her? Do you remember?

[01:07:54.460] - Speaker 2
I tried to explain to her that I'm not leaving anything. I still believe in in greater things, and I'm still going to be looking to be a good person and love, and we're going to go to the same place. It's all going to work out. But I think that when you're really in it, I remember how that felt when people told me those kinds of things when I was really in Normanism, and it just feels like words. You're like, No, but we're not. Normands believe in three heavens. If you're in the top heaven and you're in the second heaven, you don't see the people in the top heaven. Hanging out in a different room. There's a Celestral Kingdom, Terrestrial Kingdom, Telestral Kingdom. The lowest kingdom is supposed to be so good that if man were able to see it, they would kill himself to be there. That's what you're talking. That's the lowest level. That's the lowest level. That's filled with murders, rapists, robbers. That's the lowest level. Hell is reserved in mormonism's belief only for people who die, see God so they have a perfect knowledge and reject. I don't want to I reject you.

[01:09:00.980] - Speaker 2
I now have a perfect knowledge of you. I reject you. Those are the only people that go to hell. And I was like, Cool, this is awesome. So even the murders and stuff, that makes sense because maybe if I was raised that way and I had this happen, who knows? Maybe I'd be a murderer. I don't know. And so I was always like, that makes sense to me more than people being punished for their upbringings, for maybe they'd be a better person than me if they were born in my shoes and had mom and dad. But Romans really believe that you don't get to travel up, but up can come down. So if my parents, for in the sestral kingdom, I'm down here with the rapists and murderers, they can come down and be like, hey, what's up? Good to see you down there. You're not up here with us. Creating new worlds. That's a whole other thing we can get into, which is cool. Romans believe you get to make new worlds. I was envisioning myself making fishes and stuff. Yeah, that was great. But it's a great religion for somebody who loves fantasy and sci-fi and stuff like that.

[01:09:52.300] - Speaker 2
It's cool.

[01:09:56.620] - Speaker 1
You were signed by that fourth ERP. Why do you decide to make another ERP instead of an album?

[01:10:02.820] - Speaker 2
To build buzz into the album, I think, was the label's feeling. You have a small following, but why don't we make it a bigger following? I think it was also probably for them to save money. They're like, Let's see how this does. I see. They put it out and it just started to blow up. It's Time got put in the Perks of Being a Wallflower, I remember, was a big movie that used it for its trailer, and then it just started to blow up. Then Radioactive, on the heels of that, just took off. Then Demons, it just put more momentum. Then here's the record now. It worked. I don't know if that worked anymore.

[01:10:36.900] - Speaker 1
How long was it between the last ERP and the first album?

[01:10:40.040] - Speaker 2
Three, four months because we did that ERP that we just listened to was when we signed. Probably two months after we signed, we put that out. Then we waited three months and let that build.

[01:10:50.820] - Speaker 1
Had you already recorded the first album or not yet?

[01:10:53.100] - Speaker 2
We were recording it during that process. I see. Yeah.

[01:10:56.680] - Speaker 1
Okay, so the first album, 2012, Both Nightvisions. What should we listen to?

[01:11:04.260] - Speaker 2
What are the tracks on that?

[01:11:06.020] - Speaker 1
Radioactive, Tiptoe, It's Time, Demons, On Top of the World, Amsterdam, Hear Me Every Night, Bleeding Out, Underdog, Nothing Left to Say.

[01:11:17.760] - Speaker 2
I liked Tiptoe a lot on that record.

[01:11:58.320] - Speaker 3
In the morning ♪ Let me get to the night ♪ Let my roots take flight ♪ Watch me fall above like a vicious dove ♪ They don't see me come, who can blame them? ♪ They never seem to catch my eye, ♪ But I never wonder why. I won't fall asleep, I won't fall asleep. I won't fall asleep. Don't let them know we're coming, ♪ Tick-tock, Take some time to sit down, keep your head down low. Hey, yeah. Tip to higher. From your slant did you see the morning do sink into the soil? Watch the waterfall. They won't see me run, oh, can't blame them. They I'll never have to. I won't fall asleep. I won't fall asleep. Hey, yeah. Don't ever know we're coming. Hey, yeah. Tip, turn, higher. Take some time to sit me down, keep your head down low. Tip-tip, higher. From your slanted view, see the morning do sink into the soil. Watch the water fall. They won't see me run. Oh, can't blame them. They never looked to see me fly, so I never had to. I won't fall asleep. I won't fall asleep. Don't let them know we're coming.

[01:13:44.820] - Speaker 3
You take me higher, nobody else. You take me higher, nobody else. You take me higher, nobody else. You show, hey, yeah. Don't let them know we're coming. Hey, yeah. Tip, turn, higher.

[01:14:03.660] - Speaker 1
You remember about that recording?

[01:14:07.440] - Speaker 2
Me and Wayne recorded almost all of that just in his room, which was really fun. We didn't often do that. Usually, he would write stuff and send it to me, and I'd write stuff in my room, where I would do stuff and send it to him, and he'd add guitars. Or I would go in with a producer, and I'd write, and then Wayne would come in and add. It was always like that. That was one of the rare times where him and I were in a room together, creating from the ground up.

[01:14:36.700] - Speaker 1
For the majority of the album, the band didn't go into the studio together and play the songs.

[01:14:41.860] - Speaker 2
It depends on the song. Every song they ended up coming in and playing on after the fact, if they weren't in it. For Radioactive and Demons, I think both of those were just me in a room creating with the track, and then the guys came in and added after. Tiptoe, Amsterdam, It's Time, were all us in a room creating those songs. It's time started with just me on a laptop, and then we went into the studio and the guys, we all recorded it together. But hear me was just Wayne sent me a guitar, and I just recorded on my own. That one was him and I in a room together, and it was fun. It was where I really felt like I started to really connect to Wayne in a deeper way. When I hear that, that's my first memory. Yeah.

[01:15:28.400] - Speaker 1
Based on that being a good experience, did you start doing more of that?

[01:15:31.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Wayne and I have a really interesting relationship. We're best friends. Never have gotten in a fight. Never. Which is really rare for a band. We just are fiercely loyal to each other. But Wayne is the opposite of me. He's very organized with his thoughts. He's a very introverted, deep fincher, quiet, introspective, beautiful He's an amazing person. Such a good dad, such a good friend, so loyal. He represents to me the opposite of what I am in a way that's very calming for me. Yeah.

[01:16:11.480] - Speaker 1
It makes for a good partnership. Tell me how the first album was received in the world.

[01:16:17.660] - Speaker 2
First album came out and it just did gangbusters. It was just massive. It felt like this weird moment where Wayne and I, I remember so many times throughout the years when we were not signed, we were like, Are we We were crazy. Maybe we're not good enough.

[01:16:33.300] - Speaker 1
You said, Give it six more months. Yes. There was a chance you could have broken up.

[01:16:37.370] - Speaker 2
We kept having these conversations. We were like, I think people who have the EPs tell us they listen to it all the time, that they really enjoy it. But maybe that's not good enough. We had a couple of labels that passed on us before that label. They would be interested. Atlantic was really interested, took us to Disneyland. You know what I mean? They were like, courted us and then didn't pull the trigger. Interesting. We had all these, are we? Almost. Almost, but just never happening. When the record came out and it just went huge, we were both like, we weren't crazy. These songs that we're writing, they're big songs, whether it's good or bad. They're big and they're connecting with everyone around the world. We had always thought that for years. It was this feeling of like, but also so overwhelming. Totally throwing a Mormon missionary boy into the just lion's dead. It was really... Then meeting all my heroes and people that I love and being like, Oh, I really don't like a lot of these people and this sucks, man. This isn't what I thought it'd be. I hated everything else that came with it.

[01:17:47.940] - Speaker 2
It sounds like a cliché to say it, but I really genuinely hated the fame side of it. I hated the weirdness with your changes in your relationships with your family, changes in your relationship with your friends. People don't know how to act around you, or at least it feels like it. It's weird. I hated all of that. You can't go back.

[01:18:04.640] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:18:05.160] - Speaker 2
It's like you've signed the blood oath, and here you are. I was like, damn. I remembered, I had this thought in my head all the time where I prayed on my mission. I was like, God, if you let me do it, I promise I can handle it. I would say that every time. I promise I can handle it. I remember just being like, I can't handle this. I can't handle this. It's like, ruining my relationship. It's ruining my... Now I want to turn to drugs. I was like, I can't actually handle it. I thought I could. I was like, I bet everybody thinks they can, but you can't, man. Really, you got to be like… It's crazy. Yeah.

[01:18:35.520] - Speaker 1
No one is prepared for it.

[01:18:39.250] - Speaker 2
You can never explain that in a way that it's ever going to make sense. No. You can't. You don't even start.

[01:18:45.000] - Speaker 1
Because it seems like that's what you want. Yes. But then when it's there, yes, there's definitely great stuff about it, but it's not all great. No. How did shows change once the album came out? Up until that point, we were still doing the We were still doing the circuit.

[01:19:01.140] - Speaker 2
We never stopped doing the circuit. Even when we got signed, the label was like, Just keep building.

[01:19:05.560] - Speaker 1
Did you spread the circuit? Did it get bigger?

[01:19:07.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah. We didn't have a tour bus at first. Even when we got signed, we had a sprinter van. We started just Midwest festivals, radio festivals. Anybody who wanted us anywhere, we were there. Then it was like, In order to make that one, you got to go on a flight. We were just ping-ponging everywhere around the globe.

[01:19:25.140] - Speaker 1
How many shows did you do in that first year, you think?

[01:19:27.840] - Speaker 2
I remember the year-end came out and there was a Polestar thing. It was top touring at most shows this year, and we were number two. I think it was us and Kendrick that year. It was like we played 300 plus shows or something.

[01:19:42.490] - Speaker 1
Amazing.

[01:19:43.720] - Speaker 2
We just went everywhere and did everything.

[01:19:46.510] - Speaker 1
Was that harder work than the work before?

[01:19:50.260] - Speaker 2
Oh, yes. First of all, you're in the spotlight of everything suddenly, and everything hurt. Everything hurt to me. I was suddenly this artist who was very sensitive. Any review, any criticism felt just like the end of me. I was like, Okay, never mind. I don't want to do this actually more. I want to go back to just writing for my dad. I don't want to... Can I go back? How do I go back? But also, this is everything I've always wanted I always wanted. The very conflicting thing of very scared, but also continually trying to remind myself of, remember who you are, love yourself. It's okay to end up listening. It was just like, I was not built for it. There were a lot of people in the band who were like, Fuck, I'm not Fuck it. I don't give a fuck. I was not that. Everything hurt. Everything felt. Everything.

[01:20:35.060] - Speaker 1
Would you talk about it with the other band members?

[01:20:36.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah, me and Wayne would. It was hard for Wayne, too. The spotlight of it all was like, both of us wanted to just hide. Ben, no. Ben was built for it. No problem. Easy. He was like, I don't care. He was funny. Everything was funny to him. It was just like, This is awesome. Who cares? I love Ben for that. He's always been that presence, very calming presence of a rational presence.

[01:20:59.140] - Speaker 1
Then how How many people would be at the shows that you'd be playing?

[01:21:02.780] - Speaker 2
Everything was sold out. Once that ERP came out-Size of the End, let's say. We started clubs, so 300. Then I remember we played at 600 people sold out, and that was a huge deal. It was a large club. Then we did all large clubs, and then we did all theaters. Then it was amphitheaters, arenas, and everything sold out always.

[01:21:26.670] - Speaker 1
It was just-Areenas even at the end of the first album? Yeah.

[01:21:31.080] - Speaker 2
Also, I remember us having to play festival slots where we didn't even have enough songs to fill up the time. We were high up on the bill enough that we had an hour and a half set, and we were like, We only have 45 minutes of material. We have an hour of material? I don't know. How are we going to do this? Do a couple of covers, too, I guess?

[01:21:46.160] - Speaker 1
The fact that you were selling out big shows is interesting, too, because you were having hit songs, but there's a lot of artists who have hit songs and don't sell any tickets.

[01:21:55.040] - Speaker 2
I think the band has thrived on our live show. We were ready for it. I've seen the opposite now because now I've gotten to sign a couple of acts, and I've seen young acts now that have a hit and go on a stage, and they just don't know what to do. It doesn't translate.

[01:22:11.710] - Speaker 1
But it's because of all those years of doing all those hours, six hours a night.

[01:22:16.420] - Speaker 2
100%. Figuring out who you are on stage. Then suddenly, when you're put on the big stage at the festival, you're ready for it. We were ready. We were like, Let's go. Let's put on the best damn show and we can do it.

[01:22:26.960] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the 10,000 hours.

[01:22:28.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the 10,000 Hours. Yeah. I think that's what changed it for us. People would come to our show, and then they go home and say, Hey, we got to go to their next show. Tell their friends, Hey, you should go see Madden Dragons Live. It's a good show. That word is really what took the flame and just stoked it, stoked it up.

[01:22:43.320] - Speaker 1
What's the first time you played outside of the United States?

[01:22:46.200] - Speaker 2
Norway.

[01:22:47.380] - Speaker 1
When was that?

[01:22:48.400] - Speaker 2
Bergenfest, and they flew us out to play it, and we were the only American act.

[01:22:55.260] - Speaker 1
It was just-How was that experience?

[01:22:57.160] - Speaker 2
Amazing. Still to this day, maybe international experience because it was my first time out of the States ever. My eyes were just so opened as this Norman boy of like, Wow, look at all these people, and they're happy, and they're not Norman, and There's not even one more of it. Everybody's living this. It's okay. It's okay. In fact, it's great. Wow, there's this culture. Vegas is not a cultured place. No. It couldn't be further from it. I was seeing like, healthy living farmers markets and people out walking and staying out late at a dinner table and eating food till 5 AM and drinking wine and walking home drunk together and singing and all these things in cobblestone roads. I was just like, This It was amazing.

[01:23:46.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:23:47.120] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:23:48.040] - Speaker 1
That's great.

[01:23:48.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:23:49.740] - Speaker 1
Then the next album.

[01:23:51.560] - Speaker 2
Smoking Mirs. Yeah. This was probably what happens to most artists, which is you have your first album and it does this huge thing and you're like, What do we even do? Then we just decided, Okay, we're going to self-produce a whole record. Every song on that record probably has 200 tracks. It just was so dense.

[01:24:13.800] - Speaker 1
Overdone, you'd say?

[01:24:14.700] - Speaker 2
So overdone. So overdone, but still maybe my favorite of our records.

[01:24:19.080] - Speaker 1
That's interesting.

[01:24:19.870] - Speaker 2
Because it was the darkest time period for me. Heavy, heavy depression on a level I'd never experienced. Really, really bad depression.

[01:24:28.680] - Speaker 1
In success.

[01:24:30.100] - Speaker 2
In success. My deepest depression. It's called Smoking Mirs because the whole thing was just, now I've left Morganism. Now what? My whole life was based on Smoking Mirs. My whole life was just based on a lie. I was just like, Fuck everything. I'm just like, I have no guide. We were lost. Lost. It was a very lost record.

[01:24:56.020] - Speaker 1
What song?

[01:24:56.660] - Speaker 2
Maybe it's a title track, Smoking Mirs.

[01:25:15.080] - Speaker 3
This is my word. This is my way. Show me a sign. Sweep me away. This is my word. Heartbreaker, gatekeeper. I'm feeling by the way, I'm feeling right. Deep in my heart, deep in my mind. Take me away, take me away. This is my word. Dreammaker. I've taken. All I believe is in a dream maker, life taker. All we see is in a dream, that comes crashing down on me. All I love is it's smoking mirrors. I want to believe. I All that I want is it to smoke and be litters. I want to believe. But all that I want is it to smoke and be litters. All that I've known, buildings of stone, all to the ground without a sound. This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper. ♪ I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right. ♪ I'm starting to came, I'm losing my flame. ♪ I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain to disappear. ♪ Dreammaker, life taker. ♪ Open up my eyes. ♪ All I'm hearing is in a dream, ♪ That your voice crushing down on me. ♪ All below, is it your smoking mirrors? ♪ I want to believe. Love it all.

[01:27:28.040] - Speaker 3
Is it just something you? I believe. I'm All I believe is it a dream that comes crashing down on me. Over love, easy to smoke and me. I want to believe. Over love, easy to smoke and me. I want to believe.

[01:28:14.100] - Speaker 1
Over love, easy to smoke and me. Sounds very vulnerable.

[01:28:18.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think it was the first record that I was like, No more metaphors. I'm not going to hide anything from my parents anymore. It is what it is. Yeah.

[01:28:29.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah, Would you say the songs are typically autobiographical, even when they're metaphorical?

[01:28:35.560] - Speaker 2
Always. I think I don't know any other way to write, really. I'm not a great storyteller. I just write as a journal. What's happening in you? What's happening? I don't know. I've tried to… One of my favorite songwriters of all time is Paul Simon because he can do that. So a man walks down, so you lie, lie, lie. Story. Yeah, and I love that. I can't do it. When I try to do it, it just sounds bad. For me, it's just What am I feeling?

[01:29:02.260] - Speaker 1
What do you remember about recording the second album?

[01:29:07.060] - Speaker 2
I remember feeling like we had so much pressure on us. It was like, Hey, your record just went seven times platinum or whatever it was. What's the next single?

[01:29:17.440] - Speaker 1
Now, what are you going to do? Yeah.

[01:29:19.130] - Speaker 2
Just show us. There was also a sense of maybe everything we do is just huge.

[01:29:24.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah. There was so many- It would go either way.

[01:29:26.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it was like, Radioactive did Gangbusters, then Demons did It was just doing these crazy numbers at the time. It was like breaking all these records. I think I was like, did we just get really lucky or do I just know how to write really big songs?

[01:29:42.540] - Speaker 1
No way to know.

[01:29:44.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think I was just confused. I also didn't understand how big it was. It was just everywhere suddenly in the world, everywhere.

[01:29:54.660] - Speaker 1
Were you touring around the world at that time?

[01:29:56.250] - Speaker 2
We went everywhere because my My brother was like, If you don't hit these markets now, you won't be able to hit them later. It doesn't matter how big you are. He was like, There's ginormous artists that never went to Asia, and now they go to try to play it, and Asia doesn't care because you didn't grow with them. So go everywhere. So we went everywhere. And because of that now, America is our smallest market. Really? We just played in China and did six stadiums and sold it out in under a minute. Under a minute, six stadiums in China. We've only been to China two times before that.

[01:30:30.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but you went at the right time.

[01:30:32.020] - Speaker 2
But we went at the right time. They felt like we've grown with them. Yeah. Europe, South America, everywhere is bigger than the US even for us. And the US is a huge market for us. But that's to show you how international the band is, and it's because we did that, but it almost killed us. Genuinely, the amount of ping-ponging, and it was only humanly possible because we were such young kids. We were like 22. Any time there wasn't a show that we couldn't do, someone would just pump me with prenazone. It was like, prenazone in the ass, get on the stage, go do it. We just did it. In our first five years, we canceled one show, Rick. One in five years because we just, no matter what, we just did it because we knew what it was like to be a broke musician for years. We were so afraid. It was almost like trauma of like, it could all go away, but it won't. It won't, guys. We're big enough now. It won't go away. It You could be okay. But I felt that on the second record. It was like, no, no, you're going to be a one hit.

[01:31:36.020] - Speaker 1
It happens to a lot of bands. They have a great first album. They had their whole life to write it. And then can't follow it up.

[01:31:44.210] - Speaker 2
It happens. When we put out Smoking Mears and it did, I don't know, one-tenth, maybe, of what the first record did, it was not-It would be successful by any normal metric if the first album wasn't a phenomenon. A hundred %. It was like, Okay, this This is what happens when we self-produce everything. Our fans loved it. Most fans of the band will say Smoking Mears is their favorite record because it's so dense and because it's so… Maybe because it's so vulnerable, maybe because it captured a really specific time in our life or something. But it sold so much less. Then we're in a weird spot where it's like, Okay, what do we do now?

[01:32:25.500] - Speaker 1
Let's see what's next. Evolve.

[01:32:29.540] - Speaker 2
Yeah. This record ended up selling more than Nightvisions. It's like we went to Gang Busters, and then we went to Smoking Mirs, and then we did Evolve, and this was our biggest record to date.

[01:32:41.860] - Speaker 1
What do you think was different? What allowed that to happen?

[01:32:44.730] - Speaker 2
Changing Things Up. What? Worked with new people, brought in new producers. I tried writing with different producers. That changed the sound. It brought out a new variation of the band. The first record was very influenced by Alex the Kid, so it has these heavy hip hop things going on. Second record was just the band, really self-produced, and so it was very band-y, I would say. Third record was we primarily worked with these Swedish producers, Matt, Man, and Robin, who We'd just come off, Smoking Mears, it was 200 tracks. They were like, A song should be six tracks, and every track should matter so much, and it should sound perfect. They were very meticulous. It was a completely different approach. They really challenged me in ways that were difficult. They're Swedish, and they're just these two really quiet, sweet guys, but very specific. They don't tell you if they don't like something, but you just know. It's just like, okay. But very smart with sounds. Every sound, every drum, interesting, fun to listen to, clean, Swedish. That was an interesting juxtaposition because we were so big and my voice was so big, and then it's over these very clean things.

[01:34:08.880] - Speaker 2
It was just a new take on Imagine Dragons. Again, for better or for worse, it just was different.

[01:34:13.760] - Speaker 1
Did you like the experience? Or was Other than the fact that it was difficult?

[01:34:18.700] - Speaker 2
I liked it as much as everything. I like most when I'm just writing a song by myself on my computer. That's when I like most. But I liked that equal to liking every other experience in a studio. Because also there was a lot of fun and they would light up when something was great. So it was still working with someone who was great, just someone in the room who was helpful. Because of the language barrier, maybe, I felt I could still write my lyrics and not be judged about it. That felt nice. I was able to be vulnerable, I think, still. I don't think I've ever approached a record trying to do something different. Even Smoking Mears, we were trying to make a great record. We weren't trying to make a cool record.

[01:35:07.340] - Speaker 1
Every time it's the same, you're going in, Let's do our best.

[01:35:10.520] - Speaker 2
Let's make our biggest best songs. And by the way, let's comb through your 300 songs and find if there's some gems in there. And if not, let's create on top of that. There's so much material, and we're just trying to find the best of what is. Yeah. So then Evolve came out, and then it did the Night Vision again, all over again.

[01:35:32.420] - Speaker 1
What's a good song for us to listen to?

[01:35:34.260] - Speaker 2
I really like I don't know Why off that record.

[01:35:36.960] - Speaker 1
Let's hear it.

[01:35:42.920] - Speaker 3
We could be strangers in the night. We could be passing in the shadows. We couldn't be closer if we tried. When we're caught When we're caught in the headlights, we could be faces in the crowd. We could be passing in the shadows, loving the risk of being found. When we're caught in the headlights. Dangerous. Your love is always dangerous, and now I'm lost in We're living in a lion's life. I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you, to do with you. I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you, to do with you. I was a faking alibi, trading the truth in for a lie. We were the essence of desire, and we're caught in the head of reach. Dangerous. Your love is always dangerous, and now I'm

[01:37:54.200] - Speaker 3
Do your personal relationships work their way into the songs?

[01:37:59.460] - Speaker 2
Yes, but not often. I think when I write about personal relationships, I often write in fantasy, only in that sense. I think for a lot of complex issues, it's like, first of all, when you're living with someone and they're listening to everything you do, it's weird if you're having a fight and then they hear your song and it's like, and maybe that song is heard everywhere now. But there's a couple of songs that I've written throughout the years. One of them, I think my favorite song I've ever written with the band is a song called Next to Me. It's very much about a relationship, and it's about my relationship with my ex-asia. It's a really sad song. It's a really vulnerable song. I do sometimes, but mostly not.

[01:38:46.300] - Speaker 1
Next is fourth.

[01:38:48.740] - Speaker 2
Origins. Origins was really like a B-sides of Evolve. We had so many songs. It was just like, okay, Evolve just went big. I mean, there were so many other songs that didn't make that record, and it did so good. Why don't we just continue on that? I think it came out a year later.

[01:39:07.960] - Speaker 1
Most of it recorded during the same period of time?

[01:39:10.360] - Speaker 2
Some during the same period and some right after while I was on the road. Because even when I was out recording involved, I was still brought out a laptop with me and I'd record in a lot of hotel rooms.

[01:39:19.680] - Speaker 1
Do you do that typically when you're on the road?

[01:39:22.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because when I'm on the road, I'm actually a real reclusive person. I know for some bands, the road is It's not for me. I really love to experience food, so we'll find some really cool place to eat always as a band. Then I like to walk around the streets by myself. I really like to just go wander. But we don't party. None of us party. None of us have been into that ever. We're never going to after parties. We're never going to clubs. We're not at nothing like that. The other thing, if I'm in the hotel room, that I want to be doing is riding. I'm always riding.

[01:40:00.000] - Speaker 1
It's also grueling, flying from show to show, putting on a long show. The workload is such that if you were to try to do something else while you were on the road, the whole thing could cave in.

[01:40:12.880] - Speaker 2
You know what's crazy is I recently got this aura ring that tracks your sleep, and I brought it on tour with me to just see what happens. Whenever I have a show, my sleep that night is horrible. Even if I sleep the amount of hours after the show, even if I sleep the exact same amount of hours, something about the cortisol. I really think it's probably one of the main reasons that musicians turn to drugs, sleeping drugs at night or anything to escape because I think a lot of people think, Oh, you're on this high and you just want to get more high. For me, at least, it's not that. It's actually you're on this high. For me, I wouldn't even say it's a high. You have some really intense experience. For me, it's very emotional, very intense. Now you're in a room by yourself. Something about that juxtaposition is not You're in a dark hotel room by yourself. Here you were, now you're here. Time to go to sleep.

[01:41:05.910] - Speaker 1
It's certainly unnatural.

[01:41:07.720] - Speaker 2
Not natural. My sleep that night, even if I sleep totally, bad. The next night, if we have a day off, sleep's great. My resting heart rate is completely different. I think it's cortisol. I think it's something that I don't know. But I think it's probably taking years off my life to be playing so many shows. Yeah.

[01:41:25.820] - Speaker 1
Is the tour schedule as intense as it's always been, or do you-No, I I really set rules now of I will only play one show and then one day off.

[01:41:36.040] - Speaker 2
If I play two in a row, then two days off. Vocally, I can't sustain otherwise. Our shows now are two hours. The song are operatic. Imagine Dragons is not… No, it's not easy. When I was young, trying to do three or four in a row, I could do it barely, but it was miserable, and it was always hard. I probably had to go on print as on Four times a year would have to have a doctor come shoot me off prednazone.

[01:42:02.120] - Speaker 1
Can you have to have surgery at one point, too?

[01:42:03.390] - Speaker 2
I'd have a polyp that I surgically remove. Now I do one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off. Two days on, two days off.

[01:42:12.200] - Speaker 1
Does that feel more manageable?

[01:42:14.020] - Speaker 2
Totally sustainable. We could put on two-hour shows. I could sing everything, feel good and strong.

[01:42:19.100] - Speaker 1
How is the response in different parts of the world? Tell me any interesting niches around the world that are particular experiences.

[01:42:27.800] - Speaker 2
Everywhere is different. We just played in China, so I guess that's the most recent to me. There's such a wonderful crowd. They all made pamphlets that they made on their own so they could see all the words and sing every song. Really? They all bring out these books. Like him books? Yes, like him books. All through the crowd.

[01:42:45.060] - Speaker 1
But they're made by themselves?

[01:42:46.460] - Speaker 2
Yes. So respectful. A song ends and it's dead silent. Listening, reacting. New song, let's all have it together and sing. It's similar in Japan in that way. South America, it's like everybody Nobody's just there to have the greatest night of their entire life. Nobody cares what anybody thinks. Everybody's sweaty, hot, just life. A lot of Europe is like that, too. Very much like, let's live tonight. It's our last night. Let's have the best. Italy, France. Those are two of our biggest territories, France and Italy. Again, just incredible amount of zest for life. Americans are the most self-conscious, for sure. That's interesting. Very much like when the person next to them is warmed up, then they'll feel more warm. But once they get going, they could be a fantastic crowd. But more stress, maybe. I'm not sure. Maybe because Americans work so much. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but definitely different.

[01:43:39.460] - Speaker 1
Is language ever a barrier?

[01:43:41.460] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:43:42.000] - Speaker 1
People sing along wherever you are.

[01:43:43.500] - Speaker 2
Anywhere, even in China, which is the most alien place, and English is not spoken there at all. I would ask someone where the toilet is, and they don't know what I'm saying. But they sing along. But they sing every word. They have a book and they sing along. They want to. They want to show you that they… It's really a beautiful You think that they appreciate that you're there? For sure. Oh, yes. Also, the way that we were treated was like, I went and saw these seven temples that were so beautiful. You pray and you light these things, and you bowed to the north and south and the east and the west. It was such an incredible experience. But the amount I could feel everyone looking at me to be like, Do you like this? What do you think this is weird. Do you enjoy this? When I'm enjoying I see so much joy in them. Like, wow, this is cool. I think that we're so foreign to each other that it's almost like an alien on a different world. It's like, let me show these things that are really important to me. Do you see why they're important to me?

[01:44:46.080] - Speaker 2
What a beautiful thing to be a part of that interaction. I really enjoyed that. So, yeah, everywhere is so different, but also the same. It's still people wanting to have a communal experience and enjoying seeing something along together that was important to them in their quiet moments.

[01:45:05.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah, beautiful. Let's see what's next.

[01:45:10.360] - Speaker 2
Origins. I think birds. Okay. That's when we still perform all the time. Where do you like that one.

[01:45:19.900] - Speaker 1
It's not here. I'm looking at the regular version.

[01:45:23.250] - Speaker 2
Oh, sorry. I'm on the Deluxe version. Yeah.

[01:45:25.800] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[01:45:45.260] - Speaker 3
Two hearts, one valve popping the blood, we were the flood, we were the body. And two lives, one life. Sticking it out, letting you down, making it Seasons that will change. Life will make you grow. Change will make you cry, cry, cry. Everything is temporary. Everything will slide. Love will never die, die, die. I know that you, birds fly in different directions. I I hope to see you again. Sunsets, sunrises, living the dream, watching the leaves, changing the seasons. Some nights, I think of you. We're living the past, wishing and less, wishing and dreaming. Seasons, they will change. Life will make you grow. Death can make you high, high, high. Everything is temporary. Everything will start. Love will never die, die, die. I'm only in who. Birds fly in different directions. Who.

[01:47:37.520] - Speaker 1
Do you remember lyrically what that was going on at the time?

[01:47:40.860] - Speaker 2
Yeah, actually, that was a relationship song. I had just gone through a separation. Me and Asia had been together for seven years and then broke up and didn't see each other for seven months. Not only so many sevens? Sevens. It's the sevens, and I'm seven son. We didn't see each other for seven months. I went and I toured Evolve as us broken up. That was a really strange, wonderful, hard, weird time for me. Finding myself, refining myself out of a relationship, just everything about my life at that time was weird. But that song was really just about lamenting about the end of it, but also seeing the beauty in having someone come into your life still being able to love them from afar. Then after seven months, I came home. We did ayahuasca together and got back together.

[01:48:39.080] - Speaker 1
It doesn't sound like an angry song. It sounds like that beautiful song.

[01:48:43.920] - Speaker 2
We've never had anger. Even after our divorce, there's never been anger with me and Asia. I think that there's such a deep sense of love and respect between the two of us that we never fought, never anger, never. Just the Two artists trying really hard to make things work and co-existing. A lot of heartbreak, a lot of joy, a lot of everything, but never anger.

[01:49:10.680] - Speaker 1
You said in your mind, this album's really a continuation of the last album.

[01:49:17.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it really was. Sonically and time period-wise. Okay.

[01:49:21.980] - Speaker 1
Nicks is Mercury.

[01:49:24.120] - Speaker 2
Mercury. That's such a long one, too, because we did one and two. My My final feeling of Mercury is just fun, joy. I really was in a very happy, joyful, healthy spot when we wrote that record. Even coming here today, I just only have good feelings associated with this. I think also just the time period it captured, I was entering for the first time in my life a spiritual healthy place. I was starting to find footing. I I felt like it was a very effortless experience. We were just having fun.

[01:50:05.120] - Speaker 1
What song do you want to hear?

[01:50:08.120] - Speaker 2
I think because we've listened to so many sad, nostalgic ones, I think maybe Cutthroat would be fun to listen to.

[01:50:26.060] - Speaker 3
I've been waiting patiently about this tower quietly, and when my well of Wellbutrin is a new dry of serotonin, I can say things I don't mean, or maybe it's the truth in me. I feel it building bubbling up. My time is up. I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this. My money's good, and I came to win.

[01:50:55.100] - Speaker 2
So step on up, and I promise you, only one of us is going to make a I'm not alive, and it's not you. Only one of us, only one of us, can make it out alive, and it's not you.

[01:51:08.240] - Speaker 3
Only one of us, only one of us, can make it out alive. I've been making my guess in my name since I was young. My ancestry was marching martyrdom across the right to the dumbler. Plains of I can't lie, I've been played by powerful people who get their way. But I, in time, will climb my mountain, I, in time, will rise. I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this. My money's good, and I came to win.

[01:51:47.140] - Speaker 2
So step on up, and I promise you, only one of us is going to make a lot alive, and it's not you. Only one of us, only one of us is going to make a lot alive, and it's not you.

[01:52:00.340] - Speaker 3
Only one of us. Only one of us can make it out alive. Try me. Try me.

[01:52:46.140] - Speaker 2
It's pretty agro. Yeah. I love that song. Yeah, me too. Really, that has aged well with me. I just feel like we just I had a lot of fun on that record. It also brought out... It was the first time ever that somebody sat down with me and gone over all my lyrics with me. That was a hard experience for me, even though I tried to act like it wasn't. It was really hard for me. Just because it's already so vulnerable when you're seeing something, something about words on a page and your face to look at every word. But it was a real learning experience for me, too, because I don't pay a lot attention to what I write.

[01:53:35.740] - Speaker 1
It just comes out.

[01:53:36.720] - Speaker 2
It just is out, and it doesn't matter if it's bad or good. I'm not a writer for better or for worse who goes, That line could be better. I write it and I go, That line is what it was supposed to be.

[01:53:49.420] - Speaker 1
Because it's what came out.

[01:53:52.120] - Speaker 2
Yeah. But it was good for me to have to be challenged and to approach something with, look at it twice, rewrite, rethink. I think that that was my big takeaway from that record, was feeling like it's okay to do that. In fact, it could be more meaningful. It could actually be more special. It doesn't always have to be captured in that moment in order for it to be relevant for always. Rays or something.

[01:54:31.500] - Speaker 1
Also, after you do that experiment, if you like the original version, you use the original version. You lose nothing in seeing if it can do even more.

[01:54:44.700] - Speaker 2
It's interesting because I think Mercury... Mercury is also... Fans love that record. I think it's probably Smoking Ears and Mercury are the two fan favorite records because it's somehow Also, it's just so much material. I think they enjoy that. But there was a lot of storytelling. There was a lot going on where I think sometimes to a fault, it can be very concise in our records. It can be very one... Because already it's autobiographical. If it's autobiographical and you wrote it during the time period where you're nostalgic, there you go. It's a nostalgic record. It's a record about losing faith. Mercury covers a lot of ground. That's why I'm glad we did it in two acts. Yeah. Cool.

[01:55:33.860] - Speaker 1
Next is Loom.

[01:55:36.960] - Speaker 2
Loom is our most recent record. Loom really was an effort to capture just a happy Imagine Dragons record, I think. Maybe we'll play one and we could talk about it. I think my favorite off this record, as we've just toured it, is probably Firing These Hills.

[01:55:58.020] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[01:56:00.000] - Speaker 3
I don't think that I'm strong enough. I don't think that I'm enough.

[01:56:11.580] - Speaker 2
And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do too. Staying up these nights, drinking everything, I got nothing without you.

[01:56:30.000] - Speaker 3
I fear I might die alone. I fear I might knock in no one's home. Staying up these nights, thinking everything that I did wrong to you. I don't think that I'm strong enough I'm never enough. I'm never enough. Because there's fire in these hills, and I think I've lost the will. The more we try, the more we fail. But after After everything, you're here with me still. Because there's fire in these hills. And I think I've lost my will. The more we try, the more we fail. But after everything, you're here with me still.

[01:57:19.460] - Speaker 2
Can I turn this car around, open up, sit down, tell you all the truth?

[01:57:27.240] - Speaker 3
Can I fade myself, I'll tuck myself down, lie I fear I might wreck this home. I fear I might knock, no one comes. And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do too. I don't think that I'm strong enough. Because there's fire up in these hills, and I think I've lost my will. The more we try, the more we fail. But I'm wrong, but I do too. I don't think that I'm strong enough. Because there's fire in these hills, and I think I've lost my will. The more we try, the more we fail. But after everything, you're here with me still. Because there's fire in these hills, and I think I've lost my will. The more we try, the more we fail. That's Happy, Imagined Dragons.

[01:58:19.530] - Speaker 1
The opening line is, I don't think I'm strong enough. I I think I've lost my will. It's just interesting.

[01:58:33.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's a good point. Yeah, you know. Maybe that's my obvious song, really. I don't know. I think maybe just overall, the feeling of the record to me when I walked away from it. It was like, it felt happy. But maybe the one thing that's so interesting to me because I haven't done something like this where I've sat and listened to each record in my I think my big realization right now is that I don't actually know what a record's about until a few years later. I really don't. I have ultimate clarity on it now. When you're playing these folk reels, I'm like, Oh, yeah. You're playing me those. Oh, yeah, that's exactly. With this record, maybe in a couple of years, I'll be like, Oh, that was a false happiness. I don't really know because I'm just in it. That's the beauty of the music for me is it's like…

[01:59:26.920] - Speaker 1
You don't think about it. I don't think about it. It just comes out.

[01:59:30.000] - Speaker 2
I don't think about it. It just comes out, and then it's a lesson to be learned later. It's a feeling for me to have now and a lesson for me to learn later.

[01:59:38.330] - Speaker 1
It's like a dream.

[01:59:40.000] - Speaker 2
Yes. It's exactly like that. You're in a dream. You're not thinking about what does this mean. No. No.

[01:59:44.500] - Speaker 1
You're having When you wake up, you usually don't know what it means. But maybe years later, it'll make sense.

[01:59:50.660] - Speaker 2
I do think I very much like that. It's a great analogy.

[01:59:54.860] - Speaker 1
Cool, man. Well, thanks for doing this. Shall we go in there and see what you do, what you took up? Let's do it.

[02:00:01.760] - Speaker 2
Let me use the restroom first. Yeah.

[02:00:03.700] - Speaker 1
Take off this mic. Yes.

[02:00:05.830] - Speaker 2
That was fun, man.

[02:00:07.240] - Speaker 1
Really fun.

[02:00:07.920] - Speaker 2
I didn't know you do it like that.

[02:00:09.580] - Speaker 1
That's fun. There's no right way. I thought it'd be interesting to walk through. What's interesting to me is that as different as all of the changes were, it really sounds like you all the way through. The thread that runs through it is thicker than the difference is along the way, right from the beginning.

[02:00:32.780] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that is interesting for me here, too, because I always have been like, Oh, we're so It's a whole new thing now. Yeah. It is pretty through-wined.

[02:00:42.520] - Speaker 1
It really is.

[02:00:43.600] - Speaker 2
It's like, maybe I'm just singing the same sad song over and over. Fifteen years. Yeah. You know, just dressing it up. Tetragrammatin is a podcast. Tetragrammatin is a website.
