[00:00:06.260] - Speaker 3
Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. It was December of 1967, and we were invited to go to Paris to do a UNICEF show, United Children's Emergency Fund.

[00:00:32.050] - Speaker 1
On that show was Marlon Brando and his Tahitian bride and a couple of dancers and stuff. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Wow. He did How to Handle a Woman, and she would pray across the stage with these signs.

[00:00:45.880] - Speaker 2
Incredible. This is '67?

[00:00:47.310] - Speaker 1
December of '67.

[00:00:48.920] - Speaker 2
Incredible.

[00:00:50.270] - Speaker 1
Well, the curtain opened for our part of the show. There was Marisci in the front row with John Lennon on one side and George Harrison on the other. I said, Holy shit, that's a fucking front row for it.

[00:01:00.240] - Speaker 2
Good audience.

[00:01:02.340] - Speaker 1
That beautiful orchestra. We just did a few songs. Then the after-party, Marlon Brando turns to me and he says, Want to get some breakfast? I mean, it's very Marlon Brando. I mean, it was the real deal. I'm thinking, Michael, out of the Beach Boys, Marlon Brando, Viva's a pot on the waterfront and everything is asking us, I thought, you want to go for breakfast. What am I going to say? That's wild. Yeah, so we did. And he had a Cadillac. This was in December, and Pharreos had a Cadillac convertible pull up and a few cabs. And he invited I and a couple of other group members and they're a He invited us all to go to this after-party, which was given by these gejouled ladies in these gowns. And Victor Borga and the producer of the show were sitting at a table Marlin went into the room and this woman spread eagles herself across the door. I'm entirely sorry. It's a Friday party. Marlin Brando looks at her and says, Oh, man, I'm really sorry. In Tahiti, when one person goes, everyone goes, it's like family. I think I better leave. And he turns as if to leave the party.

[00:02:22.870] - Speaker 1
And that's Liz and Dick over there. She was going to lose Marlin Brando. She I didn't have that. So she led us in and his Tahitian bride and the guy playing a guitar. And I really made the party, actually. Wow. Yeah. So it was amazing.

[00:02:40.760] - Speaker 2
That sounds incredible.

[00:02:41.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And then the next day, we It was in the afternoon, late afternoon, it was dark already. So he's in the lounge of the airline. And I sat next to him on the flight to England. I went to England, and he invited us to go to a party there. Of course, here we go again. Marlin, somebody just goes somewhere. So we did go. That was the last time I personally met him. It was in his presence. But when he turned and did that, the He's Strasberg turn saying, I think I better leave. It was pure Marlin. I mean, you're such a great guy because he needed that.

[00:03:26.690] - Speaker 2
Was he a little older than you at the time?

[00:03:28.080] - Speaker 1
A little bit, yeah.

[00:03:29.090] - Speaker 2
Five years, maybe?

[00:03:29.760] - Speaker 1
Probably. Yeah.

[00:03:31.640] - Speaker 2
I'm just trying to picture what it felt like. Did he feel like an elder statesman or not really?

[00:03:37.090] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. No. To me, he sure did. He was just an amazing actor, of course, and a great guy because he was for the Black Panthers. He didn't take the Oscar because of his Native American situation. So he was a really solid citizen. I mean, It impressed me anyway.

[00:04:02.500] - Speaker 2
Then when did Mahrishy teach you to meditate?

[00:04:05.310] - Speaker 1
Okay, so we got to England. Then I got a call from Dennis Wilson, who was our drummer, and he said, You got to come back to Paris. I said, Why? I like England. I like London. He says, Well, tomorrow, she's going to teach us to meditate. Are you sure? So he called back again. He said, Yeah, it's for sure tomorrow afternoon at such and such time, we have to bring fruit, flowers, and handkerchief. So we found some flowers on the way in to town. We flew back the very next morning from England to Paris. Because I had been interested in meditation, and I've gone to a lecture at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium by a guy named Jerry Jarvis, who was head of the Students International Meditation Society at the time, which was 10:15 Gaeli in Westwood. A lot of people were taught there. In fact, I became a teacher of TM a couple of years later. I actually taught there in Westwood. I taught maybe 100 people.

[00:05:14.110] - Speaker 2
I knew Jerry. I love Jerry. Jerry was the coolest guy.

[00:05:16.710] - Speaker 1
He was a genius, brilliant guy.

[00:05:18.580] - Speaker 2
He was Maharishi's right-hand man in those days.

[00:05:21.630] - Speaker 1
He was at one time. He carried the deer skin. Yeah, absolutely. So you had met him. Yeah.

[00:05:28.440] - Speaker 2
He said he learned to fly helicopter for Maharishi so he could take Maharishi around. Wow. Amazing.

[00:05:35.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:05:35.920] - Speaker 2
What was it like talking to Maharishi? What was the energy like?

[00:05:40.250] - Speaker 1
Well, first of all, Maharishi, as a Hindu monk, and Hinduism is so complicated and so diversified. He is what they call brahmachari, which means celibate. And their whole existence is devoted to enlightenment and God. They have these scriptures, which I'm sure you know, called the Vedas. There's several Vedas, and there's all these codes of behavior in some of the Vedas. So Marishi was a student of Swami brahmananda sara swati, who was a Shankrachari of Jotirmaths. Shankr was a a spiritual person a couple of thousand years ago. I don't exactly know about it. I mean, you can look it up, but he established four seats of Shankra, Shankrachari. Shankrachari, it means seats of Shankra. So Shankr was this enlightened person who just as a teenager, he could cognize. They call it cognize. And they could just put his attention on it and bring out the scriptures of the Vedas and stuff. So Through time, pure knowledge gets eroded. And so he came in at that particular time to clarify these Vedas. And so Guru Dev was was a Shankracharia of Jotirmoth, which is in the north, in the Himalayas. There's four of them in different corners of India.

[00:07:24.010] - Speaker 1
But that seed had been vacant for about 150 years or something. But then Gurudev saw me Ramananda Sarswati. He took that office. It's like a Pope. It's like a Hindu Pope.

[00:07:40.030] - Speaker 2
And Mahrishy was with him for years and years? Yes.

[00:07:43.690] - Speaker 1
He was a disciple of and he used to run errands for him and like a secretary.

[00:07:50.540] - Speaker 2
Then whose idea was it for Maharishi to spread the teachings?

[00:07:54.510] - Speaker 1
Well, Maharishi came up with that after Jibrudip passed away. I see. I was 11 years old when Guradev died, so I never met him. But Maharishi decided to teach this. They call it deep meditation. Then they changed the name to transvadele meditation. After learning meditation in Mauritius, I went to a thing called the Science of Creative Intelligence, a one-month course. So that was interesting. That was a precursor to if you wanted to become a teacher, you had to take the Science of Creative Intelligence course at that time. I don't know what it's like right now, but that's what you had to do. So I was interested enough to say, Well, this stuff works great because as my cousins, they learned to meditate, but then they also were attracted to things like, heroin, cocaine, uppers, downers, you name it, they do it. It didn't always work out so great. My cousin Dennis was under the influence of in 1983 when he drowned in the marina in LA. And then Carl, he started smoking when he was about 12. He got a lung cancer about a little over 25 years ago. My cousin Brian is well known for his mental challenges and stuff, but he would take anything and everything.

[00:09:26.980] - Speaker 1
Somebody thought they were turning him on to something great or something. So it just really messed up his head.

[00:09:34.760] - Speaker 2
Did you guys all learn to meditate together?

[00:09:37.750] - Speaker 1
Carl, Alan, and myself, and Dennis, and our wives, Randall were significant others at the time, one from Marishy. I was invited by Marishy. I went to go see him at the Harvard Law Forum in Boston area, in Cambridge, right? In Harvard. And I called this hotel and he picked up the phone. I wanted to talk to somebody with Marisha, but he picked up the phone and said, This is my club Beach Boys. He says, You're coming to India? I said, Are we invited? He said, Yes, come to India. The other guys didn't go, but I did. When I got there, I didn't know before him that the Beatles were all there. Ringo only stayed for a brief time. I don't know, about a week or 10 days or something, but George, John, and Paul stayed for quite a bit longer. George Harris and I both had our birthdays. He on February 25th, I on March 15th, so we're both Pisces. What's your birthday?

[00:10:42.700] - Speaker 2
March 10th, Pisces.

[00:10:45.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah. How about that? Anyway, so we had birthday parties and this and that. The Beatles did a song called the Spiritual Regeneration Movement Foundation. I don't know if you can find it on your phone, but it's pretty- I've never heard that. The Spiritual Regeneration Movement Foundation.

[00:11:04.940] - Speaker 2
Let's see.

[00:11:12.580] - Speaker 1
It's like this fun, fun, fun.

[00:11:44.980] - Speaker 3
A, B, C, D, E, T, H, I, J, Cool, J. A, B, C, C, E, F, T, H, I, J, Cool, J. Like a baby good day, put your children to the back of your house. Good day, good day, good day. Like a baby good day, put your children to the back of your house. Good day, good day, good day. Are you starting your regenerative Actually, what you're hearing right now is John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Star in India in 1968.

[00:12:30.960] - Speaker 2
Wolfman Jack.

[00:12:32.160] - Speaker 1
The song is a tribute to the Maharashi and his philosophy of transcendental meditation.

[00:12:38.920] - Speaker 3
Then it's a special birthday present. The Beatles sang this song for Mike. Michael Lahr, for love.

[00:13:10.130] - Speaker 1
Say it again. Isn't that cool? Happy birthday, Michael Lahr.

[00:13:14.150] - Speaker 3
Happy birthday, Michael Lahr.

[00:13:17.730] - Speaker 2
Michael Lahr?

[00:13:19.320] - Speaker 3
Yeah. So they did that song for my birthday. That was great.

[00:13:34.080] - Speaker 2
Unbelievable. Tell me about the whole indie experience.

[00:13:41.420] - Speaker 1
Well, it was amazing. At that time, Marisha would say, Go and meditate as many hours as you're comfortable. I might meditate for six or eight hours or something. Prudence, dear Prudence, meditate for two or three days. Wow. Yeah, they had to go and get her. She took it very seriously. In fact, she has a doctorate in Sanskret from University of California, Berkeley. I mean, that's Mia Farrow's sister. Mia Farrow was there for a few minutes.

[00:14:10.080] - Speaker 2
Prudence stayed for a long time.

[00:14:11.170] - Speaker 1
She was way into it. She's one of the most prolific TM teachers and has been for many years. She's great. Anyway, it was just fascinating. Meditating for several hours and then having Mahrishee lecture every afternoon and evening, too. So it This is really a fascinating time. I wrote a poem one time. It goes, In the air above the Ganges, 150 down miles from the source of the Holy Mother River, Indian spiritual water. Ripple seen 100 yards below or shining in the sun, reflecting through the eyes of one who feels as though he'd been there, or nearly so, a long, long time ago before the nations rose and beat each other down in which we stand, from which we fallen, feel the need to find the key misplaced through lost time to swing the rusted doors of a world of living around toward the light of nirvana. The key has found it is at hand, and now men call it transidental meditation.

[00:15:11.650] - Speaker 2
Beautiful. You wrote that when you were there.

[00:15:15.710] - Speaker 1
Just looking out over the river, feeling like I had been there before or something.

[00:15:21.340] - Speaker 2
Yeah, beautiful. How long were you there for?

[00:15:24.220] - Speaker 1
About a month and a half.

[00:15:25.230] - Speaker 2
Wow, it's a long time.

[00:15:26.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah, well, it was a three-month thing. Amazing. Marcia said, You can stay and become a teacher and everything will become better after that. I didn't listen, so I left. And I got back and we rehearsed some for a tour we'd set up, mainly in the Mid-South. And we were on the balcony in Nashville when Martin Luther King got shot and killed, and the cities were all burning. And I'm thinking, Maury, she said, If I'd have stayed and become a teacher, we would have missed all that. Well, we had a tour booked, and so I thought that was what we should do.

[00:16:05.130] - Speaker 2
Then have you kept a decent practice over the years?

[00:16:07.660] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Really? I meditate every day. Amazing. If I don't, I'm not a happy person. Yeah. Because I just feel so much better having meditated.Beautiful. Than not.Beautiful. Plus, I dealt with stress. All the stress has been in a group. Of course. My uncle Murray stealing money and recognition for my part of what I did with the Beach Boys, which Brian is brilliant. He'd be able to sit down at the piano and come up with these tremendous chord changes, progressions, and Harmonie Meister. That's amazing. I was more of a lyricsist and conceptual guy. Because we wrote songs together, I'd end up singing the lead because I'd say, Hey, let's do the song about going back to the beach again. It's called Do It Again, right? It went to number one in England, but we were at the end of our tenure at Capital Records, so they didn't try very hard, but it was a pretty big hit. But I would say something like, We did pretty good with Surfing USA, which is paraphrasing Sweet Little 16, Why don't we do rock and roll music? Top five. With all the competition going on, that's pretty good. Yeah.

[00:17:30.890] - Speaker 2
And your very first single was a hit, yes?

[00:17:34.400] - Speaker 1
Surfing was my first single.

[00:17:35.240] - Speaker 2
That was out of the box.

[00:17:36.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it went to number two in LA and number one in Minnesota, just a few places. But it wasn't a nationwide hit. It's not a billboard thing.

[00:17:46.030] - Speaker 2
And it was also just on a little indie label.

[00:17:48.080] - Speaker 1
Exactly. This guy was selling records out of the back of his car. And Russ Regan, who became a very well known head of record companies and stuff, we didn't know what the car sells we called ourselves the Pendletones because of Pendletons. Shirts. Yeah, the surfers all wear them over their T-shirt. So Russ Regan said, Well, it's called surfing. What about the Beach Voice? Said, That's better than what we got. And so it stuck. So the second record going there for Surfing Safari in 1962. We took the photograph for the album cover at Paradise Cove of us on a little truck looking out to Yeah.

[00:18:31.320] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the world in 1961 when you guys started, what was the music scene like?

[00:18:38.380] - Speaker 1
Well, for us, I was listening to all kinds of R&D and blues and stuff like that. I liked the Kingson Trio, too. In fact, Alan and I both like... Al Jarny and I both liked the Kingson Trio. He's the one that sat with Brian and said, Here's the cords. We should do Slip John B, which we did That showed up on the Pet Sounds album. Yeah.

[00:19:02.430] - Speaker 2
And that was a folk song, which was unusual for the Beach Boys.

[00:19:06.460] - Speaker 1
It was unusual, but I liked folk, King's Centriol. Yeah. And Al was into Kingson Trio and other people as well with that genre and Brian did this brilliant track. I think we were in a Japan touring. Brian decided to leave the touring group in November, I think it was, of '64.

[00:19:30.070] - Speaker 2
Right at the beginning, you were banned for three years. Yes.

[00:19:33.130] - Speaker 1
In other words, there were two groups, the Touring Group.

[00:19:38.310] - Speaker 2
And the studio.

[00:19:38.990] - Speaker 1
Which I've always been part of the touring group, and really into promotions and venues and I'd meet with the agency and we'd decide what markets we're going to promote and which markets we'd be out of our minds to try to promote because Ron Delsner would do New York City and Barry Fay would do Colorado and the Belcons would do Cleveland. You'd be out of your fucking mind if you thought you're going to go and do anything in those places because there are these little Feistums or whatever you're calling, where the promoters were.

[00:20:14.400] - Speaker 2
They owned the town.

[00:20:16.040] - Speaker 1
Yes. And they eventually became Live Nation.

[00:20:19.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:20:20.660] - Speaker 1
Nice stock deal there.

[00:20:23.880] - Speaker 2
So you avoided the big promoters and just did outside stuff?

[00:20:28.110] - Speaker 1
No, we didn't avoid the... We did the big promoters where you had to. But there were places that were nearby or en route, too, where you could go in.

[00:20:40.240] - Speaker 2
It was like no man's land.

[00:20:41.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and it wasn't owned by anybody. They were too off to deal with, I guess, maybe.

[00:20:46.620] - Speaker 2
No, but that's cool because that was real grassroots. Totally.

[00:20:50.910] - Speaker 1
It was very cool. In fact, Kenton and Akron, there were two theaters. There was a theater in each one. We did two shows a day here and two shows a day there. We'd go back and forth. It's like maybe 70 miles. Wow.

[00:21:05.200] - Speaker 2
So the same day.

[00:21:06.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah. But we'd have an opening act like we did Buffalo Springfield. Amazing. Yeah. There was one time in Alabama where the Rolling Stones were in their first tour of the US, and they came out and they did their thing, and we came on after them. And I said, That was pretty good. I said, But I think it's time to stand up for Alabama, which is a state motto, which I knew because I had a great, great grandfather, according to the family Bible, that was a sheriff in Alabama before the Civil War.

[00:21:41.050] - Speaker 2
Wow, going way back.

[00:21:42.470] - Speaker 1
That had to be a very colorful profession at that time.

[00:21:47.960] - Speaker 2
Are you the only Beachboy to have played at every Beachboy show in history?

[00:21:54.590] - Speaker 1
I actually missed about 10 of them one year.

[00:21:57.840] - Speaker 2
And what was the cause of that?

[00:22:00.450] - Speaker 1
It was a bit of exhaustion. Yeah. But the exhaustion was exacerbated by the fact that I decided I was going to fast. I saw. I was going through a divorce situation with the mother of two of my kids, Haley. And Christian. Christian sings with us now in the group, and he does a fantastic job on God only knows his perfect voice. He's similar timbre to Carl Wilson, which is a phenomenal singer.Unbelievable.Yeah.Beautiful voice.

[00:22:30.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Did the lead on Good Vibrations, lead on God only knows, lead on Darlin, some really great songs. So anyway, I was going through this divorce. Not that I wanted to, but she was doing stuff that wanted to be free. That was Timothy Leary, tune in, turn on, and drop out. So that works out for some people, okay. Some people do 100 acid chips and be fine. Other people makes them crazy or they think they can fly. But once I learned meditation, I said, well, first of all, my throat is not dry, and I don't feel hungover or sketchy after a while, so you have to get high again. I feel clearer and I'm relaxed. And I just made the decision to just stay with that rather than all the other stuff because there was weirdness going on.

[00:23:25.740] - Speaker 2
Do you do it first thing in the morning when you wake up?

[00:23:28.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I shower and usually I meditate first thing. Unless we're going to make a plane, and then I'll meditate on the plane.

[00:23:37.040] - Speaker 2
Planes are great to meditate. You could do long ones.

[00:23:39.580] - Speaker 1
I think so.

[00:23:40.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah, the time just passes.

[00:23:41.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:23:43.660] - Speaker 2
Tell me about what motivates related to fasting. You said you were going through a hard time, and that's an interesting choice.

[00:23:50.320] - Speaker 1
If you read the Old Testament, and the Thussle, and all these guys, they would fast for 40 days, 40 nights. I said, okay, so why don't I try that. I think it was an escape from the reality of having to go through this thing, which I didn't really want to go through. And I didn't been meditating. I was thinking, two beautiful kids and stuff, and I said, this isn't cool. So I think it was a reaction to maybe that will help me cope with or comprehend what was going on. So I did it for about the first week. I just did juice, tea, and water. That was it for three weeks. But it made me so sensitive that and wired at the same time. So I took a few days off. Brian actually had been... That was something like around 1969. So Brian had been off of touring for a couple of years, but he came back and subbed for me for a while.

[00:24:53.380] - Speaker 2
That's really interesting.

[00:24:54.820] - Speaker 1
But that was the only time that I ever missed.

[00:24:56.840] - Speaker 2
That's interesting, though, that he came back to sub for you. It's very interesting. But did it always feel like it was the family band, like your family with the Wilsons and Al?

[00:25:11.780] - Speaker 1
It was Brian's friend.

[00:25:13.070] - Speaker 2
Brian's friend? Yeah. So what the high school leader. Did it always feel like a family operation pretty much the whole time?

[00:25:22.830] - Speaker 1
Well, it absolutely was. Matter of fact, the first time I remember Brian singing was on Grandma Wilson's lap singing Anyboy when he was maybe 10. Wow. So it might have been 11. My mom was a Wilson, Emily Lee Wilson. She was sister to Murray Wilson, who was Brian Denniscarle's father. It was all about music in a Wilson situation. The brothers would sing in a quartet. My mom sang in high school trio, Madam Butterfly in a light opera. She would wake us up to go to school to opera music, Maria Callas, Romanda Tabalti, and that was incredible to have them to wake up in the morning, that will get you out of the house. But if we turned on the hi-fi set to even halfway on rock and roll, that was a bad thing, according to her. Anyway, every birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas, you name it, we would get together musically, and we would We literally rehearse Christmas carols. If we walked by the Coleman's house, they were Jewish, we would lay something white on them like Jingle Bells. Then we'd do a little town of Bethlehem down the street. It was always about music.

[00:26:50.630] - Speaker 2
It sounds like always about harmony because the hymns were harmony. Exactly.

[00:26:55.450] - Speaker 1
Brian and I, my sister Maureen, who played harp on a couple of our early records, We would go to Wednesday night, youth night at Angeles Mesa Presbyterian Church and sing the songs they had to sing there. Then on the way home, we'd do three-part harmony in our Everly Brothers.

[00:27:11.840] - Speaker 2
What does it feel like when you're singing harmony with other people with good voices and you find your part? Tell me what that experience is.

[00:27:20.990] - Speaker 1
Well, it's not only the parts, but as you know, it's the blend. The thing that distinguishes the Beach voice musically from so many other groups is sing harmonies. They can sing two parts, they can sing three parts, some, a few sing four parts. But it's the blend in addition to singing the part. So the idea was that we sing with many people over the years. I mean, because Brian and Carl and myself could blend really well together. Dennis, not so much. His voice was rougher. It was fine for a lead, but it didn't blend like that beautiful celestial blend that the Beach Boys were known for. Alan jardine could blend. Yeah. And so right now we have a guy who's our musical director for our live band, who was 18 years with the four freshmen. Wow. The recent incarnation, obviously not the originals, but those guys were amazing in terms of their blend and the fantastic harmonies that they did. We did this filming of a get together at Paradise Cove for the documentary we, the Disney Plus, just did. The new documentary. We sang The Heart's Full of Spring, four parts right there on the beach.

[00:28:41.820] - Speaker 1
Wow. Yeah, it wasn't in the documentary, but we did that. I like to sing some other songs, too. Surfing Safari. The Heart's Full of Spring, though, was four parts acapella. No track, no nothing.

[00:28:54.510] - Speaker 2
When you sing together, do you feel it become one thing? Yeah.

[00:29:00.190] - Speaker 1
That's the beauty of the blend. You sublimate your individuality to create the group sound.

[00:29:07.490] - Speaker 2
Do you discuss in advance when to breathe?

[00:29:10.750] - Speaker 1
That comes naturally, I think, according to how the song structure. I always sing the bass part, the lower part. I don't have volume, but I have resonance.

[00:29:22.440] - Speaker 2
I imagine you have to sing it the same way every time because otherwise, the parts won't work. You basically learn your part and you play part exactly right, and everyone does it together.

[00:29:32.490] - Speaker 1
You can't be fucking around. Some people think, Well, can't you pick up musicians to play? Can't do that. No, our songs are so structured. In order to do them well, you have to replicate them as close to the record recording as possible.

[00:29:52.760] - Speaker 2
Someone said it in the documentary about comparing the Beach Boys and the Beatles. Someone said, We were singers, they were players. I thought that was a really interesting, astute way to look at it. I think it's really accurate. You guys started as singers and then became the band, but you always sang together.

[00:30:17.040] - Speaker 1
We always sang together family style. Then when we made the first record, it was a snare drum, a stand-up bass, and a guitar. That's it. That was the track. So You're right, we were singers, and other people were playing their ass off since they were 10 years old or whatever.

[00:30:35.860] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and it really is apples and oranges. It's an interesting way to think about it. Did you feel like you had peers making music, or did you feel you were on an island doing your own thing?

[00:30:48.830] - Speaker 1
That's a really interesting question. Probably the mamas and papas might have been a peer.

[00:30:56.540] - Speaker 2
They were great.

[00:30:57.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and they had harmonies. Yes. They didn't have the blend we had. No. They definitely had great music and harmonies. They had something. Great songs. I mean, the lyrics, come on, California Dream.Unbelievable.That's fucking a great song.Monday, Monday. We do our own version. We did a video of it in a church and I stopped along the way. I stopped in a church, I passed along the way. I got down on my knees, I'd pretend to pray. It's fucking great lyrics. The preacher likes the cold. He knows I'm going to stay. Yeah. Great song. John Phillips. Yeah.

[00:31:33.580] - Speaker 2
Did you know him?

[00:31:35.310] - Speaker 1
Yes. In fact, the Melody of Cocomo, which is said to be our biggest hit single, the Melody of the Verses was by John Phillips. Off the floor are the keys. There's a place called Cocomo. That's where we used to go to get away from it all. That's what he wrote. I said, Hold on. That's where we used to go. Sounds like some old guy lamenting his lost youth. That's where you want to go. That opens it up to- Aspirational. Yes. And so that's my only contribution to the first verse. But then I came up Aruba, Jamaica, who I'm going to take a Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama, killarga, Montigo, baby, why don't we go? So I came up the chorus because the melody, as sweet as it was, it didn't have a groove to it. So I came up, I did the R&B thing. And you know what? The impulse of that is Smoky Joe's Cafe. That's Smoky Joe's Cafe. Aruba, Jamaica, oh, I want to take it. Dope right back in the R&B groove, which is what I listened to constantly when I was in high school.

[00:32:50.030] - Speaker 2
Did you like Do-up as well?

[00:32:51.960] - Speaker 1
I love it. Barbara Ann was Do-up, right? Yeah.

[00:32:56.770] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the album that has Barbara Ann on it. Like Acoustic guitar. It is. I love that album.

[00:33:03.230] - Speaker 1
It's our party album. We didn't even see of it being a hit, but the promotion man for the East Coast for Capital Records took it off the album and got it played in Worcester, Mass And then I got it played in Boston, and it got it played everywhere. It became a significant hit for us.

[00:33:20.630] - Speaker 2
It's a great song.

[00:33:21.950] - Speaker 1
In January, it came out with us in late '65 because we needed to do something to give us more time to develop the Pet Sounds album like Brian wanted to do. He needed more time to do all those great tracks with all the Wrecking Crew guys and stuff like that. So I suggested, let's do a party album and just take a bunch of the songs we'd like doing. So we did a Beatles song, a Bob Dylan song, and Barbara Ann was among those songs. Yeah.

[00:33:55.200] - Speaker 2
Such a great... I love that album.

[00:33:56.840] - Speaker 1
It's just fun. We're just doing a bunch of I was like, why?

[00:34:00.440] - Speaker 2
But you can feel the spontaneous camaraderie. You feel the fun.

[00:34:07.760] - Speaker 1
The camaraderie was Dean Torrance, who was with Jen and Dean. They did Surf City, right? Yeah. He came to the session and sang the high part was Brian. So we had two totally great falsettos on that.

[00:34:20.640] - Speaker 2
Did Brian always sing falsetto? From the beginning?

[00:34:25.040] - Speaker 1
He could hit... You'd probably listen to the lead of Don't Worry Baby. Yeah.unbelievable.unbelievable. What a great... What a great.

[00:34:32.930] - Speaker 2
Even before the Beach Boys, when you guys would sing together, he would always sing Harmp?

[00:34:37.710] - Speaker 1
He would sing the high part. Always. For a freshman, he would sing the high part. I'd sing the little part. Then Carla would sing her, and I would sing her.

[00:34:47.660] - Speaker 2
Would you guys sing Everly Brothers songs, too?

[00:34:49.920] - Speaker 1
Oh, absolutely. Loved the Everly Brothers. Amazing. So did the Beatles, too. It's interesting. It was similar inspirations for both of us, Chuck Berry and Everly Brothers. That's two-thirds of 100% right there. That's enough. That was the Beach Boys. Fun, fun, fun is Chuck Berry. The concept was every kid wants to borrow the car and go cruising. So the girl tells her, Dad, I'm going to go to the library. But she has other plans, actually. It's just a vignette of whatever was going on at that age when you got your driver's license, you want to cruise.

[00:35:37.260] - Speaker 2
What was the first car song, the first Hot Rod song you guys did? Do you remember?

[00:35:41.380] - Speaker 1
409.

[00:35:42.700] - Speaker 2
Great record.

[00:35:43.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah. We had what you call double-sided hits there for a while because they would play Surfing Safari, and then they'd turn it over and play 409. That went over really well in a lot of parts of the country where they didn't know from surfing or anything. All over the Midwest and the South, Four or Nine, Shut Down, Little Deuce Coup, I get around. Great. Fun, fun, fun. Great songs. Oh, yeah. I was involved in the lyrics of all those songs, except Deuce Coup. I didn't do anything. That was a guy named Roger Christian, who as a DJ in LA, who was a gearhead.

[00:36:19.570] - Speaker 2
So cool. What do you remember about the Pet Sounds era?

[00:36:27.060] - Speaker 1
I remember doing the song Wouldn't It Be eyes, and we would do this one pass. This is one section, maybe 25, 28 times. And I started calling Brian dog ears because he heard shit that no other human being would because he wanted to do it again. I said, It was perfect. Why do we have to do this again? He says, No, I just want just looking for a different feel or something. So we do it again. We did that a lot with the several of the songs that called for the backgrounds to be perfect. And there's a box set of the Pet Sounds album where they just have the tracks, and there's one CD that has just the vocals. And you listen to that and it says, Oh, boy.

[00:37:11.590] - Speaker 2
You understand why. Yeah.

[00:37:13.320] - Speaker 1
It's unbelievable. And you listen in the tracks, I said, Who the fuck came up with those woodwinds like that? Brian. There's some stuff that doesn't make sense. I mean, he didn't have to go that far, did he? He just did.

[00:37:28.200] - Speaker 2
It's so beautiful.

[00:37:28.990] - Speaker 1
He was brilliant at that point in time.

[00:37:31.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah, so beautiful. You guys have put out either box sets or repackages that are extensive and amazing. There was one a couple of years ago of Surfs Up. It's mind I listened to it a thousand times.

[00:37:48.020] - Speaker 1
Come on, really?

[00:37:48.620] - Speaker 2
Seriously. It's hours and hours of music.

[00:37:51.130] - Speaker 1
The master is listening.

[00:37:52.950] - Speaker 2
No, it's hours and hours of music, but it's so beautiful. How did the idea come to start doing these Expanded. The idea is, well, the thing is there are a lot of albums that came out at a period of time where we weren't selling very much product, and yet the feeling was that there's a lot of good stuff on some of those albums, like the Holland album and Surfs Up album, stuff like that.

[00:38:22.770] - Speaker 1
So why not repackage them, put them out? And they've been remastered and different things. So it gives person a chance, if they're interested, into diving a little deeper into stuff that wasn't as well known. Yeah. Like, for instance, our Sounds of Summer album sold about four million copies in the US, which is pretty good. This is the 50th anniversary of the Endless Summer album, which came out in 1974. That's fucking amazing to have a 50th anniversary of a album that came out in 1974. Of a Greatest Tits. We're doing about 17 of the songs, the 20 songs on the double album.

[00:38:59.870] - Speaker 2
Yeah, Tell me the story of the Endless Summer album. Because I remember when it came out, it felt like it renewed the Beach Boys.

[00:39:06.950] - Speaker 1
It did. It absolutely, fucking literally did, because Endless Summer, the same album came out in Great Britain. It was called 20 Golden Greats and sold a million copies of a double album LP in Great Britain. That's a lot. A lot. It was like one every other house or something. The thing is, they were songs that were done on Capitol Records. We were all After that contract ended, we were with Reprise, Mo Austin, and that thing. And then we did a couple of years of CBS. But they took all these songs and put them together, and they were going to call it the Best of the Beach Boys, volume 2 or three or something. I said, there is no such a thing. I said, let's call it Endless Summer. After the Bruce Brown's movie, The Endless Summer, I'm thinking, surfing songs, Endless Summer. It's not a best of. It's a new album to people who don't know of the Beach Boys.

[00:40:08.850] - Speaker 2
It's a concept album, really.

[00:40:10.400] - Speaker 1
It's a concept album that is new to the new record-aware person in, which there are millions. Between '60 to '74, there are millions of people that got into music. They were out of grade school or junior high or high school. Now they're really into it.

[00:40:28.190] - Speaker 2
Music changed over those years a Yes. It felt new again.

[00:40:32.720] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, what's really amazing is we'll do those songs in concert, and they'll be children, preteens, teens, young adults, and great grandparents They all enjoy the music together as a one big happy family, which is fantastic. That's a really neat thing to see is the happiness that those songs evoke. We did a festival on the beach in Wildwood, New Jersey, last summer. And this guy comes up to me afterwards backstage, and he says, My dad and I bonded over your music. My dad lost my dad in January of this year. And so being here at that concert, you playing those songs, was like an emotional experience for me. That goes on these days by the millions because people played our music as these kids were growing up and going to college and whatever they did. And the parents move on, literally. And that was something like in our family, singing together and harmonizing with the multiple generations got us started. And that whole vibe continues on in a mega-type way with people all over the world. Amazing. Yeah.

[00:41:57.750] - Speaker 2
Over the years, how much did you guys play outside of the US?

[00:42:01.640] - Speaker 1
Quite a bit. We and the Beatles were for foreign groups, we were right up there in Germany. In England, we did really well. We even had the number one album in Spain, which is repackage and stuff. We had fan letters from Russia, fan letters from China. I met a real estate agent from Iran who said, We play your LPs at whatever the sea that they went to during the summer I mean, so I had the Saudi ambassador of the United States in 1977, was it? In Washington, DC, tell me that he had our cassettes in his Austin Healey when he was going to college in England. That was the ambassador from Saudi Arabia. So you got people from all around the world and all these places that were not exactly perceived perceived as friendly to the United States that have been fans of the Beach Boys.

[00:43:05.320] - Speaker 2
It always was perceived as American music, not even just American music, California music. It really was the sound of California.

[00:43:16.870] - Speaker 1
There's a lot of people wanting to come to California because of those songs.

[00:43:22.540] - Speaker 2
Tell me, over the history of the band from the beginning, what's the first gig you remember doing ever?

[00:43:27.430] - Speaker 1
New Year's Eve, December 31st, First, 1961, our song, Surfing, had been a decent-size hit in California at that time. On the show was the Rivingtons with Papa Umaumau, and Ike Turner and the Kings of Rhythm featuring the Ikeets. Tina Turner did this song, I'm Blue, Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo, and she was primordial. Blue in my mind. That was Tina Turner was one of the I Kets.

[00:44:04.080] - Speaker 2
Is there a recording of that song? I've never heard that song.

[00:44:06.230] - Speaker 1
Oh, no? Oh, sure. There's a recording. I'm Blue. I'm Blue.

[00:44:10.190] - Speaker 2
Let's listen to it. Okay. I love listening to music.

[00:44:13.290] - Speaker 1
She was just It's just unbelievable. Live. Oh, my God. Ladies and gentlemen, greet my friends, if you will.

[00:44:21.990] - Speaker 2
These are the I Kets.

[00:44:48.700] - Speaker 1
That's Taylor.

[00:44:50.180] - Speaker 3
I want to tell her all you, you, you, you, you, you I'm in the well hoping you would come back soon. I couldn't believe what I had. But what you tell her, told me my love if you were soon. I hope her reading was wrong. I hope she was wrong for you've been gone too long, long, long. Hey. Dung, dung, dung, dung, dung, dung, yeah. I'm just, doof, doof, doof, doof, doof, I can't sleep at night for thinking of you. Every night about to find love for you. Come, come, come, down. I can't stand being here alone. I'm I know you're in the fumbling, but you ain't no way around. I hope we're meeting once more. I hope she was wrong for two been done too long, come on. Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah. I do, do, do, do, do Incredible. Yeah.

[00:46:43.770] - Speaker 2
That was unbelievable.

[00:46:46.440] - Speaker 1
Imagine to sing it, hearing them live with the Kings of Rhythm and like...

[00:46:51.630] - Speaker 2
Wow. So that was your first show?

[00:46:53.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that blew my mind. And we only had three songs. I said, This is pretty good. Five hundred bucks, three songs for 60 bucks each or something like that. I don't know. We went back about 10 years later with made in the many thousands. It was an improvement.

[00:47:12.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah. How many people were at that show? Do you remember?

[00:47:15.280] - Speaker 1
Maybe a thousand.

[00:47:16.460] - Speaker 2
A thousand. That's a pretty big show for a first show.

[00:47:18.770] - Speaker 1
It was Richie Vallon's Memorial Dance & Show.

[00:47:26.360] - Speaker 2
So up until this point, surf music had been purely instrumental. Correct.

[00:47:33.180] - Speaker 1
The Ventures and Dick Dale, Nadal Tones. How many years would you say surf music was around? Two or three? Yeah, that's it.

[00:47:42.220] - Speaker 2
Pretty new sound. Yeah, it was.

[00:47:44.930] - Speaker 1
It was guitar-driven, which is great.

[00:47:48.560] - Speaker 2
Do you know if surf music was big all over the country, or was it mainly a Southern California thing?

[00:47:52.640] - Speaker 1
I don't know about all over the country, but it was big in Japan. The ventures did really well in Japan. That's interesting. They still Traveling out the original guys, they're not around anymore.

[00:48:03.650] - Speaker 2
How did the idea come to sing about surfing?

[00:48:08.350] - Speaker 1
My cousin Dennis and I, we'd go fishing or we'd go to the Ruegando Beach, and They're the surfers and the ho-dads, meaning they're the people that wore the Pendleton shirts and the T-shirts and the jeans and stuff and talked a certain way, had a certain lingo. If the waves are up to cut class and go to the beach, that thing. And so on the record, surfing, I got up this morning, turned on the radio. I was checking out the surf and sing to see if I would go in when the DJ tells me that the surfing is fine. That's when I know my baby and I will have a good time going surfing. Bum, bum, di, di, di, di. So, yeah, which is a little R&B, a Bum, bum, di, di, di, di, song about going surfing, which became a phenomenal thing. Then Surfing Safari followed that up. Then Surfing USA was really number one or something. I would look at the foreign charts and billboard. We had Surfing USA would be in the top 10 in Israel or South America or Australia or Norway, Sweden or Denmark, that I think. It's pretty fascinating to see our music from California showing up worldwide.

[00:49:35.870] - Speaker 2
Amazing. And surfing was still a pretty new thing. And there weren't millions of surfers in the world. There were probably thousands. Yes. It was a small subculture Sure.

[00:49:45.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's for damn sure.

[00:49:46.680] - Speaker 2
Probably you guys did more to spread surfing than anyone else, because even in places where there weren't waves, they could listen to your music.

[00:49:55.030] - Speaker 1
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And there's T-shirts of Surf, Ohio. There's this guy that just took it upon himself to do a Surf Ohio shirt, which he's been doing that for 40 years or more. Wow. Yeah.

[00:50:10.890] - Speaker 2
If you look at the history of the band, do you think of it in chapters?

[00:50:14.880] - Speaker 1
Well, there's definitely the original band. Then when Brian decided to go and not do the touring, but stay and do the recording, and producing, recording, arranging, and all that that comes along that, there became two bands. So I don't know if you call it chapters, but it was just two bands. Then we've had different changes in the live band over the years. The most success we had, a record I think in the '60s was good vibrations. I don't think there's any question about that. Pet Sounds was great. However, the record company didn't know how to promote it. It wasn't received as well in the marketplace. But with people who are musicians or producers or anything to do with writers or anything to listen to the album, I said, Wow, that's pretty cool.

[00:51:11.200] - Speaker 2
Now it's considered one of the top albums in the history of music Music.

[00:51:15.760] - Speaker 1
Rolling Stone magazine did a thing maybe 20 years ago, the top 500 albums of all time. Number one was Sergeant Pepper. Number two was Pet Sounds. Amazing. That ain't bad. It's a pretty good company.

[00:51:29.660] - Speaker 2
Not bad.

[00:51:30.270] - Speaker 1
One and two, right up there on the top of 500 albums, which is pretty amazing. Now, everybody has their own taste and appreciation of music, so it's going to vary, I think, according to what group of people you're going to... I mean, I think Marvin Gay was coming pretty high with a group of people who listen to his music. I don't think we've ever sold as many singles as some people have, like Three Dog Night, Joy to the World, several million copies. Great song. Yeah. Credence Clearwater had some amazing singles. They would do more numbers, I think, but we did okay. We had, what, 40 top I don't know how many top 40 records.

[00:52:18.800] - Speaker 2
You talk about being the studio band and they're being the live band. We think of that as being unusual for the Beach Boys, but if you think about it, the Wrecking Crew played on the Birds albums, Simon & Garfunkle.

[00:52:32.520] - Speaker 1
Mom's and Papa's.

[00:52:33.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, most of the things that were coming out of California. Even the Specter stuff. Yeah, the Phil Specter. They were the California house band for pretty much everybody.

[00:52:42.960] - Speaker 1
They were, yeah. Huge.

[00:52:46.640] - Speaker 2
I think the main difference was Brian deciding not to go on the road is the thing that was unusual. But actually, he got to spend all the time working on the music, which was beneficial to you guys. It was unusual, but it worked out.

[00:53:01.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was. And Glenn Campbell took his place for a few months.

[00:53:04.830] - Speaker 2
And he was incredible.

[00:53:06.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah. He was one of the greatest guitar players ever. Yes. And a self-taught from Arkansas.

[00:53:13.720] - Speaker 2
Could sing.

[00:53:14.630] - Speaker 1
He could sing his ass off, which obviously became very famous and did all those great songs about Phoenix and MacArthur's Park and all that stuff. Yeah.

[00:53:25.320] - Speaker 2
How did the band change when Dennis passed away?

[00:53:30.620] - Speaker 1
Well, the Dennis situation was a drag because he would go into rehab for one night. It doesn't work that way. And so he couldn't get up off the self-medication, I guess, the drugs or the alcohol We had a road manager had to flush heroine down the toilet when we went into New Zealand one year because they don't look kindly towards importation of those types of drugs in New Zealand. In Singapore, they have importation of drugs is punishable by death. That's a deterrent for some people. I don't think McCartney would have taken his weed to Singapore. Yeah.

[00:54:14.480] - Speaker 2
Didn't he go to jail in Japan?

[00:54:16.650] - Speaker 1
In Japan, yeah. Wow. Yeah, he actually spent time in Japan.

[00:54:21.530] - Speaker 2
What was it like at that period of the band anyway? Was it difficult with Dennis' proclivities?

[00:54:28.780] - Speaker 1
It was. It was rough because we'd have to tell him, no, you can't come around here anymore. And so we had to get other people to play the drums.

[00:54:40.430] - Speaker 2
So there were times where you would ask him not to come on tour?

[00:54:43.320] - Speaker 1
Correct. Yeah, because he'd be drunk.

[00:54:47.120] - Speaker 2
Couldn't do it. Yeah. Couldn't do his gig.

[00:54:49.190] - Speaker 1
And that's not right. Everybody else is doing their part, and he's not able to. It's not that we wanted to do that. No, of course. It's just we had to do that. Of course. To protect the group. Yeah.

[00:55:03.470] - Speaker 2
Was Karl a steady force in the band over the years?

[00:55:09.430] - Speaker 1
For the most part. He went through some times where he was involved in some of those things he shouldn't have been. But he got up off of that and was a very stable force in the group. He was the band leader, musically speaking. Yeah. And I I was always in promotions and figuring out where we're going to tour and what markets like I alluded to earlier. So it was a good partnership because I knew that the songs were going to be perfectly played and sang. And I was able to commit a lot of time to songwriting and guiding the group in terms of the one-nighters and stuff. Somebody gave me an award in Troy this last summer saying that we've done over 6000 shows or something like that, the most of anybody. We like what we do. I like doing these smaller theaters because they sound great, they look great. Economically, they're not as big as the amphitheaters and the festivals. There's huge festivals nowadays. We did Stage Coach, and there's 80,000 people, they say, at our concert. The Stage Coach sold out, which is a huge festival, sold out in advance, which is an amazing thing.

[00:56:32.970] - Speaker 2
After Endless Summer, you guys were playing huge shows again. Yeah, did very well.

[00:56:37.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:56:39.080] - Speaker 2
Tell me from the peaks and valleys of the size of audiences you've played to over the years. Just tell me the roller coaster ride.

[00:56:48.410] - Speaker 1
We always try to do the best shows we can, no matter what the size and stuff. Of course. I really don't identify so much which are bigger on the smaller shows, except to say that in July fourth, in the mid '80s, we did these shows in Philadelphia and Washington, DC. We're in Philadelphia on a July fourth, the Philadelphia Enquiry said we had 900,000 people on the streets of Philadelphia in front of where Sylvester Sloan had his statue. And then that was the afternoon. And the evening was Washington, DC, with over a half a million people.

[00:57:29.740] - Speaker 2
And those It would be on television, I remember. Yes. Amazing. How did those come about?

[00:57:34.320] - Speaker 1
I came up with the idea.

[00:57:35.640] - Speaker 2
It's a great idea.

[00:57:36.350] - Speaker 1
I said, look, the United States has been good to us. The least we can do is celebrate July fourth and do a free concert. A free concert is anything but free in terms of the cost of putting it on. So we had Amway one year came up with a few hundred thousand dollars for the sound, the lights, the staging, all the transportation for all the different acts and stuff, because we wouldn't do just the Beach Boys, although we headlined, we knew we weren't the only music out there. So we had the OJs one year. We had Joan Jett one year. We had Hank Jr. One year, we even had Julio Iglesias sing Surfer Girl with us. We did the backgrounds for an album he did called Bel Air or something. He did an album, and we sang The Air That I Breathe, which is...

[00:58:27.400] - Speaker 2
Great song.

[00:58:28.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's nice. And We were playing some of our songs in the studio, and he said, Who did these songs? Brian and I did those songs. He was impressed. We got him to sing Surfer Girl with us, and he did one of the songs from his album as well. We introduced him to over half a million people.

[00:58:52.040] - Speaker 2
Tell me about each band member. From childhood, tell me about each guy.

[00:58:58.200] - Speaker 1
Okay, well, Dennis never touched the drum set before he started, but he learned the drums right off the bat, which was great. And he wasn't Jeana Krupa, but he did a two and four down, went boom, boom. He was good. A lot of energy and charisma and stuff. The girl loved him. Alan Jardine was the one who played rhythm guitar. Carl Wilson played lead guitar. For a while, Alan left the group after surfing. We signed Surfing Safari with a fellow named David David Marks, who played rhythm guitar, and Carl played lead. So it was Brian, Dennis, and Carl, Mike, and David Marks, who signed the Capital Records contract. And David was with us for about four albums. And then my uncle Murray didn't like the fact that his parents, he was only 14 or 15 at the time while you're doing this. And his parents were very watchful for him. And my uncle Murray didn't like that because he wanted to have his way with his group. We fired Uncle Murray, Brian and I did. His way of getting even with me was because he was administrating the publishing, and he didn't put my name as writer on Help Me, Rhonda, I Get Around.

[01:00:19.920] - Speaker 2
All the songs you read the words.

[01:00:21.140] - Speaker 1
He, True to your School, Little Saint nick. Surfing USA was the biggest rip off of it all.

[01:00:26.710] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the conversation you and Brian had deciding to fire Murray. That's a big deal because he's Brian's dad.

[01:00:33.640] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was not easy. But Brian wanted to do his music a certain way, and his father would come in and say, Oh, do a different way.

[01:00:43.450] - Speaker 2
He was getting in the way. Yeah.

[01:00:44.270] - Speaker 1
He was interfering with the sound that Brian was hearing that he wanted to put on record. And so it became a conflict creatively. In addition to, Brian was not a very nice, friendly guy. So we did, in fact, fire him as our manager, but he hung on to the publishing.

[01:01:07.960] - Speaker 2
And he sold it. Do you remember the conversation where you guys fired him? Yeah.

[01:01:12.890] - Speaker 1
What was it like? It was tough. It was not fun, but we just told them flat out, we want to go our own direction, basically, and we don't think you understand or are capable of letting us do what we want to do. So It was a decision that had to be made in order to do the records that we quickly thereafter did.

[01:01:41.030] - Speaker 2
When you were starting, the different members of the band, how were people's tastes the same and how is it different?

[01:01:49.180] - Speaker 1
Well, as I mentioned earlier, Alan Jardine really liked the folk music. Brian fell in love with the four freshmen. He would sit at the piano for hours and break down those harmonies. And so he would have those harmonies in his head. Here's the bass, here's the notes above that and the middle two parts, and he would sing the high part. So He would sit at the piano and break it all down. And he had that amazing falsetto. He had a great lead in natural voice, too. Carl, of course, Carl had a beautiful voice. It could blend with the best of them and a great lead. He did Wild Honey and Darlin and Good Vibrations leads, stuff, gommeling those. So he was absolutely amazing. Al sang Weedon, Help Me, Rhonda, which went to number one. I wrote the lyrics, and Brian did the preponderence of the music. We worked on the harmonies together. Dennis has his own style and on the type of music and stuff that he did. It was quite emotional. In fact, John Stamos, our actor friend, chose to do the song Dennis wrote called Forever on the episode where Uncle Jesse got married on the full house, and we backed him up on Forever.

[01:03:23.880] - Speaker 1
If he comes out and does concerts with us, which he likes to do, we back him up, and he sings that song. People love it.

[01:03:33.490] - Speaker 2
How would you decide who would sing lead on a song?

[01:03:37.790] - Speaker 1
Often it was the range of the song. And of course, I don't have a particularly high voice. But if Brian and I wrote a song together, quite often I would end up singing the lead. Brian had a period where he didn't get out of bed very often. He was just isolated. Related. And so I went over to his house one day, and this was regarding Do It Again, 1968. I took him down on the beach, walked around a little bit, came back. I remember going back to my house and sitting at the piano in about 15, 20 minutes. We had that song carved out. It came up with the concept, wrote the lyrics, sang the lead. He did the track along with Carl and stuff. At the studio we'd put in his house in Bel Air. So we didn't want a mountain. At that point in time, it wasn't a good idea to have a mountain, Hollywood in the streets. He would stop people in Bel Air, stop cars and ask him if he could borrow a cigarette. Wow. Yeah, he was doing a lot of cocaine.

[01:04:51.720] - Speaker 2
Do you think bringing him to the beach sparked the inspiration for the song?

[01:04:56.850] - Speaker 1
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. We I got on the piano and came up with it in no time and recorded it. Like I said, I went to number one in England, which was good. I mean, not as high in the US because we were at the end of our tenure there, and they weren't trying too hard with us. But they tried okay in '74 in the summer album. It came back around.

[01:05:22.660] - Speaker 2
Tell me more about writing lyrics about any times you can think of where you would have the concept in advance, let's say?

[01:05:31.920] - Speaker 1
The concept in advance. We did a show at a place called the Lagoon, which is a place in Salt Lake City, which is a theme park. We were very popular there. We did a show to open the season, one in the middle of the season, and a show to close the season. So for a couple of years there, we'd go three times a year, all during the summer. And so this one time we played and I said to Brian, We got to do a song about a girl who borrows her dad's car and says she's going to go to the library, but in fact, she goes cruising. That was the birth of Fun, Fun, Fun. So and I said, It's got to start with the Chuck Berry style of guitar intro. So Carl did... So that was the case of the concept came before the song. And then Brian got busy with Carl in the studio and came up with the track and I sang the lyrics. I finished up the lyrics, sang them, and he did that amazing falsetto part at the end, which was mind-blown. I always thought that was a fantastic part.

[01:06:46.390] - Speaker 1
So there's that. Then another time, November 1964, it was November 22nd or so. He had moved out his family home because contentious between his dad and himself and stuff. So he rented a house not too far away, a couple of months away. And I went and joined him for a songwriting session. He came up with this beautiful melody, a haunting melody. And I came up with the lyrics to a song called The Wormth of the Sun, which is a really beautiful ballad. And we probably stopped writing it about 2:00 in the morning. And the next day, we were waking that President Kennedy had been taken to the hospital in Dallas. Yeah. So it was when we were writing it, he had to have been in Dallas. It was early morning hours, the last day he was alive. And so it was an eerie feeling in that music. What I got out of the feeling of it was the loss of some love, meaning you were in love with somebody, they didn't feel the same way anymore. Maybe they had it one time, but you didn't feel it anymore. So it was never going to happen.

[01:08:09.840] - Speaker 1
And yet, in spite of the fact that it really drewed up terrible disappointing feelings, at least you had felt that euphoria that comes along with that feeling of being in love. And so that was trying to take a negative and look at it positively. So I wrote lyrics to go with the mood and the feeling of it. And we didn't change any lyrics because of what happened. We've recorded about a month later, but the emotion was there. Wow. Yeah.

[01:08:46.070] - Speaker 2
Let's listen to that song.

[01:08:47.770] - Speaker 1
I love that song. The warmth of the Sun.

[01:08:49.190] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

[01:08:59.920] - Speaker 3
What good is the dawn that grows in today? The sunset at night, or live in this way? For I am the warmth of the sun. Within me at night. Within me at night, At night, the love of my love, she lift me one day. I cried when she said, I don't feel the same way. Still, I am the warmth of the sun. The warmth of the sun. Within me too now. Within me too now. I'll dream on her arms and who then I'd read. Just like she still there, the way that I feel. My love's like the Incredible song.

[01:11:45.860] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's beautiful. Incredible song. Yeah. What do you remember about recording that?

[01:11:51.310] - Speaker 1
Just that it was done January 1 of '65. Wow.

[01:11:57.610] - Speaker 2
When you would do the harmony vocals, would all of you stand around one mic?

[01:12:01.790] - Speaker 1
How would you do it typically? I would be on my own mic. The other guys would be on their mic if it's doing backgrounds. Whoever's going to do a lead, that's the- Would the lead happen at the same time, too? I think what we did was, in that case, I think we did the backgrounds, then they did the lead. Backgrounds first. I think that's what I recall.

[01:12:20.440] - Speaker 2
Would it typically be the case on a song where there would be lead and backups that you do the backups first for the lead to sit on top of?

[01:12:27.810] - Speaker 1
Yeah, pretty often. Yeah. But I would sing on my own mic because they don't have volume in that range, but I have a resonance. It's a nice bass of the others. So I'd have my own mic. The other guy's singing their more natural ranges. I'm singing low. I'm not singing the lead in that range.

[01:12:51.600] - Speaker 2
Would there ever be songs where the lead would be sang at the same time as the harmonies in recording?

[01:12:56.100] - Speaker 1
Yeah, especially as technology grows, you do whatever. Or maybe you just do a verse on the lead and then do the harmonies and then you finish it up. I see. Later. It's all no-set way.

[01:13:14.180] - Speaker 2
Would you ever record music and vocals at the same time or rarely?

[01:13:20.340] - Speaker 1
The only time I recall doing that is our Christmas album where we did half the albums with an orchestra. You did it like Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin would sing with the orchestra.

[01:13:32.120] - Speaker 2
Live with the orchestra.

[01:13:32.850] - Speaker 1
We did that on a few songs.

[01:13:34.810] - Speaker 2
Was that a good experience singing with an orchestra? Yeah, it was cool.

[01:13:37.080] - Speaker 1
You was actually reading your notes. I was able to read music because I studied piano a little bit. So I was never a good piano player, but at least I'd studied music and I could read the notes. So I was 48.

[01:13:51.700] - Speaker 2
Over the years, were there different factions in the band?

[01:13:57.260] - Speaker 1
We used to take two jets from one place to another. One was a smoking jet, and one was a nonsmoking jet.

[01:14:04.990] - Speaker 2
So that's what made up the factions, the smokers and the nonsmokers.

[01:14:08.430] - Speaker 1
The smokers was a euphemism for those who were doing the dope. Oh, I see. Or smoke in pot or whatever. And it could be cigarettes, too, because not everybody metabolizes cigarettes smoke that well.

[01:14:21.700] - Speaker 2
How do you think you escaped the root of drugs and alcohol?

[01:14:28.480] - Speaker 1
Well, because of meditation, I think.

[01:14:31.790] - Speaker 2
The other guys meditated, too.

[01:14:34.590] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but they also didn't mind experimenting with all these other things. So I was fine with being relaxed and clear and energetic through meditation. It's not like I never smoked any weed, but people would say, oh, this is really great shit. And I was saying, not really. It's the same as it always was. For me, it wasn't that attractive. So I didn't want to I don't graduate to anything else. Understood. Because you would see people who are doing LSD and they're acting really weird. And if they were doing a lot of coke, they're acting really wired. I'm already energetic enough, I think, just naturally. I mean, I was very athletic in high school. I ran cross country. Three years of cross country. I was in the varsity cross country. I was captain on a team. I run five miles in the morning before breakfast. Wow. So I had some, what do you call competitive thing. And I didn't think being drunk or fucked up or stoned is you're going to put your best foot forward on stage. So transferring that competitive thing on the stage, you want to do the best you can, and you just can't if you're under the influence.

[01:15:52.720] - Speaker 2
Do you remember the first time you guys played outside of the US?

[01:15:56.820] - Speaker 1
Australia is what I remember. Yeah. Roy Orbison. Was on the show with us. Wow.

[01:16:03.470] - Speaker 2
Great hearing him sing live?

[01:16:05.410] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. He was an opening act for us. His last year, he was touring before he passed away.

[01:16:13.590] - Speaker 2
And what a singer.

[01:16:14.860] - Speaker 1
Oh, and a nice guy, too. Yeah. He really was a great singer.

[01:16:19.020] - Speaker 2
Tell me what you remember about the Smile Album situation.

[01:16:24.180] - Speaker 1
I remember that that was when the Drugs was at the worst. Yeah. My cousin Brian was doing LSD and whatever else he was doing because I wasn't there when they were doing it. Then this guy, Van Tijk Parks, was involved with the lyrics and stuff. So I wasn't involved creatively with it. But I sang on all the songs I was asked to sing on. But I thought there was just, I call it acid alliteration. I just thought there was too much monkey business, as Chuck Berry would have said, for me to be involved with. It was not a positive time from my frame of reference. The tracks were fucking awesome. It's the lyrics that I had a problem and the behavior around it.

[01:17:17.380] - Speaker 2
Do you think drugs changed Brian's chemistry?

[01:17:22.820] - Speaker 1
Oh, absolutely.

[01:17:24.260] - Speaker 2
Was he a different person before he took drugs?

[01:17:26.880] - Speaker 1
Yes. He was very sensitive always, all the way through it. And he was compulsive and really, for instance, if you're obsessive about music, it turned out great. But if you're obsessive about drugs, there's a chance that your psyche is not going to survive, not without some damage. And even Brian will say to this day, he says, Don't do drugs because he knows that he harmed himself. He just did too much or too many. And you never know. I mean, it could have happened once or it could have happened over periods of time. I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, for that matter. But he was so into it, into the music And it took him to fantastic places. But those drugs, I think you can look at it in terms of the timing of his being. I call him the Stalin of the Studio. Because he was absolutely the führer of the studio. He was in command, and he was great at it. And then after that smile situation, he shelved the whole album. He didn't want it to come out. Bits and pieces, droops and drabs came out over the years. And some of the tracks are really brilliant.

[01:18:54.840] - Speaker 1
But right now, he's in a conservatorship because of the damage that was done back then.

[01:19:00.720] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get to meet Eugene Landee? Oh, yeah. What was that like?

[01:19:05.020] - Speaker 1
He was into what they called 24-hour therapy. He wouldn't allow Brian to talk to his mom, his brothers, his bandmates. He controlled his life totally, and he took plenty of money for the purpose of doing so. Yeah, so it was very egregious. And he had to be the producer. We were doing CoComo, and we asked Brian if he wanted to be on the record. Well, Landee he wouldn't let him be on the record unless Landee was a producer. We had Terry Melcher produce that one. He did The Birds and Paul Revere and the Riders. It was very successful, and so we didn't need him. So Landee wouldn't let him dissipate unless we met his needs.

[01:19:48.400] - Speaker 2
How was it working with Terry?

[01:19:50.680] - Speaker 1
Great. It was really cool.

[01:19:52.520] - Speaker 2
Did you know him for a long time?

[01:19:54.220] - Speaker 1
Quite a while. Yeah. We were asked to do CoComol for the cocktail album, soundtrack, featured Tom Cruise and stuff. Like I said, I came up with the chorus. Terry came up with the bridge. I want to take it down to Cocomol, get there fast, then it'll take it slow. That's where you want to go. So he came out with that. When the director of the film heard the music, he said, This is the best song you've done since Good Vibrations. And I said, Really? I mean, we're just doing it because we were asked to do this song for the album. Sure enough, it went to number one, and it was very successful. Incredible. People sing along to it, too, because it's been on full house. It's been for years now. And so all these kids sing along to it. Kids from 10 to 30, 40.

[01:20:47.280] - Speaker 2
It's amazing. Is it true that Brian had a sandbox in his house? Yeah.

[01:20:52.350] - Speaker 1
It was okay until the cats found... That's a kiddy litter box.

[01:20:59.330] - Speaker 2
Do you sing when not on tour?

[01:21:03.050] - Speaker 1
I listen to my music with these ears because I have some hearing loss in certain ranges. The antidote to that is to listen to your music, so it keeps your sense of pitch. Right. So I'm doing that.

[01:21:17.500] - Speaker 2
How would you say your relationship with music has changed over the course of your life?

[01:21:26.360] - Speaker 1
Before we became a group, it was just a hobby. It was a family hobby, and we loved doing it. I think the love of harmonizing together was the impetus, the reason to get together, even though if you didn't 100 % have the same lifestyle or agree with everybody's politics or anything like that or religion, for that matter, you could harmonize together. I think it's a life lesson, actually. You can harmonize together. So much of that negativity disappears, division and stuff. So I think the fact that we love the harmony and harmonizing together as a family carried through into our professional times. Who smoked? Who didn't? Who did drugs? Who didn't? When we harmonize, no matter if it was good vibrations. I mean, Brian will talk about having I smoked some pot and got them thinking about California Girls, or he did something else and it helped them write something. I personally think that people are creative not because of, but in spite of. I can There's a billion, gillion neurons going on mentally. I think you have plenty of creativity to uncover. There's no limit to the possibilities. But music, to me, it's interesting because we still have the same feeling about recreating the sound on stage.

[01:23:06.670] - Speaker 1
But we've noticed over the last 50 years that these songs actually mean something to people.
