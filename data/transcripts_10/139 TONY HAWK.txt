[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 1 Tétragrammaton. 
[00:00:07.680] - Speaker 2 Tétragrammaton. 
[00:00:10.000] - Speaker 1 Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. 
[00:00:12.420] - Speaker 2 Tétragrammaton. 
[00:00:13.640] - Speaker 1 Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. 
[00:00:19.300] - Speaker 2 My older brother was a surfer. He's 13 years older than me. And then, skating was an extension of surfing in the '70s. He started doing it, and he's my older brother, so I was like, Oh, that's cool. For whatever reason, I didn't take the surfing the way he did. I liked it, but I wasn't that confident in the water with big waves. Once we found skateboarding together, I really enjoyed it, but it was really intimidating. It was like, all the kids, most of the kids were older. There was a skate park in San Diego. The Bulls seemed like they were gigantic. It was constant danger. But there was something about it when I first went to the skate park on my own and felt the energy in that space where it was like, it wasn't organized. It wasn't a coach telling us what to do. No one's relying on the rest of the team for their success. People were flying. The music, it was like a punk rock soundtrack. It was all new, and it was just I was like, I want to live here. I want to be in this world. And I got hooked. 
[00:01:33.940] - Speaker 1 Skate parks must have been a really new phenomenon at that time. 
[00:01:37.500] - Speaker 2 They were. I didn't realize I was at the tail end of it because to me, it seemed like, Oh, there are skate parks everywhere. There were actually two in San Diego, near us, Spring Valley Oasis. I was not old enough to get a membership at Spring Valley. I had to be 10. I think I was nine. My dad wouldn't lie. And then I went to Oasis and spent As much as I could get rides there, both my parents are working, so it was hard to get there as much as I wanted to go. 
[00:02:06.440] - Speaker 1 How far was it from where you lived? 
[00:02:07.740] - Speaker 2 Like 20 minutes. But it was just more like my mom worked at a community college. She was usually there till late at night. My dad was a traveling salesman of musical instruments. He was retired from the Navy. 
[00:02:21.420] - Speaker 1 What instruments? 
[00:02:23.680] - Speaker 2 Everything. Guitars, violins, drums. My older sister was in a band, so he was their roadie for the most part. Then he found a way to source instruments and just started selling them to music shops all around Southern California and Arizona. He was usually off doing that. Then I could rely on my brother at least once a week and my mom a couple of times a week to get to the park. I was there until they closed. I remember I remember I was obsessed. I had to be there. First time I got hurt, I got knocked on my front teeth, got a concussion, and I didn't care. 
[00:03:13.700] - Speaker 1 
How old were you when that happened? 
[00:03:16.620] - Speaker 2 Maybe 10 or 11. I remember being in the ambulance. I remember waking up and I was not where I got hurt. 
[00:03:24.960] - Speaker 1 So you got knocked out? 
[00:03:25.950] - Speaker 2 Oh, yeah. Then I woke up and I was in the pro shop of the Skate Park, and they put me in an ambulance because my parents weren't there yet. Then I remember this epiphany in the ambulance that was like, Oh, man, I got to learn how to do rock and rolls better. Because that's what took me out. That was a pretty pivotal moment in my life because it was like- In those days, how many hours would you be at Skate Park, typically? My parents moved around a couple of times, San Diego, and ended up in North County. It was just A pure coincidence that the last skate park, almost in the US, was right there. Delmer Skate Ranch. All of the other ones closed. 
[00:04:06.660] - Speaker 1 During the Dogtown days, there were not yet skate parks. 
[00:04:09.740] - Speaker 2 They were starting to crop. The Dogtown and the Z-boys were the ones I was reading about the magazines when I first started. 
[00:04:17.170] - Speaker 1 But they learned to do what eventually you did in the skate park-In backyard pools. In backyard pools. But then the idea was, Well, why don't we build something instead of using a pool? But it felt like that came after then. 
[00:04:28.720] - Speaker 2 It did. For sure. 
[00:04:30.450] - Speaker 1 How long was the window between them and you? 
[00:04:33.460] - Speaker 2 Maybe three years. Not so long. Not so long. No, two or three years. I went to Marina Del Rey. Actually, I went to Marina Del Rey. You like this story? Because they had You were on a skate park team, so I was team Del Mar Skate Ranch. Originally Oasis, then Del Mar Skate Ranch. Then we would go to these- Every park would have a team. They would have a team. I mean, that was short-lived. It was like one season or two seasons of But we would have to go practice at these other parks. I got my brother to drive me to Marina Del Rey, which is San Diego to LA. I'm trying to skate this bowl. It's the dog bowl. It's literally Where are those guys skate, J. Adam, Stacey Prelta, Tony Alva. I'm this little kid with this giant board, and I'm just trying to reach the top. They had a shallow in so I could do these little tricks in the shallow in. Then all of a sudden, this influx of punk rockers started coming into the park, not skating, just taking over the space. What is going on? My brother, we're not from LA, so we're just like, This is intimidating. 
[00:05:43.420] - Speaker 2 This is weird. Then all of a sudden, they all gathered in this one bowl right by where I was skating, but started spilling into the skate area. I was like, I guess we're done for today. This guy got up on a ladder and they take photos of it. That is the cover of circle jerks group sex. 
[00:05:58.600] - Speaker 1 Wow. 
[00:05:59.420] - Speaker 2 Then the circle jerks started playing. 
[00:06:01.060] - Speaker 1 Amazing. 
[00:06:01.980] - Speaker 2 Yeah. I'm 10. I had no idea that I'm witnessing this revolution at all. I'm just more like, Why can't we skate anymore? 
[00:06:11.280] - Speaker 1 So cool. Why do you think that connection between punk and skateboarding exists? 
[00:06:17.600] - Speaker 2 I think it's just there's a do it yourself aspect, but there's also just this outcast element of we don't fit in, we don't belong, but we're going to do what we want anyway. We're going to make our own scene. That attitude, that mindset is very much aligned, skateboarding and punk rock. If you look back, Henry Rollins skated, EMK skated. All these guys were deeply connected to skateboarding, and then that became the soundtrack to it. 
[00:06:55.340] - Speaker 1 Do you think that you're an unusually gifted athlete or are you a diligent workaholic? 
[00:07:04.420] - Speaker 2 I wouldn't say unusually gifted athlete. I was okay at sports, baseball and basketball. I was an average player. I wasn't making the all-star team, but I wasn't the last picked. When I started skating, I was heavily ridiculed for my style, for my lack of strength, for my size, for my look. I was bullied endlessly in the skate world, but I was possessed. 
[00:07:36.580] - Speaker 1 Would you say it was your dedication? 
[00:07:38.620] - Speaker 2 It was hard work, yeah. It was just repetition, perseverance, and a stubbornness, really. People say, Oh, man, you're so determined. I'm like, I'm just stubborn. 
[00:07:51.540] - Speaker 1 Yeah. Would you say there were other skaters for whom it was easier? Not saying they got better than you. 
[00:07:58.000] - Speaker 2 Absolutely, yeah. 
[00:07:58.960] - Speaker 1 So it was the work You were diligent. 
[00:08:00.820] - Speaker 2 It was the work, yeah. It was the 10,000 hours. Yeah. I didn't want to get hurt, but I wasn't afraid to get hurt. That can go a long way with what we do. 
[00:08:12.650] - Speaker 1 Absolutely. Because fear is probably the thing that would slow down all the progress. Sure. 
[00:08:19.300] - Speaker 2 Yeah. 
[00:08:20.500] - Speaker 1 
Did you ever get in surfing or never really? 
[00:08:22.710] - Speaker 2 Yeah. 
[00:08:23.580] - Speaker 1 Tell me about the relationship between surfing and skating. Similarities, differences. 
[00:08:27.440] - Speaker 2 I would say the link The evolutionary link from surfing to skating is the Dogtown Zee Boys because they were trying to emulate surfing by riding swimming pool walls. Then when I got into skateboarding, you either skated pools or you skated freestyle. Freestyle was flat land. The kick flips were not invented yet. Basically, are you cool or are you a nerd? Because the freestylers, they're not putting much risk out there. I mean, that was the They're doing pirouettes. They're dancing to routines. I wanted to be cool. I wanted to fly. I wanted to grind. That's what the pool skating was about. That's why I chose the type of skating that I did. But when you look at nowadays, most of these tricks that you see people wanting to learn, perform, they're freestyle moves. Kick flips, 360 flips. That was all invented by Rodney Mullen, who was the best as freestyler. But there was something special about him that we recognized, and even the most ardent naysayers of freestyler were like, Rodney is magical. He can do stuff that we don't even understand. Yeah. 
[00:09:45.000] - Speaker 1 Did you ever talk to him about it? 
[00:09:47.180] - Speaker 2 Oh, sure. Yeah. 
[00:09:48.240] - Speaker 1 For him, was it just a natural thing? 
[00:09:50.660] - Speaker 2 He was like me. He just couldn't stop. 
[00:09:53.840] - Speaker 1 Dedication. 
[00:09:54.580] - Speaker 2 Dedication, yeah. The thing that we identify with, I'd say, to identify in each other is this obsession with having to learn new stuff. Even he and I, we had probably the most successful competition rankings in skateboarding history. He won every single freestyle event except one in his career. I won most of the vert events that I entered. But the day after the competition is when we were released and able to try new stuff. That's what we cherish the most. 
[00:10:28.660] - Speaker 1 Would every Would a new move ultimately be an iteration of an old move? 
[00:10:35.720] - Speaker 2 Sometimes. Nowadays, yes, without question. Sometimes it was just like, what the hell? Rodney, the all-e impossible. It's where your board actually wraps all the way over your foot. It doesn't make any sense. You can't relate it to anything else. To us, it seems impossible. But once he figured it out, people started doing it. 
[00:10:58.240] - Speaker 1 Was it something he figured out fell into? 
[00:11:00.930] - Speaker 2 Or do you know? He would just tinker around with his board. He grew up near Clearwater, Florida, on a 
farm, and he had a slab of cement that he would skate by himself. That was his MO. Then he would just tinker around. Even like, he invented the kickflip. He just said he did an olle, he kicked it away, and the board flipped, and he goes, It's mocking me. If I just go stand above it when I do that, and a half hour later, he created the kickflip. It was just like that. I took a lot of inspiration from him because I learned how to flip my board in the air above a pool because I watched him. 
[00:11:39.320] - Speaker 1 The iteration was he was doing it on the ground, you were doing it in the air. But if you didn't see it on the ground, you couldn't do it in the air because you needed to know it was possible. 
[00:11:49.340] - Speaker 2 Yeah. Then the same goes for- That's the same for him. 
[00:11:52.120] - Speaker 1 He probably didn't think it would be possible to do it in the air. Right. 
[00:11:55.360] - Speaker 2 But then I would do tricks in the air, and he figured out how to olly off on the ground where no one really had learned it the way that he could. So he started learning some of my tricks like an airwalk. I created an airwalk where I take both feet off my board. I kick each opposite directions. He was like, Oh, I can olleye off the ground, grab my board and kick it quickly. Then he did it right there. 
[00:12:22.300] - Speaker 1 Without all the momentum that you had. Yeah. That's really interesting. 
[00:12:27.800] - Speaker 2 Then a lot of the early tricks were taken from surfing, laybacks, Bertleman, carving, all the stuff. But then at some point, skateboarding became its own thing in terms of, Oh, we're doing stuff in the air. We're flipping the board. We're spinning 540s. And then the power balance shifted where it was like, surfers were trying to emulate skateboarding after that. I see. Which is what happens now. When you look at surfing, it's big errors, 540s, stalefish, varials, kick flips. That all came from skateboarding. 
[00:13:06.460] - Speaker 1 How is technically the difference between being on wheels versus being on a board on water? Oh, it's a weight to it. 
[00:13:15.100] - Speaker 2 I mean, just the way that you maneuver the board, the way you generate speed. Some people can cross over pretty well. I'm not one of them. 
[00:13:24.240] - Speaker 1 Would you say wheels give you more control? 
[00:13:27.260] - Speaker 2 Sure. Because also You could take your foot and push for momentum. On a wave, you have to rely on where is the speed pocket of the wave. 
[00:13:38.560] - Speaker 1 Every wave is different. 
[00:13:39.690] - Speaker 2 Every wave is different. 
[00:13:40.620] - Speaker 1 But once you're riding a pool or in a park, it's the same every time. 
[00:13:45.270] - Speaker 2 
It is, yeah. 
[00:13:45.850] - Speaker 1 How different is it going from park to park? 
[00:13:49.100] - Speaker 2 Oh, way different. It shifted a little bit with the Olympics because they had to... Parks had to have... It's nuanced, but an overall vibe and different types of obstacles if they're going to be considered for an Olympic qualifier. That's my best explanation. 
[00:14:09.780] - Speaker 1 How many years has skateboarding been in the Olympics? 
[00:14:12.000] - Speaker 2 First one was Tokyo, so that was 2021. It should have been 2020. 
[00:14:17.680] - Speaker 1 So recently. 
[00:14:19.660] - Speaker 2 Yeah. And then Paris this last time. 
[00:14:22.910] - Speaker 1 So two times? 
[00:14:23.760] - Speaker 2 Two times, yeah. Wow. 
[00:14:25.320] - Speaker 1 Did you watch? 
[00:14:26.520] - Speaker 2 I watched, yeah. 
[00:14:27.480] - Speaker 1 And what were your thoughts? 
[00:14:28.820] - Speaker 2 It's amazing. It's crazy. I think that half-a-eight should be disciplined, but that's a whole other conversation. 
[00:14:36.740] - Speaker 1 Tell me about the skateboarding world that you entered at the time. It was the end of the skate parks. 
[00:14:41.750] - Speaker 2 End of the skate park era. The first era of Skate Cards? 
[00:14:45.320] - Speaker 1 Yeah. Because they came back. 
[00:14:47.140] - Speaker 2 They did. I don't know if you want to say first or second, but it was the end of the second boom of skateboarding. 
[00:14:52.940] - Speaker 1 Tell me each one. Tell me the history. 
[00:14:54.640] - Speaker 2 The first one was late '60s, early '70s, and they were toys. They had clay or steel wheels, and people were just using them to go down the hills in transportation. Then that fad went away. It was almost like the frisby of the day. Then in the '70s, it came back, especially with the Dogtown Zee Boys. 
[00:15:23.300] - Speaker 1 Urethane wheels. 
[00:15:24.780] - Speaker 2 Urethane wheels changed the game for sure. I think it was like '74, '75, maybe. I may not have that right. It was before my time. And trucks? The trucks were originally roller skate trucks, and then they started to make them specifically for skateboarding. And then the boards started getting wider. But I would say through the '70s, that was the revolution of equipment. And then the Dogtown Zee Boys era, people started realizing you could do a lot more than just go down a hill. And then skate parks started cropping up. So That was the second boom, probably bigger than the first one. 
[00:16:03.910] - Speaker 1 Was the goal of the skate park originally to get the feeling of riding in a swimming pool? 
[00:16:08.880] - Speaker 2 Yeah. I think the goal ultimately was profit. Skate parks saw people will pay to be here all day or for an hour or whatever. I mean, they would actually sell one-hour sessions. 
[00:16:23.640] - Speaker 1 But it was different than skateboarding down the street. 
[00:16:27.210] - Speaker 2 Absolutely, yeah. But it had a little A little bit of everything. Usually, Skate Park had a little bit of everything. So it had a reservoir. We call it a bank slalom. It was just a downhill bank that looked like a ditch. They had small pools. They had bigger pools. They had square pools. They had capsules, shaped pools. 
[00:16:46.110] - Speaker 1 What were you doing in a square pool? 
[00:16:47.160] - Speaker 2 Well, the corners are rounded just enough so you can whip through the corner. They had full pipes. They were just like ones they would find out in sewage lines, stuff like that, but big ones. Back then, when I was on Park team, they used to have what they called a pipe pasting event. You'd put a piece of tape around your fingers, and then you'd skate the full pipe and get as high as you can, and then get your hand up and then put the sticker up. If you made it, they would run a line across to see how far over a vert you got. Then that was the winner. 
[00:17:25.900] - Speaker 1 Then why did the skate park? Was it getting more popular when they went away or it got less popular? 
[00:17:33.080] - Speaker 2 It was starting to get less popular, but liability insurance became impossible. I see. I think that was the perfect storm. 
[00:17:40.220] - Speaker 1 Was there a case or something that happened? Someone got hurt somewhere and that changed it? 
[00:17:44.840] - Speaker 2 I think there was enough. I think it was just more that... I can't say there was a particular case, but I think it was just more that insurance company just kept gouging skate parks until the point where they couldn't- Couldn't survive. They didn't have the Clientele to justify it. I got lucky because the park I 
told you about Del Mar Skate Ranch, it was part of an entertainment center. It was like a mini golf, a driving range. They even had RC slot cars. 
[00:18:16.800] - Speaker 1 Cool. 
[00:18:17.900] - Speaker 2 All of that helped to keep the place open, even though the skate park was a big part of that and it wasn't doing as much business, they didn't really care because the rest of it was working. Then they lost their insurance, and that it. 
[00:18:31.220] - Speaker 1 Then what did you do when that happened? 
[00:18:33.510] - Speaker 2 That was around the time that people started building backyard ramps. I see. I had a couple of places to skate by then. 
[00:18:43.300] - Speaker 1 How old were you before you had your own ramp? 
[00:18:46.460] - Speaker 2 When I first got my ramp, I was 19. 
[00:18:49.120] - Speaker 1 Were you already professional at that? Yeah. 
[00:18:53.860] - Speaker 2 That was the other thing. All of a sudden, we were skating. It came back around in the mid to late '80s, and all of a sudden, I'm on the Bones Brigade. The Bones Brigade is just on tour. We were on tour endlessly. Globally? Globally, yeah. Europe, Australia, Japan. 
[00:19:10.820] - Speaker 1 Would it always be for competition or would it also be for demonstration? 
[00:19:14.480] - Speaker 2 Mostly demonstrations. 
[00:19:16.040] - Speaker 1 It'd be like a show. 
[00:19:16.990] - Speaker 2 Yeah. But I mean, in the sense that we go to a parking lot of a skate shop and they just put a bunch of junky ramps out and it's like, go skate this or skate parks. Because by then, there were wooden skate parks, indoor skate parks, and they were busy enough to justify getting insurance. So that was cool because we got to skate all kinds of different terrain. We didn't have that many options at home anyway. 
[00:19:45.560] - Speaker 1 And how many people would be on the tour? 
[00:19:47.860] - Speaker 2 Usually, they would send out 4-5 skaters in a van and with a supervisor. But the supervisor was also a pro skater, and usually they They were just along for the party anyway. So it was very lawless. It was very much like I always think of Beastie Boys. 
[00:20:10.140] - Speaker 1 
Like Cloak Rock show. 
[00:20:11.680] - Speaker 2 Yeah, but a bunch of kids traveling. No one's setting guidelines or rules except for be at the demo at this time. That was our rules. Yeah. 
[00:20:22.450] - Speaker 1 Probably the people in the shop also were probably kids. 
[00:20:26.100] - Speaker 2 Yeah. The whole thing was just chaos. It was just chaos. 
[00:20:28.380] - Speaker 1 A youth movement It was really counterculture movement. Absolutely, yeah. Counterculture movement. Yeah. 
[00:20:32.860] - Speaker 2 But I was always, at least, reliable. I never partied so hard that it affected my skating because that was always paramount to everything else. That was my priority. I had to skate good. I had to prove myself at every turn. And anything else was a distraction from that. 
[00:20:51.720] - Speaker 1 What would be the places that you'd stay when you'd go on tour? 
[00:20:54.880] - Speaker 2 Hauled In, Ramada, definitely sharing rooms. We didn't care. I mean, it was fun. 
[00:21:01.860] - Speaker 1 And the word would get out just through the skateboard stores, just through the shop? 
[00:21:06.480] - Speaker 2 Yeah. Well, I mean, Pau Parelta, who was the company behind Bones Brigade, their tour plan Vans were pretty elaborate. 
[00:21:17.280] - Speaker 1 How many years had they been doing tours before you? 
[00:21:20.460] - Speaker 2 We were one of the first, for sure. Really? Yeah. I think they did a few one-offs, but I think the first tour I went on, we actually had a van, like a van that you would travel with a band in, and then we put ramps in the back of the van. And then we show up to a skate shop, and then we just pull all the ramps out and put them in the parking lot. And it was like our little Lego set that we could put however we want. And then the crowds outgrew that scene very quickly. So then the next year, they bought a fully retractable mini ramp that lives on a trailer and hired seasoned drivers to be in charge of the ramp. So we would be in a van that's just the skaters, show up, and the ramp is already assembled and ready to go and the crowd is there. 
[00:22:15.600] - Speaker 1 Same as a van. First time you go, the equipment's in the back, you set it up yourself, you put it away, and then maybe if things go good, the next time there's another van with the roadies that have the equipment, and then you're in the other car in the vehicle to travel. 
[00:22:29.430] - Speaker 2 And At that time, and then years after that, we thought that was the biggest we're going to get. We were riding high. Yeah. 
[00:22:38.340] - Speaker 1 
How many of the, let's say, in the initial crew were four or five, how many of the four or five continued being the same four or five year after year? 
[00:22:47.300] - Speaker 2 I would say that lasted for at least five to six years. 
[00:22:52.900] - Speaker 1 You and the four or five other guys, that was- What they would do is they had what I would say were their A-listers of the Bones Brigade. 
[00:23:02.720] - Speaker 2 And those were Steve Cavalero, Mike McGill, Tommy Guerrero, Rodney Mullen, me, Lance Mountain. So usually they would put one or two of us in that crew, and then the rest were amateur skaters. They were all excellent skaters. 
[00:23:19.780] - Speaker 1 Yeah, just not as known yet. 
[00:23:21.710] - Speaker 2 Just not as known. Right. And so inevitably, you'd show up and be like, Where's Rodney? Where's Lance? It's like, They're not here, but we're And then those guys would tell me every time they show up, Where's Tony? 
[00:23:33.360] - Speaker 1 Yeah. How many teams were there in the country? 
[00:23:36.440] - Speaker 2 There weren't many. I mean, it was really like it was Pal Prelta, Vision, Santa Cruz, and those are the big three. 
[00:23:44.700] - Speaker 1 What happened next? I'll say, because I don't know if it actually gets bigger or smaller next. 
[00:23:49.600] - Speaker 2 As big as it was, it started to... Skate parks, again, were closing, even though they weren't permanent structures. And usually they were in the more difficult parts of town for the real estate cost. But skate parks, again, couldn't afford the insurance. They started closing. Skating was still considered a fad in a way. So it was like, All right, this cycle is over. Then, skating went underground for the most part. 
[00:24:20.670] - Speaker 1 Did the tours stop or did you still continue? 
[00:24:23.900] - Speaker 2 Tours didn't stop, but they changed shape. 
[00:24:28.120] - Speaker 1 Did they shrink an audience or not necessarily? 
[00:24:30.680] - Speaker 2 They shrink an audience. Absolutely. Because by 1992, I started my own company. I had left Powell because I saw the signs, and I thought, I guess I'm 24. I guess my career is over because I'm old and I skate ramps. 
[00:24:46.080] - Speaker 1 What was the first peak that you experienced? And then what was the first bottom that you experienced after that peak? Just to have an idea. 
[00:24:53.140] - Speaker 2 I'd say the first peak I experienced was '88, '89. 
[00:24:57.000] - Speaker 1 And your age then? 
[00:24:58.940] - Speaker 2 20. Then '92 is when all of a sudden everything was dropping. My income was shrinking by half every month because it was all royalty-based. Yeah. 
[00:25:11.420] - Speaker 1 Even like- And royalties on skateboards, T-shirts. 
[00:25:14.580] - Speaker 2 T-shirts But all the accessories, too. Trucks, shoes. 
[00:25:19.020] - Speaker 1 So the whole industry was shrinking. 
[00:25:20.610] - Speaker 2 Yeah. I was feeling it. I had a child on the way and two mortgages. I was like, what? The whole bottom just dropped out. What's happening? And so I started a company hoping that I could create what Stacey Prelta created with our team. It was like, I'm going to find the talent, and if skateboarding comes back around, we're going to be on top of it. That was the goal. 
[00:25:45.730] - Speaker 1 Was the feeling because you were out in the world of skateboarding at that time, were the people who were interested still interested, or were just less people were interested, or was the interest in all of waning? 
[00:26:01.740] - Speaker 2 There were no more casual skaters that were in it for the hype of it. They were in it because it was cool, even though I never think of it as being cool because all those kids in the '80s, when they were in high school, they were getting hassle if they were skating. But they coveted it. They loved it. It was more like it's just not as accessible. The people who truly love it are going to keep doing it at all costs. But there's very little support for that. 
[00:26:34.040] - Speaker 1 So there was a hard core contingent that was always there. 
[00:26:37.780] - Speaker 2 Hard core contingent. If you look back, especially if you look back in early '90s, mid '90s, That's the revolution of street skating. And that's when things were no longer, Oh, this is Southern California vibe. This is surf culture. No, we're in the streets. This is like New York City. Wu-tang is the soundtrack. Philly, Texas. It was all like everyone had their little pockets of scenes, but it was all street skating, and it was all mostly illegal. If you wanted to be a skater in those days, you had to endure cops, ridicule. 
[00:27:17.980] - Speaker 1 Kind of like the graffiti. It's not so different than that culture. And so many of the hip hop artists from the '90s were skateboarders. 
[00:27:29.080] - Speaker 2 Yeah. 
[00:27:30.000] - Speaker 1 Again, like a continuation of the punk rock side, just the inner city version. 
[00:27:35.740] - Speaker 2 Yeah. I remember what we thought was a big event in England, maybe '93, '94-ish, and De La Soul played at the event. So cool. I remember half the skaters were like, Are these guys really here? Because to us, they're a hugely popular hip hop band. We're still the dredge of the earth skaters here. Yeah, it was weird. 
[00:28:02.120] - Speaker 1 So when you started your own company. 
[00:28:03.880] - Speaker 2 I started my company in '92, got a team together. That's when I learned the hardships of being on the organizing end of doing tours. Because then it was like, All right, I got to book all these places. I'm the one to ask to collect the money and make sure that we have a place to stay, get food. We had this old really beat-up Toyota van that we used for deliveries for the skateboards for our company. That became the tour van. Mostly, I was driving. There were five of us, and we would go, skate shop, skate shop. There were a few skate parks left, so we'd go there, too. We'd show up, skate for an hour, sign an autograph, stuff for an hour, and then I would have to try to collect $300 from the shop. I would say I got it maybe half the time. Just not a nice position to be in, having to do that. No. 
[00:29:05.530] - Speaker 1 I mean- You're a skateboarder. 
[00:29:07.130] - Speaker 2 Yeah, but I signed up for it. I started the company. This is the new gig. Depending on how much we got, that would dictate if we're going to get one room or two rooms at Howard Johnson's, usually, and then, hopefully, Gas, and then, Talkabelle. 
[00:29:29.040] - Speaker 1 How long would Tours Just go for it. 
[00:29:31.780] - Speaker 2 Usually five to six weeks. 
[00:29:34.300] - Speaker 1 Even when there was less of an audience and less of a business model were tricks continually evolving. So the art form was always moving forward regardless. 
[00:29:45.240] - Speaker 2 Regardless. Still, to this day. The sad irony, in my case, not that I look back in regret, but I was still skating ramps, even though it was forgotten discipline. There are hardly any vert ramps. In those years were my most creative years in terms of learning new tricks and stuff. I had no audience for it. Like, literally, if you put a half pipe section in a skate video back then, we call half pipes vert. People would say, Hit the vert button. That means fast forward. 
[00:30:24.160] - Speaker 1 That's amazing. 
[00:30:27.720] - Speaker 2 Yeah. To this day, that's still That's the thing. In fact, there's a podcast called The Bird Button. 
[00:30:33.220] - Speaker 1 That's amazing. When did gear to protect your knees and elbows start? I imagine right when you started that didn't exist. 
[00:30:40.500] - Speaker 2 In my day, that was mandatory. You couldn't go to a park without having all the gear. 
[00:30:46.830] - Speaker 1 I see. Helmets, everything. 
[00:30:48.200] - Speaker 2 Yeah, but they rented it. 
[00:30:49.420] - Speaker 1 I see. 
[00:30:50.340] - Speaker 2 They rented this shitty, super-thin plastic. 
[00:30:54.050] - Speaker 1 We call it rainbugs. It was available because there was a time when no one even thought about it. Right. 
[00:30:58.520] - Speaker 2 I mean, my first concussion, I was wearing a helmet. It was just shitty. It was a joke. In fact, the edge of the helmet spliced my eyebrow, so I had stitches, too. You know what I mean? It just squished into my head. But I would say, Once the skate parks were closing, then all bets were off for pads. To this day, especially when you watch people skate, you probably hardly see anyone wearing pads, right? Out in the wild on the handrails and stuff like that, because once it wasn't mandatory, who cares? 
[00:31:32.520] - Speaker 1 Have you ever street skated at all? 
[00:31:34.520] - Speaker 2 A little bit, but my style was very rooted in what we call transition skating, which is like riding radiuses. So I'm not ready for any rough terrain or abrupt things like that. I went as far as I could with my street career until on one of those tours, I ended up rolling one ankle in the worst way on a handrail. Then the very next day, we're still on tour. I still got to skate, whatever. The next day, I went down a small set of stairs, like skating the other direction because my ankle was so fucked up. And then I wrecked my other ankle just as bad. And in that moment, I was like, if I want to continue to skate and have fun, I can't do this stuff. I'm not built for it. 
[00:32:23.910] - Speaker 1 No, it's completely understood. I think of the difference between skating and surfing. If you fall off the wave, there is the potential for drowning. That's a real thing. But you're landing in the water, which just seems like if you're going to be falling off of something, to land in the water is so much better than to land on concrete steps. 
[00:32:44.360] - Speaker 2 Yes, I agree. When people say, How can you ride these giant ramps? They'll give me shit. You won't go surf when it's a little heavy. I'm like, Because when I fall, the ramp doesn't come attack me. 
[00:32:58.380] - Speaker 1 It doesn't attack you. 
[00:32:59.660] - Speaker 2 Hold me underwater. 
[00:33:00.960] - Speaker 1 I try to drown you. 
[00:33:02.220] - Speaker 2 I know where I stand with this ramp, and I'm good. If I fall, I'm fine. 
[00:33:08.140] - Speaker 1 It's really interesting that difference because it does seem like falling on something hard seems like the worst option. 
[00:33:16.760] - Speaker 2 Yeah. I mean, one thing you learn by default and almost involuntarily through skating is how to fall. Yeah. 
[00:33:25.920] - Speaker 1 You learn that early on? 
[00:33:27.460] - Speaker 2 Way early on, yeah. 
[00:33:30.000] - Speaker 1 Are there secrets or tricks you can explain? 
[00:33:32.840] - Speaker 2 Well, if you're scanning big ramps, we do knee slides. That's how we get out of situations. The secret, the technique to a knee slide is as you're falling, you take one very quick step with your lead foot, whatever that might be, or your dominant foot, and then you go straight to your knee. You've taken the impact with your one leg just enough that you can take the rest of the impact with your knee. 
[00:33:58.330] - Speaker 1 You're not breaking the fall with your You're not breaking it. 
[00:34:00.780] - Speaker 2 If you do go straight to your knee, you'll jar your back. 
[00:34:04.730] - Speaker 1 I see. You use the bent foot as a run. 
[00:34:09.840] - Speaker 2 One quick step, drop to the knee. 
[00:34:12.130] - Speaker 1 To get to the knee. I guess you get good at that. 
[00:34:15.420] - Speaker 2 Yeah. You get good at spatial awareness, like a gymnast, where it's like you snap and you're like, Oh, something's wrong. I got to bail out. Even though I can't see where I am, I just know this is not right. 
[00:34:27.170] - Speaker 1 How much of what you're doing is always intentional versus, I'm surprised my feet decided to do that. 
[00:34:36.560] - Speaker 2 Well, in the context of trying to learn new tricks, I would say it's like, in my experience, in my approach, it's like two-thirds intentional, one-third happy accident. When I say happy accident, it's like I screw up an attempt, but I see something else. 
[00:34:54.070] - Speaker 1 You get a glimpse of how it could work, but you wouldn't have known that had You're not. Right. 
[00:35:01.480] - Speaker 2 Or I have something in mind. I want to get this done. I want to check it off the list. It just doesn't work. And then I find this side door approach to it almost by accident. It's like, why did I torture myself trying 
it this one way and not just go this way with it? But I was always happy to make those discoveries. 
[00:35:22.680] - Speaker 1 Skateboarding is fun for you now as it was when you were young. 
[00:35:25.360] - Speaker 2 It is, yeah. I broke my leg about three years ago. 
[00:35:29.740] - Speaker 1 Okay. Skating? 
[00:35:30.300] - Speaker 2 Skating, yeah. And doing a McTwist, like some trick I took for granted that I've done thousands of times and just didn't have the right amount of speed and was Cavalier and fucked around and found out. It doesn't work the way it used to. I can't just recover. Got my leg tangled and broke my femur. As I was still sliding across the flat bottom, it felt like my leg had left my body. You know what It was so obvious. It was like, Okay, that is disconnected. I broke my leg for sure. Getting back from that, I had a false start. I skated too soon. The bone never actually reconnected back to itself. It was offset for the first eight months of my recovery, and I was always in pain. At some point, I was like, This can't be right. I can't have this limp and be struggling this much. Then they took us X-ray and they said, Yeah, you have what we call non-union fracture. 
[00:36:31.060] - Speaker 1 So the bone came back together, but in the wrong place. 
[00:36:34.240] - Speaker 2 It didn't even come back together. It never did. At some point, it was on top of each other. I skated too soon. I shifted it out of place, and then it was just hanging above the other one. Yeah, it sucked. 
[00:36:46.770] - Speaker 1 Then you had surgery, I imagine. 
[00:36:48.220] - Speaker 2 Eight months later, I had it realigned with a very stern warning from the doctor that did it. It's like, You cannot get back out there. Don't get back out there the way you did. Take it slow. In fact, I want you to be on crutsches for the first two months, even though you won't need them. I'm only telling this because now, having gotten through that, getting to a level of skating that I'm at now that is back to a professional level, I don't take any of it for granted. It makes it way more fun. 
[00:37:19.090] - Speaker 1 Understood. 
[00:37:19.840] - Speaker 2 I just skated with my kids two hours ago at Kapa Skate Park, and just jumping over the hips there. That's a gift at my age, and then I get to do it with my kids. I'm not moving the needle on getting gnarly, but it's so fun. Also, the idea that skateboarding has come this far, it's accessible to everyone. 
[00:37:41.980] - Speaker 1 Is it more popular now than it's ever been? 
[00:37:44.440] - Speaker 2 That's hard to answer. I would say yes on an international scale. 
[00:37:49.260] - Speaker 1 But also- But now it's in the culture. It's not a fad. 
[00:37:53.580] - Speaker 2 
It's just something that people do. This dude showed up today. He was driving by, saw a skate, and he's like, Oh, man, I haven't skated in a while. If I get my board, can I skate with you guys? Yeah, go for it. We drove home, came back, and he was skating. It was just like, that's how it is now. That guy, skating is in his DNA, even though he doesn't even do it that much anymore. I feel like this is something people choose to do. 
[00:38:18.800] - Speaker 1 Like riding a bike. Yeah, they just think-We don't always ride a bike, but once you're not going to ride a bike, it's in your arsenal. 
[00:38:24.220] - Speaker 2 Yeah. Going back to how available skateboarding is. I mean, if you go a skate park right now, almost anywhere, you'll see people of all ages, all genders, all races, all backgrounds using the park and all skill levels, from absolute beginners to actual pros that are competing internationally, and they're all enjoying the space the same, and they're all encouraging each other. There's no other sport like that. 
[00:38:52.880] - Speaker 1 Tell me about the changes in equipment. Tell me what each of the changes allows that wasn't possible before. 
[00:39:01.370] - Speaker 2 I think in the '80s, it just allowed more stability because the shapes got bigger. 
[00:39:07.760] - Speaker 1 Wider? 
[00:39:08.880] - Speaker 2 Wider, yeah. Wider and a little bit longer. 
[00:39:12.180] - Speaker 1 I remember there was a period at some point where they got really long Yeah, that's more longboard, like cruise boards. 
[00:39:21.020] - Speaker 2 That's a different approach, but that exists. 
[00:39:25.040] - Speaker 1 Yeah, and at the time that they came out, it was new. We hadn't seen those before. 
[00:39:28.460] - Speaker 2 It was new, sure. It's just less trick oriented. 
[00:39:31.860] - Speaker 1 Then boards, I remember when I was a kid, they were hard. Then there was a time when they got soft in the middle where you could like... They would flex in the middle. 
[00:39:40.230] - Speaker 2 Those boards, those were more like the surf style boards in the '70s or slalom boards. Slalom boards were very springy. 
[00:39:48.400] - Speaker 1 What's the benefit or negative? 
[00:39:50.780] - Speaker 2 The negative is that it's not rigid enough to be able to do tricks. But the benefit is if it's bouncing in the middle, is you can do slalom and do real fast turns. 
[00:40:01.120] - Speaker 1 Back to that. Would it be that shock absorber also? 
[00:40:04.420] - Speaker 2 Not really. No, because you wouldn't be on those types of boards, you would not be leaving the ground. I would say around- Slalom is like you see the videos of the The guy's going really fast down the road. Really fast, just back and forth. Which I had to do as a part team member, and I was terrible at it. There's video of me hitting all the cones. It was just not my thing. In the early '80s, early '80s, mid '80s, seven-ply maple became the norm for construction for skateboards. Then it was just about what is the concave and what is the shape, and that is unique to each company. 
[00:40:44.100] - Speaker 1 Why is concave a good thing? 
[00:40:45.850] - Speaker 2 It just keeps your foot in place. 
[00:40:47.320] - Speaker 1 I see. 
[00:40:48.000] - Speaker 2 Especially when you're up on big walls and stuff. If the board's flat, there's a good chance your foot's going to slip off once you get- Does the shape of the nose or the tail make a difference? It makes a difference, mostly because we learned that As skating evolves, people start skating backwards. So now you need a nose that's just as long as the tail. I would say that was the biggest shift of equipment from the '80s to the '90s. Because then the '90s, all the boards looked like popsicles. 
[00:41:16.180] - Speaker 1 So now they're reversible, essentially. 
[00:41:17.820] - Speaker 2 They're reversible, yeah. And you're using the nose as much as the tail. 
[00:41:22.520] - Speaker 1 Still, does one side have more of a kick to it or not necessarily? 
[00:41:26.040] - Speaker 2 They're pretty much the same. 
[00:41:27.780] - Speaker 1 Pretty much the same, front and back. 
[00:41:29.400] - Speaker 2 Yeah. Yeah. If I were to show you my board, you would not know which is the front or the back. 
[00:41:34.980] - Speaker 1 Is there a front and a back? 
[00:41:36.630] - Speaker 2 There is, yeah. I just know because it's very subtle, but I've been riding the same shape for 20 years, so I know. 
[00:41:42.760] - Speaker 1 Do you think of skateboarding as competitive? 
[00:41:45.520] - Speaker 2 I think there is a sector of it that is competitive, sure. When I was growing up, the only way that you 
were going to get any recognition, sponsorship, support was through competition. There was no YouTube. The magazines didn't care what you were doing unless you were competing. 
[00:42:03.960] - Speaker 1 Tell me about a competition. I've never seen a skate competition. 
[00:42:07.020] - Speaker 2 Well, basically, my era was pool competition. There would be a main pool at every skate park. That's the competition pool. At Del Mar was the keyhole. Then you would go, there would be whatever, however many people in town, 100 skaters. You'd have prelimbs, and they would cut it down to maybe 16 people. Then you'd have semifinals, and then they would cut it to eight. Then eight people would generally get 3-4 runs, 45 seconds each. If you bail, you can get back up, start again. But if you fall, you're not going to win. You get marked way down, and you got to do something like just pull some brand new move out of your ass if you fall and to even be considered back in the lineup. It was supposed to be about your your style, your air time, trick selection. When it came down to it, in our day, it was just like, who was the coolest? Who was the coolest? Christian Asoy. Yeah. To combat that, I had to come up with the craziest shit, trick-wise, because they hated my style. I was bony cock. I was the nerdy kid that was just trying to maneuver my board and looked awkward doing it. 
[00:43:32.140] - Speaker 2 I had to do like McTwist, but do a variation of McTwist, like throw my board another 180, grab it a different way. That was the only way that I was going to get seen. 
[00:43:42.190] - Speaker 1 Do you say what Christian was doing was easier for him to do than what you were doing. 
[00:43:47.720] - Speaker 2 It wasn't that. It was just more that he looked so smooth. He was amazing. He could go twice as high as any of us and do some of the hardest tricks, too. It's not lost on Christian, he had the moves. Just, for instance, his lean air would count for probably one of my harder tricks. I could do lean airs, but they didn't look like him. 
[00:44:12.060] - Speaker 1 You had to do something over and above. 
[00:44:16.470] - Speaker 2 And I have to hide it from the judges because if they saw me do it in practice- Then they wouldn't be impressed. If I didn't do it, they're like, What about that trick we saw? Now we get marked down. I see. They were judging me against what they I was capable of. It was tricky. But I mean, whatever what doesn't kill us makes us stronger. All that just fueled my fire to keep getting better and better and better. 
[00:44:40.340] - Speaker 1 Would you ever get there a day earlier, something to practice something? Is there In the place where it was going to happen? 
[00:44:46.740] - Speaker 2 I would practice it not in the place where it was going to happen because everyone shows up a day or two early. I see. That's when you're under the microscope. 
[00:44:54.220] - Speaker 1 But how different is it from place to place? 
[00:44:56.190] - Speaker 2 Well, at some point, it evolved from pools to ramps. So the ramps were a little more reliable in terms of being similar to each other. They were all wooden, and they were generally-Better to fall on wood? 
[00:45:10.440] - Speaker 1 10 to 11. It seems like. 
[00:45:12.200] - Speaker 2 10 to 11. Yeah, I think so. I prefer falling on wood than concrete, for sure. 
[00:45:15.980] - Speaker 1 It seems like it. 
[00:45:16.960] - Speaker 2 It's funny to say that because they're having an event at this legendary Concrete Bowl. They're having in January, and it's going to be the last one there. They're having a legend's division. Everyone's like, You got to go. I was like, I do not want to fall concrete. It's not a matter of if I'm going to fall. It's a matter of when I'm going to fall. 
[00:45:34.620] - Speaker 1 Tell me about your shyness when you were young. How would you experience it? 
[00:45:41.700] - Speaker 2 I just didn't feel like I belonged. So I just would be very-Just quiet and reserved? Yeah, just introverted. Then when I started skating good, that was my voice. I used that as much as I could. Then people thought I was arrogant because I wasn't talking I'm just-Just shy. Doing all these crazy tricks. I was like, I don't know how to talk to people. I don't know. I think I broke out of it eventually because Stacey Peralta said, Look, there's all these kids here. They literally bought a skaper with your name on it, they're staring at you like, Go talk to them. I'm not even comfortable in my own skin. How am I going to talk to these guys? Eventually, I just learned to move through that discomfort and be available and be interactive. 
[00:46:32.060] - Speaker 1 Would you think of Stacey as a mentor for you? 
[00:46:34.590] - Speaker 2 Yeah, for sure. 
[00:46:37.100] - Speaker 1 Tell me about sponsorships. How do they work for skateboarders? 
[00:46:40.780] - Speaker 2 Usually, it's a contract, an annual contract. In the case of there's a strange disconnect with skateboard companies who make, manufacture skateboards because they are not the biggest in the industry, in terms of sales. Hard goods are the hardest to maintain a legitimate business with. You are officially a pro skateboarder if you have a skateboard with your name on it. But the irony is that that's not going to be what makes you money. It's if you have a shoe deal, energy drink deal, car sponsorship, or your competition earnings. But the skateboard company is the very least of your income. But you're identified through that. It's very strange. 
[00:47:30.260] - Speaker 1 You can't get the sponsorships without being-You can. 
[00:47:34.350] - Speaker 2 I mean, there are people that do it for sure. They're more focused on competition. But the ones that are vying for Skater of the Year, for Thrasher, they're out in the streets, they're getting the craziest footage. They definitely have a skateboard sponsor. 
[00:47:48.100] - Speaker 1 Tell me about the culture of skateboard shops. 
[00:47:51.540] - Speaker 2 Well, that was the hub. I mean, that was where you would go to find your crew, to talk shop, to watch videos. 
[00:48:00.140] - Speaker 1 Would they typically be places that only sold skateboards or would they sell other things? 
[00:48:04.380] - Speaker 2 It depends on the era. Generally, they would be only nowadays. I would say through the '80s, '90s, only sold skateboards for sure. But in the early days, yeah, it could be just sporting goods, and they had a little skate section in the back. Also, they're the ones that support the local scene. You can't dismiss them. Even if their online sales have affected their business and whatnot or they're struggling, they usually are the ones that people look to to put on local events to get teams to do demos. When I talk to people about those '80s and that era and doing demos, the first thing they say is, Oh, yeah, I saw you guys at this shop. The shop is what they remember. 
[00:48:42.580] - Speaker 1 Is there a crossover between skateboarding and X-games? 
[00:48:48.180] - Speaker 2 You mean in other sports? 
[00:48:49.480] - Speaker 1 Bicycle jumping. 
[00:48:51.930] - Speaker 2 No, I think that there's a synergy in that we use the same terrain. For instance, in the early '90s, I wasn't getting a lot of jobs as a vertical half-pipe skater, but I would get invited to be a special guest at the Roller Blade demos and the BMX shows at the State Fair, and that paid my rent. I was the special guest at Matt Hoffman's BMX show for the Michigan State Fair for two summers in a row. 
[00:49:21.680] - Speaker 1 Would it be like BMX scene in some ways, replace the skateboarding scene or not really? 
[00:49:26.930] - Speaker 2 No, not really. I think in those early '90s, inline skates did for sure. Inline skates? 
[00:49:31.810] - Speaker 1 Yeah, roller blades. But you can't do tricks. Not really. 
[00:49:35.780] - Speaker 2 But they did skate ramps, and they were selling tons of these roller blades, so people would come see and pay to see those shows. So I did shows. I was, again, special guest at Six Flags Parking Lots St. Louis for a whole summer in a Roller Blade live show. 
[00:49:55.280] - Speaker 1 Yeah. But you would skate? 
[00:49:58.200] - Speaker 2 I would just skate, yeah. Because there were some people that they knew my name from the '80s. Yeah. So it's like, Yeah, I remember that guy. I guess do all the tricks. You know what I mean? People that want to bash in my skating, Roller Blade, whatever. I was like, Dude, I'm so thankful that they were around back then? 
[00:50:16.420] - Speaker 1 When did your connection to video games start and how? 
[00:50:20.660] - Speaker 2 Around 1997, a guy approached me because he had a crude engine for a skate game that he had coded on his PC. He said, Hey, I think we could do a skate game. Do you want to go with me and pitch it to different publishers? He and I went to a bunch of different meetings. We went to some software studios. We went to actually Nintendo. I remember one quote was, Skateboarding is not even popular. Why would a skateboarding video game be popular? I said, Well, skateboarding games were popular. We had 720, we had Skate or Die. I think now that we're at a different stage of video game and home consoles, we could do something fun. Even if people don't skate, they would like it. It's like, no. Then about a year later, less than a year later, I got a call from Activision. They said, Hey, we heard that you might be working on a skateboard game. I tried, but it didn't work. And they said, Well, we are working on a skateboard game. We just did a game called Apocalypse featuring Bruce Willis, which is the first time there was a name and likeness in a game. 
[00:51:31.660] - Speaker 2 So it didn't do very well, but the engine is perfect for skateboarding. And so we want you to come see what we're doing. I went up to Activision the next week and they handed me a controller and I started playing this game that was Bruce Willis on the skateboard with a gun on his back, skating through a wasteland. Immediately, I was doing all these and kick flips and grabs, and I was like, Oh, this is it. I just knew instinctively that this was This is the game that skateboarders will want to buy a console to play. To me, that was the biggest success. If it's good enough for skateboarders that they like what they're seeing, then that's a win. 
[00:52:14.280] - Speaker 1 It sounds like in falling, it doesn't hurt as bad in the video. 
[00:52:16.960] - Speaker 2 It is hard to watch, though. There are some animations of my knee popping one way that I can't watch it happen. I have to choose a different character. 
[00:52:27.230] - Speaker 1 You talked about breaking your leg and As someone who's suffered so many injuries over the years, tell me in that moment when you realize what's happening, what's the thought process? Is it, Oh, no? Or is it, Okay, there goes two months? 
[00:52:43.120] - Speaker 2 It's that. Like, HowHow long is it going to take? 
[00:52:46.220] - Speaker 1 It's just how long is it going to take. The only reason how long it's going to take is because how long is it going to take before I can get back. 
[00:52:55.460] - Speaker 2 Yeah, that's it. 
[00:52:56.620] - Speaker 1 It's not, Well, it'll be painful for two months. That's not part of the thought. 
[00:53:00.260] - Speaker 2 No, I mean, that's a given. 
[00:53:01.450] - Speaker 1 It's just getting back. 
[00:53:03.580] - Speaker 2 Getting back, yeah. Or did I damage this so completely that it's over? 
[00:53:09.180] - Speaker 1 
That I can't get back. 
[00:53:10.040] - Speaker 2 Yeah. Is it? I don't know. When I woke up the next morning from the surgery, we're like, Oh, we got her back in place. It was like, Okay, here we go. Let's go. But that was my fault for thinking that way. 
[00:53:21.260] - Speaker 1 What's the longest you've ever gone without skating? 
[00:53:23.520] - Speaker 2 That was during that time. It was probably the second time around. I didn't skate for about three months. 
[00:53:33.000] - Speaker 1 Then when you get back, is it always like, I'm back, yes, or is this- The first go around of my broken leg, I thought it was going to be like that. 
[00:53:43.520] - Speaker 2 It was It was so painful and so weak. That's when reality hit me. I was like, I'm never going to get back to where I was. 
[00:53:50.680] - Speaker 1 I see. 
[00:53:52.100] - Speaker 2 But now- But now I would say I'm like 80, 90% of what I was before that. If that's where I live, it's fine. 
[00:54:01.100] - Speaker 1 Yeah. How popular did the video game get? 
[00:54:04.700] - Speaker 2 It was the biggest game. It was insane. When the fourth game came out, the first three were still in the top 10 of sales. 
[00:54:13.420] - Speaker 1 It's unbelievable. 
[00:54:14.410] - Speaker 2 It's unbelievable. 
[00:54:15.040] - Speaker 1 How long was it between iterations? 
[00:54:16.800] - Speaker 2 We came up each year up until 2010. 
[00:54:19.880] - Speaker 1 In the fourth year, one, two, and three were all in the top 10? That's unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. 
[00:54:27.260] - Speaker 2 Then the consoles kept getting better. Then we're out. 
[00:54:30.660] - Speaker 1 I also love the fact that Nintendo is like, God, no one's going to like this. 
[00:54:35.060] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. Well, it wasn't exactly Nintendo that said that. Someone said it. Yeah. But yeah, you're right. 
[00:54:42.150] - Speaker 1 No, it's just that much more interesting when the powers that be, the experts say it's a bad idea. 
[00:54:51.840] - Speaker 2 But also it took everyone by surprise. I mean, even the designers, we were just going rogue, picking music. I was just picking to my skating years. We got Dead Kennedy's and Primus. You know what I mean? They were all happy to lend a song because it was like, You guys want our music? Okay, sure. Then all of a sudden, the soundtrack took on a life of itself, and people credit that for getting them into punk rock or ska or even hip hop. It's crazy. There are four cover bands that only play songs from our video game on different continents. It's amazing. 
[00:55:30.620] - Speaker 1 It's amazing the power of music in that way. I think if it wasn't for the clash, I don't know that any of us would know any reggae or ska. 
[00:55:39.160] - Speaker 2 That's always when people say, What starts with the clash in Gang of Four? And then everything fans out from there. Yeah. 
[00:55:46.860] - Speaker 1 Gang of Four, incredible. Great. I see them live at two times, once at Irving Plaza and once at Roseland. Wow. Unbelievable. What a great band. 
[00:56:00.000] - Speaker 2 I remember speaking of something like that. I remember I saw Nervana right after Never mind came out in 1990 at a small venue in Houston because there was a skate event in Houston. Then everyone's like, Nervana is playing tonight. So all the skaters go to the show. I remember as they started thinking like, this is the coolest place you could possibly be in the world right now. It went crazy. I remember Jack Black told me that same thing about seeing Devo in 1980, where he's like, This is the greatest place anyone could think of to be right now in the presence of this band. 
[00:56:40.460] - Speaker 1 I saw Devo in Boston in this theater. I don't know what it was called, but like an It looked like an old movie theater type theater. It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:56:52.140] - Speaker 2 I know that place because-In Boston. 
[00:56:54.080] - Speaker 1 You had to walk through an alley to get to it, even though you get to it and it's a big theater. 
[00:56:58.880] - Speaker 2 When I was on in Boston, on the Bonesbury tour, the Dan were playing there. A great venue. I was so excited. I walked in, they're like, It's 21 and over, and I was like, '20. ' I was like, Come on. No, it's not an all-day show. 
[00:57:14.060] - Speaker 1 I never got to see the Damd. 
[00:57:15.280] - Speaker 2 Well, I didn't get to see him until 20 years later, but I still remember exactly that moment was in slow motion to me where I saw the poster. I knew I was staying there tonight, and I was like, One ticket. Like, No, bro. 
[00:57:30.880] - Speaker 1 
In the history, we got to the point where it was '92, you start your own company. What's the next uptick in skateboarding? 
[00:57:39.680] - Speaker 2 X-games. X-games started '95. It was a little scattered. It was a little wonky just with how they presented our sports because it was like, They're extreme. Camera angles like this and Mohawks. It was like, Dude, that's not what it's all about. But they found their groove, I'd say, in '97, '98. 
[00:57:59.400] - Speaker 1 What What percentage of the X-Cam's a skateboarding? Is it like a third or a fifth? 
[00:58:05.300] - Speaker 2 I would say it was more like a fifth then. It's about a quarter now. But all the other sports have shifted. Because back then it was like, bungey jumping and sky surfing and eco-challenge, just random stuff. 
[00:58:21.320] - Speaker 1 Do you think of yourself as a daredevil? 
[00:58:23.840] - Speaker 2 I think so, yeah. When I was a kid, I wanted to go off the high dive Yeah, for sure. Bounce on big trampolines and all that stuff. 
[00:58:35.440] - Speaker 1 Is it that you like that adrenaline feeling? 
[00:58:39.700] - Speaker 2 Yeah. But not so much that I'm throwing caution to the wind. I like the idea that I am capable of this. 
[00:58:49.630] - Speaker 1 Yes. 
[00:58:50.560] - Speaker 2 And yes, it can be risky. And yes, it's a little out of my comfort zone or skill level, but I know I can figure it out. 
[00:58:57.680] - Speaker 1 Has there been anything besides skateboarding that you've dedicated yourself to in that way? 
[00:59:04.400] - Speaker 2 Well, parenting, I suppose. Yeah. Which I had to learn the hard way through my years of success where it was like, Oh, you have to prioritize better and choose time with your kids more so than whatever you think this other thing is important. And that took a while. I mean, definitely took longer than it should have. 
[00:59:29.000] - Speaker 1 What's the current state of skateboarding? 
[00:59:32.620] - Speaker 2 Pretty solid. Very international. 
[00:59:35.700] - Speaker 1 Tricks still evolving. Tricks still evolving. How often do you see something where you feel like, I can't believe he did that? 
[00:59:41.020] - Speaker 2 Absolutely. I mean, it took me 10 years to make a 900, right? Ten years of my life getting beat up, trying it. 
[00:59:48.060] - Speaker 1 You were the first person to do it? Yeah. You were the only person to do it for a while? 
[00:59:51.670] - Speaker 2 For a couple of years, yeah. Then a few people learned it. Then Tom Shahr did a 1080. I don't know. Maybe Ten years later, nine years later, then Michibusco did a 1260 as the ramps got bigger, and they're like gymnasts. It's crazy. I just watched. This is last year at our event, Bird Alert. We have a big bird contest with my ramp. We bring it to Salt Lake City. I watched a 10-year-old do three 900s in a row. In a row. 
[01:00:23.320] - Speaker 1 Ten years old. 
[01:00:24.170] - Speaker 2 Ten years old. Yeah. In his run. That was part of his run. 
[01:00:27.580] - Speaker 1 It doesn't hurt as much when you fall on your 10. 
[01:00:29.660] - Speaker 2 But I I can't believe I get to live in that timeline. I was the one commentating. I get to witness this. I get to call it. I get to try to explain the difficulty of that, even though I didn't- So cool. So cool. 
[01:00:43.660] - Speaker 1 Do you think it's that humans are evolving? 
[01:00:47.680] - Speaker 2 Sure. I think it's just we see what's possible, and so that is a goal to start with. 
[01:00:54.820] - Speaker 1 It's like the six-minute mile. Once it's broken, then a lot of people can do it. 
[01:00:58.780] - Speaker 2 Absolutely, yeah. When I started skiing, no one did 540s. 
[01:01:02.720] - Speaker 1 So a 900 was impossible until it wasn't. And now that it's not impossible, other people can do it. 
[01:01:09.320] - Speaker 2 Now you skate ramps, it starts spinning. 
[01:01:13.400] - Speaker 1 Unbelievable. Yeah. It's really interesting. 
[01:01:16.240] - Speaker 2 Yeah, it continues. 
[01:01:18.760] - Speaker 1 That's an example, though, again, just an iteration, because it was a 720 before there was a 900, right? 
[01:01:23.780] - Speaker 2 Yeah. To put it in context, I did the first 720 in 1985 on a ramp way outside of Stockholm in this little town by a Lake with three people watching me. 
[01:01:36.840] - Speaker 1 Did you intend to do it or did it happen? 
[01:01:39.370] - Speaker 2 No, I intend to do it because the ramp was a little different design and allowed us to go higher. I was doing 540s a lot back then, and I thought, well, maybe this is the ramp to go one extra spin. I learned it in like half an hour. There were three people watching me. No one cared. I mean, it was cool. Yay. 
[01:01:59.570] - Speaker 1 Is That's not often the case where there'll be something in the environment that sparks you to do something that you couldn't do before? Yes. Because you were reacting. I was. You didn't decide in advance, I'm going to do this. 
[01:02:13.940] - Speaker 2 I didn't go with that intention. 
[01:02:15.470] - Speaker 1 No, but you saw the opportunity based on the real-world conditions. Yeah. Is it typically that way? 
[01:02:23.060] - Speaker 2 I would say it's half and half. 
[01:02:25.080] - Speaker 1 It seems like it would be easier if you got that glimpse than just, I have an idea, I'm going to make it happen. If you get a glimpse, Oh, the speed or the height that I'm going now makes it easier to do this thing that I couldn't do before. You see the opportunity is different than a theoretical idea in space that you're going to push to happen. 
[01:02:50.850] - Speaker 2 Sure. But it's interesting. Going from that, that was 1985. I didn't make a 900 until 14 years later. To do that extra 180 took that much time and effort. 
[01:03:02.380] - Speaker 1 Do you remember when the 900 happened, what was different about, what allowed that to happen? 
[01:03:07.280] - Speaker 2 There were a few things. One, that the ramp was built much better than most ramps at the time because no one had the budget to make great ramps. But ESPN I ended. In the past, whenever I tried to make it, I would fall forward. One time, I actually broke my rib. Around 1996, I had all the pieces of the puzzle. I'm doing it. Here it goes. Then I fell forward broke my rib, had to go pick up my son in kindergarten, couldn't breathe. No one was paying me to do that. It was all just for the passion of it. 
[01:03:40.780] - Speaker 1 How long was it before you tried it again? 
[01:03:43.660] - Speaker 2 About a year. But I could not get that commitment again because I didn't... For what? I don't want to go through that again. I actually had a ramp built that was bigger than most ramps. It was in a bull ring. It was in Tijuana. It was like, Oh, this is going to be sick. I was doing all these other tricks, and I was like, I'll do 900 on this ramp. Then when I finally got to it, I was like, I can't. I don't want to get hurt again and be stuck in Mexico. The key to it was at the '99 X' Games during the best trick event, I started trying it because I had done my best trick in the event prior to that, which was a 720 variation. I already had that, and it was like, What's next? Well, what's next is a 900. Impossible thing. So you were in the You've never done it. 
[01:04:31.060] - Speaker 1 The one time you tried, you broke your rib. 
[01:04:34.180] - Speaker 2 
The one time I've really committed to it, yeah. 
[01:04:35.900] - Speaker 1 And now you're going to do it in competition? 
[01:04:38.040] - Speaker 2 No, I just started trying it because it was like, Here's the next thing that I would like to do. Here's the next stage of spinning. It was for this crowd because we never had a crowd like that. It was just me like, Yeah, check it out. This is what you know. Then after about my third attempt, I had a super good spin. I had way more speed than I usually had. I was like, Well, if I'm I'm never going to really try again. It might as well be here because I don't mind getting hurt here. Then I started fully committing to it. When I did commit to the first one, I fell forward again, but it didn't get hurt. There was something that happened there where it was like, you have to shift your body weight mid-spin. That's the key. The next one I tried- You could have never known that until you diduntil I did it-until I did it-unsuccessfully. Until I did it unsuccessful and took the hit. But took the hit that wasn't so debilitating that allowed me to get up again. Because the first time I got hurt and broke my rib, I didn't drive away going, Man, I got to figure out how to shift my weight. 
[01:05:46.740] - Speaker 2 I drove whaling on the fucking trick. I'm never going to do that trick. I hate that trick. In that context, I just thought, Okay, shift your weight. Then the next one I did, mid-spin, There's a lot to think about because you can't see anything when you're spinning that fast. Shifting my weight to my backfoot, and when I came down, I fell backwards. It was a hard slam, but I was like, That's it. I fell forward, I've fallen backwards, split the difference, and I made the next one. 
[01:06:18.420] - Speaker 1 Is it that intellectual where you're programming yourself to do it? Yeah. 
[01:06:29.640] - Speaker 2 Just making these tiny adjustments every time and banking them. 
[01:06:34.100] - Speaker 1 So you must have great sense of your body in a space because you're flying and spinning while this is happening. 
[01:06:41.520] - Speaker 2 Yeah, after a while, you do. Yeah. 
[01:06:43.220] - Speaker 1 That's amazing. 
[01:06:44.120] - Speaker 2 What I'd learned in the years after where, watch what you wish for. Because then once I learned it, anytime I'd go do a demo anywhere, it's like, 900. Come on, let's see. It's going to take everything I have to do that. 
[01:06:58.040] - Speaker 1 Did you ever do it more? 
[01:07:00.330] - Speaker 2 I did, yeah. I ended up doing it like 30 times. Yeah. 
[01:07:04.280] - Speaker 1 Did it get easier or never? 
[01:07:09.620] - Speaker 2 It got easier to get to that stage of knowing I can do it. Yeah. For instance, at X Games, I think it was 
like 11 attempts. After that, it would usually take me less than five or six to get there. But it always took a lot. It was never a first try. 
[01:07:28.280] - Speaker 1 Yeah. 
[01:07:29.320] - Speaker 2 But what I What I learned in those years after is that as soon as you snap, if something's off, don't stop spinning. I've told kids that who want to learn it. Look, if you go and you miss your board or whatever, do not open up because you're going to open up and you're not going to know where you are, and you're going to be way further out of the ramps than you usually are, and you're going to get hurt. There's no question. 
[01:07:56.140] - Speaker 1 By continuing to spin, what happens? 
[01:07:59.080] - Speaker 2 You come back around the wall and you can get to your knees. 
[01:08:03.740] - Speaker 1 I see. 
[01:08:04.420] - Speaker 2 It's like you're so far off the wall, but your spin and your trajectory brings you back to the wall if you keep spinning. 
[01:08:13.040] - Speaker 1 Yeah. Do you ever spin where your back is to the wall instead of your knees? 
[01:08:19.480] - Speaker 2 The first time I ever tried it, yeah, because I didn't know how fast to spin. I did that in 1987. That's what prevented me from trying it after that because I literally landed on my back like, Oh, but if you open up- Is there anything you can think of that I may have done at some point in my life, something physical that everyone can do, but that takes some practice to be able to do it? 
[01:08:44.730] - Speaker 1 How similar is it to learning to ride a bicycle, what we're talking about? 
[01:08:49.640] - Speaker 2 It's like if you've ever tried to do a flip off a diving board. That can seem like the scariest thing in the world. Once you leave the diving board, if you panic, you're going to end up on your back. It's the same thing. If you go up to for 900 and something goes wrong, you panic, you open up, you're going to land on your back. One body motion is much more extreme than the other, but it's the same outcome. I see. 
[01:09:18.820] - Speaker 1 If you learn something like keep spinning, can that same idea apply to other tricks? Is that knowledge Are you based deeper than that trick, or is it just that trick? 
[01:09:32.500] - Speaker 2 That one's on its own in terms of what it takes to get there. 
[01:09:38.000] - Speaker 1 What are some of the ones that are more general, like a technique you use when it's going wrong that ends up having good effect on a lot of things? 
[01:09:52.400] - Speaker 2 
That's hard to answer. I would say the things that you do up on the lip where you're You're getting your board and you're grinding with your trucks or you're grinding with the middle of your board, it's very easy to get lazy on that stuff, and your board will hang up on the top and you think you're going to be in, and then next thing you know, you're on the flat bottom. We call that hanging up. There are very subtle feet maneuverings where you can avoid that, and you can use them for almost any lip trick. You learn them from the basic ones, but you You get them so dialed that you know if you get in some certain position and, oh, shit, your board's over the coping, you have that backup skillset. 
[01:10:39.240] - Speaker 1 Does the board ever hit you, fall on you? 
[01:10:41.560] - Speaker 2 Yeah. 
[01:10:42.020] - Speaker 1 But it's not a big deal. 
[01:10:43.960] - Speaker 2 I mean, it sucks. But yeah. I definitely have scraped up my knuckles, too. I mean, all this, my shin, that's my skateboard. 
[01:10:53.500] - Speaker 1 Is there some piece of equipment that you can imagine that would allow How gains in skating that have never happened. 
[01:11:04.340] - Speaker 2 That's how people got to do 1080s and 1260s. 
[01:11:08.280] - Speaker 1 What do they have? What's different? 
[01:11:10.040] - Speaker 2 Fone pits and bigger ramps. 
[01:11:12.420] - Speaker 1 So it's just you can fall much easier. 
[01:11:14.880] - Speaker 2 You can fling your body. You don't have to worry about opening up or spinning if you're flying in a foam pit. 
[01:11:19.860] - Speaker 1 I see. Past the foam pit, is there anything that can take it further? 
[01:11:24.940] - Speaker 2 I don't know. People try to develop harnesses and things like that. I'm still old school. I learned in the school of Hard Knocks. I learned on concrete all this stuff. I don't really have a gage where it's like, Yeah, go try that easy way in. 
[01:11:43.480] - Speaker 1 Who would you say was the most influential skater on you? 
[01:11:48.700] - Speaker 2 Eddie Elgara, because he was the most innovative skater at the time when I was coming up. He got ridiculed because they called him a robot because he was learning tricks. I was like, That's me. 
[01:12:02.440] - Speaker 1 
I want to do that. 
[01:12:03.100] - Speaker 2 I want to learn tricks. I learned his signature trick, frontside rock and roll, when I was 11. They moved me up two divisions as an amateur because I could do frontside rock and roll. I couldn't do anything else. But they were like, Oh, that kid can do front rocks, put him in 3A. I was like, Okay. I say it a lot. He was in the right place at the wrong time. He was the most innovative skater at a time when was in its lowest point. 
[01:12:33.160] - Speaker 1 Is there any training you can do outside of skating that makes you a better skater? 
[01:12:40.480] - Speaker 2 I would have said no a long time ago, but these days at my age, for sure. I work out three times a week doing strength and conditioning and stretching. It helps my skating just in terms of my endurance, mostly. With my leg, it's unlocked some positions that I can now get back into that I couldn't. 
[01:13:02.680] - Speaker 1 When you were younger, do you feel like- When I was younger, it was the antithesis. 
[01:13:07.360] - Speaker 2 Working out, that's for jocks. Jocks hate us. I'm not doing anything. You know what I mean? I'm not going to do anything that football or baseball players are doing. I got away with it for a long time because I could. I was lanky and I was skinny and I was flexible. And so I could just show up to any ramp, cold turkey, and do a bunch of crazy shit. 
[01:13:30.000] - Speaker 1 How much of skateboarding is feel? 
[01:13:34.400] - Speaker 2 I'd say it's half feel, it's half visual. 
[01:13:37.380] - Speaker 1 Have you ever skated with your either blindfolded or eyes closed? 
[01:13:42.080] - Speaker 2 No. 
[01:13:43.240] - Speaker 1 Would it be possible or no? 
[01:13:44.980] - Speaker 2 Yeah. I mean, there are blind skaters, but I rely on watching my board and seeing the coping. So much of what I do is watching the edge of the ramp and my relation to there. 
[01:13:58.140] - Speaker 1 So I need that visual. At all times? 
[01:14:00.000] - Speaker 2 Mostly, yeah. If I'm spinning or if I'm going to be blind to it, I know the feeling of where I am in the air to and what needs to be adjusted to make it work. 
[01:14:11.300] - Speaker 1 Does it feel good when you're going fast? 
[01:14:13.180] - Speaker 2 
Yeah, it's cool. 
[01:14:16.120] - Speaker 1 Did you ever get in the skateboard videos? 
[01:14:18.840] - Speaker 2 Sure, yeah. The first thing I did when I started Birdhouse was make a video. Oh, cool. We sold it for five bucks, and we asked people to mail five bucks to us in the mail, and then we sent them on VHS in 1992. 
[01:14:33.440] - Speaker 1 Were videos the way that people learned, saw new moves? 
[01:14:37.280] - Speaker 2 That time, yeah, for sure. 
[01:14:38.860] - Speaker 1 How big was the tape trading world? 
[01:14:41.860] - Speaker 2 It was big. I don't know how many we sold. I think we only made 500. 
[01:14:46.740] - Speaker 1 But they were influential. 
[01:14:48.220] - Speaker 2 To this day, people were like, Dude, Feesters, I remember that. Yeah, they got passed around. They would break. 
[01:14:55.140] - Speaker 1 Tell me about the Skate Park project. 
[01:14:57.080] - Speaker 2 That is my foundation for public skate parks. In underserved areas, we've been doing it for 24 years now. It's definitely my proudest work because I saw skateboarding on the rise, obviously in the early 2000s, mid 2000s, with the success of the X-games and our video game, and skating was just everywhere, and there were no facilities, and cities were not providing. I just thought, if there's something that I can do to give back to this world, it's provide skate parks, because my skate park was my salvation as a kid. It's where I spent all my time, where I met my closest friends, where I learned my skill, but also just felt a sense of belonging. That's what it was. We were the nerds and the outkasts. We were the misfits. The skate park was our safe place. 
[01:15:46.130] - Speaker 1 How do you get it to happen? 
[01:15:48.040] - Speaker 2 Through having a voice and a name that city councils would recognize and advocating for the kids in the areas that are trying to get it themselves. I'm not taking credit for it. I just became a conduit for it. It was like, these kids need a skate park. Listen to them. You're giving them tickets every day because they skate wherever at the mall, they skate. They're not going to quit skating. If you provide a skate park, people want to come to your city. 
[01:16:16.260] - Speaker 1 How do you know where to go to advocate for a skate park? 
[01:16:21.620] - Speaker 2 At some point, you learn the process, the city civil process can actually work. If you work the system, 
you can make it happen. 
[01:16:31.320] - Speaker 1 Is it pretty similar place to place? 
[01:16:33.340] - Speaker 2 Kind of, yeah. It requires city council meetings, petitions, hearings. But sometimes it's like, Hey, this guy has this land. He'll donate it. Well, that's one huge hurdle to get over. Or we only need this much more to reach our goal for funding. It's like some wealthy person in that area had a deep history with skiing, and they're like, I got it. Then we're the ones that can connect those dots. 
[01:17:02.740] - Speaker 1 Great. 
[01:17:03.420] - Speaker 2 To date, we've helped to fund over 900 parks. 
[01:17:07.000] - Speaker 1 Amazing. It's a huge number. Huge. Huge. And globally or mostly in the States? 
[01:17:12.800] - Speaker 2 In all 50 States. But we have a partnership with Skateistan, who they provide skate parks and educational facilities in South Africa, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Jordan. We help them with their projects because there was no one I would trust more. 
[01:17:31.580] - Speaker 1 How would you say, besides the fact that you've dedicated your life to it, it's provided for you and your family, how else has skateboarding changed you? 
[01:17:41.840] - Speaker 2 It's given me a sense of confidence that I don't think I would have found anywhere else. And an identity. Everything that I do almost inherently is connected to skateboarding, even with my kids in a lot of ways. And so I identify with it, but I identify with it proudly. And for instance, when I was a freshman in high school, I was a pro skater. I was the top amateur skater. I was about to go pro. I had to hide my skateboard before I went to school. I would hide it in the bushes, near the bungalows, because I would get harassed at school with it. I would get bullied, or he would steal it, or they would beat me up or put me in the trash can or whatever. That was going to happen. Then I would go through the day and try to be low-key and out of everyone's way, and then go get my skateboard at the end of the day and skate home, and then go to the skate park and be there until closing, learning all these tricks. It wasn't that I was embarrassed to be a skater. It was just hard to identify like that. 
[01:18:46.520] - Speaker 2 It was dangerous. It was dangerous, yeah. And nowadays, I'm old as fuck and I go on a plane and I put my skateboard up in the overhead bin in first class, take up space for other people. I'm like, This is me. This is who I am. Take it or leave it. I just mean it's an extension of my body now, and it's something that I am very proud of. 
[01:19:12.520] - Speaker 1 I'm so glad that you get to continue doing it at the level that gives you that feeling of joy. It's amazing. 
[01:19:22.200] - Speaker 2 I'm living the dream. I'm so lucky. 
[01:19:24.740] - Speaker 1 When you were 14, could you have imagined the grown-up you doing this? 
[01:19:29.400] - Speaker 2 
No. 
[01:19:30.380] - Speaker 1 It's unimaginable. 
[01:19:32.060] - Speaker 2 When I was 24, I made the washed-up skater list in Big Brother. I was washed up at 24. Still learning tricks, but for what? 
[01:19:44.920] - Speaker 1 Yeah, because nobody else cared. 
[01:19:46.330] - Speaker 2 I mean, I did. I still do. 
[01:19:49.040] - Speaker 1 No, but that's the beauty of it is your dedication is what allowed the whole thing to happen. 
[01:19:53.760] - Speaker 2 That's something that is hard for me to accept, but I'm hugely proud of it. If I did anything to raise a profile of skating or if someone got inspired by me and my dedication or stubbornness, it's the best thing that I could hope for. 
[01:20:12.300] - Speaker 1 What's the last trick that you were committed to doing that took a long time to get to? 
[01:20:18.980] - Speaker 2 I did that trick, the impossible. I did what we call a front foot impossible. You take off and you use the other foot to wrap the board around. It's like a two-part process. It makes it take time. Then I did it to a backside air. I had never done it, and I had to do it. I had to do it really high to have all that time to do it. I had to set up with my feet in an awkward position. When you do tricks, aerials to get speed, there's a standard aerial that you do that's just functional. It's just for getting speed. I couldn't do it like that because I had to have my foot in this fucked-up position, and it was in the way of my hand. I had a different type of air, and I kept trying it, trying it, got close a couple of times, and finally set a date. This is it. We're getting to some film. I had a Tiba Jefferson there shooting a sequence of it, and I made it. But it was so fucking hard. 
[01:21:19.750] - Speaker 1 Is that the only time you've ever done it? 
[01:21:20.900] - Speaker 2 The only time. The only time I'll ever do it. 
[01:21:22.510] - Speaker 1 Yeah. 
[01:21:23.760] - Speaker 2 I landed one and fell on-How many hours would you say it took to get to be able to do it? 
[01:21:30.780] - Speaker 1 Just focusing on that trick. 
[01:21:32.320] - Speaker 2 It was probably a year of off and on attempts, like an hour at a time. 
[01:21:38.100] - Speaker 1 So you knew it was possible. You just hadn't done it yet. Yeah. 
[01:21:43.240] - Speaker 2 And it was just as hard as I imagined. To do. Probably harder than I imagined because the one time that I did try to make it, I thought I had it, and then I just fell backwards across the flat. And it was like, fuck, if I can't make it like that. Yeah. And then the one- Was there a breakthrough or it was just- No, it was just inching towards it, inching towards it, and then finally landing one. Went up on the deck, just collapsed. That's it. Amazing. 
[01:22:11.600] - Speaker 1 Are there any tricks that have taken a really long time to learn, but once you learn them, you can do them like it's nothing? Yeah. How does that happen? 
[01:22:20.020] - Speaker 2 You just get more confident with it. Back in the day, we learned tricks to have them in our repertoire. In Bonesbergate days, if you learned a trick, you're going to keep doing that trick going forward. It's only in the last 20 years or so where it's like, That trick is so hard. 
[01:22:36.840] - Speaker 1 I'm only going to do it once. It's a one-time only. 
[01:22:38.420] - Speaker 2 It's a one-time thing, yeah. But for sure, there have been some other tricks that I've learned fairly recently, and It was like, I could throw that in there. That's a pretty cool one. 
[01:22:48.440] - Speaker 1 What gets you excited about learning a trick? Just the fact that you haven't seen it done before and you can do it? 
[01:22:55.280] - Speaker 2 Or even if it's something that has been done by someone else. 
[01:22:58.040] - Speaker 1 But you haven't done it. 
[01:22:59.180] - Speaker 2 But I've never done That's exciting to me. That buzz, when you land something that you've never done, that buzz, that's the dragon. 
[01:23:09.100] - Speaker 1 Does watching skateboarding excite you as much as it always did? 
[01:23:13.380] - Speaker 2 It probably excites me more now because of the possibilities now, because I'm seeing what's next. In a lot of ways, I was trying to help create what's next, especially through those '80s and '90s, but now it's way beyond what I'm doing. I just watch it like, I never imagined. 
[01:23:31.940] - Speaker 1 You're astounded by what you're seeing? 
[01:23:33.680] - Speaker 2 I'm astounded, yeah. It's fucking unreal. 
[01:23:35.400] - Speaker 1 What's the craziest thing you've ever seen? 
[01:23:39.460] - Speaker 2 There are tricks that Bob Burnquist has done, and he's more of a generation of '90s era, but there are 
tricks that he has done that I'm convinced no one else will ever do. For instance, we're in the weeds here, but he did a frontside 540, which is not Usually, you do backside McTwist. Mctwist is a 540. There's a trick called a NAR jar. What's that? A body jar is when you go up in the air, and then on the way down, you land on the tail, and it's very risky because if you're trying to land on the tail, it's a good chance you're going to miss, and your trucks are going to go over, and you hang up, and you're down. If body jars go wrong, you're getting KO. You know what I mean? There's no safe way out of a bad body jar. A gnar jar is a 540, and then on the way down, you come down on your tail. It's the gnarliest of jars, right? There's four people in the world that have ever done it. And to this day, I'm like, gnar jar. 
[01:24:41.600] - Speaker 1 But when you see it, it's just terrifying. It's terrifying. 
[01:24:44.720] - Speaker 2 Even to watch it. Because you know what can go wrong as a skater. Other people see it and they're like, Oh, that was cool. 5: 40 hit his tail. I was like, Oh. Bob did it frontside. 
[01:24:54.840] - Speaker 1 Are there things that you ever see in street skating that are astounding to you? 
[01:24:58.440] - Speaker 2 The way that people can just They're going to pinch into a rail and just stay on a rail now, and they're on a rail, and then they're setting up their other foot for what is going to happen when they come off. That shit, it's so far beyond me. I cannot believe it. It's wild. It's wild. It's what we put in our video games so that you could skate in a fantastical way because we never thought that stuff would be possible. Now, a lot of the skaters now grew up playing those games. 
[01:25:25.990] - Speaker 1 And they can do it. 
[01:25:26.820] - Speaker 2 They can do it. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. 
[01:25:28.030] - Speaker 1 Unbelievable. I think sci-fi works that way, too. You read things in sci-fi books that are impossible, but then 20 years later, the seeds are planted. 
[01:25:38.720] - Speaker 2 It's better. 20 years later, it's better than it was in that version of it. Yeah. Yeah.
