[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 2
Tétragrammitan.

[00:00:10.020] - Speaker 1
I was born in '62, the year the Beatles broke, where my father had three sisters, so three aunts, and then my mother had seven. So there was all these matriarchs raising me, and they were all obsessed with Beatles and Stones and pop. So I remember shopping with my mom when I was 18 months old. Beatles are in Liverpool We're in Liverpool shopping. I remember us holding our hand and people freaking out. It was 62.

[00:00:53.040] - Speaker 2
Unbelievable.

[00:00:54.120] - Speaker 1
So I'm 62 now. So it's definitely a fun.

[00:00:58.200] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm right behind you, right there. I'm very close. But I mean, we've been together for a long time.

[00:01:06.100] - Speaker 1
We've been together for a long time. Since we met, since I first sat down with you, you weren't in the dorm. You were out.

[00:01:13.680] - Speaker 2
I was still living in the dorm.

[00:01:15.290] - Speaker 1
You were still at the dorm?

[00:01:16.180] - Speaker 2
I walked from the dorm every day to Electric Lady.

[00:01:18.780] - Speaker 1
Right. Okay. So that is one thought that I was like, Was Rick in dorm?

[00:01:24.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I don't think I had ever produced an album before your album. How did you- I remember working on the Beastie Boys album, but that was not done. It was still in process. I want to ask you, I don't know how you knew about me because all there were at that time were the seven-inch singles. That's right.

[00:01:43.640] - Speaker 1
Cookie Puss. I heard it in a club. I heard it in a club. I heard it in a club.

[00:01:45.260] - Speaker 2
I heard it, Cookie Puss, though. But the beast is there.

[00:01:47.140] - Speaker 1
I heard that. They made it. But I was like, what are they doing? What's going on in that world? I had to know everything about it. And then your name came up. You were either working with them or associated with them in some way. And then it was like, as we were going through the process of Electric One, it was with him called Electric, it was called... I think I was trying to reenact the scene from Apocalypse Now in Richard Branson's mansion. They put us in after Love Album. They put us in Beggers Banquet, put us in this Richard Branson's studio in Oxfordshire, which goes back to the 13th, 14th century. There was an Irish wolfhound running around. There was Wolfhound running around, there was Field, and I was just lost because I was a city kid. And we had so much outboard gear, digital gear, and that seemed to be getting layered on every track. I would come in, I'd be eating mushrooms at the field. I'd come in in the evenings, reenacting the scene from Apocalypse Now. I'd be in full camo paint and come in and go like, What is this? It's so dense.

[00:02:54.560] - Speaker 1
I can't hear anything. I'd already clicked with Cookie Pussy in my head, and that stayed with me, the stripped back sound. And that's when I think we reached out to you.

[00:03:05.460] - Speaker 2
Was to like, Do you think you could fix this?

[00:03:09.580] - Speaker 1
And I believe your response was like, Give me two or three original tracks and we'll fix the rest of it. And from there, we came to New York and we met with you. And I remember you put on the Blue Cheer, Summertime Blues. And I'm not going to say what you said, but it's quite derogatory towards English music at that time. Like overproduced, dense, much more...

[00:03:32.680] - Speaker 2
It felt like the rock and roll had left.

[00:03:35.880] - Speaker 1
The animal wasn't in it.

[00:03:37.780] - Speaker 2
That energy had turned into something else.

[00:03:40.230] - Speaker 1
It had. I think growing up in North America was a real thing for me as well because I grew up in Canada. To me, New York City was Mecca. It was a place that was mythical. Every Saturday morning, I would watch religiously Soul Train, and I would try and copy the dance moves, and what is this music? I was so caught up in it. I know all the sports and everything, but just- Soul Train was the greatest show. What year was it? '75, Pink Floyd came to Hamilton, Ontario. I was 13.

[00:04:14.380] - Speaker 2
How did you get from Liverpool to Ontario?

[00:04:18.700] - Speaker 1
Well, my mother was Scot. She was from Glasgow. And at the age of six weeks old, I was pretty much taken to Scotland. So we lived between Liverpool area Was Birkenhead. It was across the River, the River Mersey. Where the fairy crossed the Mersey. That's where it goes to, Birkenhead, which isn't considered to be Liverpool. And people in that local area will let you know. It's like New Jersey, New York. It's like, no.

[00:04:45.080] - Speaker 2
It's just right over the river.

[00:04:45.980] - Speaker 1
It's just literally over the river.

[00:04:47.540] - Speaker 2
It's right there.

[00:04:48.720] - Speaker 1
So dad's from that area, mother's from Glasgow. So I lived between the two cities. And in the early '70s, Britain was in an economic slump. And what was Glasgow like at that time? Very rough. Both cities have been bombed very heavily during World War II. So I was born 17 years after the end of World War II. We were still playing in bombed-out buildings as kids. Everybody still had a post-war mentality rationing and fruit came in a can. So Malcolm Claren talked about this. We were born in a culture of necessity as opposed to the culture of abundance, availability. And that's why that music, I honestly believe, came out at that time because it came out of a very desperate, necessary life force was coming through this world that had been bombed. And that's the thing, it's why the Beatles were so important.

[00:05:41.960] - Speaker 2
So your first memory of music sounds like your parents and the Beatles.

[00:05:47.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah. My dad was in the Merchant Navy. He traveled a lot and he brought records back. In fact, he was in Brooklyn in the '50s. He would bring back records like Paul Robeson and play them in the house.

[00:05:57.820] - Speaker 2
So growing up, you heard eclectic music?

[00:06:00.500] - Speaker 1
Yeah. My mother loved Johnny Mathes.

[00:06:02.420] - Speaker 2
Oh, fantastic. You got to hear all different things.

[00:06:05.100] - Speaker 1
I got to hear everything. That's great. I remember seeing Magical mystery Tour on TV when it came out. But it was in black and white.

[00:06:11.800] - Speaker 2
Wow.

[00:06:12.680] - Speaker 1
I remember trading yellow, trading cards on the playground. They were like, didn't have Pokémon cards. We had yellow submarine cards. Pirate radio.

[00:06:23.840] - Speaker 2
Even then there was pirate radio.

[00:06:25.640] - Speaker 1
In the late '60s, I had a small Japanese transistor radio, about eight or 9. And I had a single. It was one single. It was mono, single ear plug. So when I went to bed, when I was supposed to be sleeping, I was listening to Radio Luxembourg, could pick up a bit of radio Caroline. So I was hearing this other music from other dimensions. I vaguely remember hearing Riders on the Storm in '70, '71. Came through this little headphones like something exotic at the age of 10. And then Bowie, of course.

[00:06:58.040] - Speaker 2
How do you think the fact that you were able to to hear these things and no one else was able to hear them at that time, how did that impact you? Do you think it would be different if it was playing on the radio and everyone heard it, or was it special because it was like a secret that you were let in on?

[00:07:16.060] - Speaker 1
Well, because we moved around a lot, I was always a new kid at school. I went to about nine schools between going from Glasgow to Liverpool area, Merseyside. I was always an outsider. I was always a new kid at school. But the constant was music. Yeah. So I'd find the kids that were the other kids on the fringes of the regular, the more conservative kids that were program. We were not program. We were on the outside. I had long hair in the '60s as well. So music's what we identified with was like, What are you like? I'd be like, Slade, Sweet, T-rex, Bowie. I'd be like, Okay, I'm with you. Slade were like, they started as skinheads. Sweet were a bit more glam. They wore a lot more makeup than Slate. So Sweet were more glammy. Mark Bowen was Fem. If you like Bowen, you were definitely on the outside because he wasn't a geyser. I love Bowen. The first two singles I bought-The music was incredible. It's staggering. In fact, I think the doc just came out on him, Mark Bowen. But the first two things I bought was Life on Mars with my own money and 25 pence.

[00:08:34.050] - Speaker 1
I think it was Telegram Sam, like seven inches, went to Walworths and got them at 10. And that was it. That was zero point. I now had the actual holy relic. In my hand, it was vibrating. It was a tantric weapon. The seven-inch single went on and I just played it over and over again. What was your first memory of punk rock? Oh, first memory of punk rock? Well, I live I was in Canada at the time, and we emigrate to Canada in 1973 because the economy in Britain was really bad and there was no work. And we had an aunt who lived in Hamilton, Ontario. So she was able to sponsor my family to go to Canada. So my dad was like, We're going to emigrate. We got a choice of New Zealand, South Africa or Canada. Let's pick it out the hat. I think they've written Canada on every single bit of paper. But it was a fun game for the kids. I have a brother who's 11 months younger and a sister who's five years younger. So we all picked the name out and he said, What do you got? Canada. Okay, we're going to Canada.

[00:09:35.700] - Speaker 1
So I think the first thing was like being on the... Coming from the airport in Toronto to Hamilton on a freeway in a big car, a massive car, looking out the window in absolute disbelief at the architecture, the freeways, the size of the car. Different. Different. Yeah. Completely different planet. There was television shows coming from America that we saw, but being in 5D, really in it.

[00:10:07.900] - Speaker 2
And still, BBC was so ubiquitous that I don't know how much US stuff you'd see. We got I've seen films, maybe.

[00:10:16.270] - Speaker 1
I remember stuff like, well, the films my father would take me to see were things like Lawrence of Arabia, David Lane, Peter O'Tull, who Bowie adored. That's where we got the Let's Dance look was from Peter at all. That was the character. Yeah. So that was the films with these epic romantic films that were taking to see. Or I saw the Jungle Book. I've seen that, the Technicolor, which was pretty intense. The color was intense because the places we lived were post-war, very gray, quite monochromatic. And then you go and see a Technicolor movie and you'll be like, whoa. I think the Beatles were tapping into that with, obviously, they went from gothic tenements and grayness and bombed out Britain and Northern Germany to having cups of tea and all of a sudden get psychedelic. So there was this new world of color. Yeah.

[00:11:15.580] - Speaker 2
If you think of their album covers, it did go from a black and white world to a technicolor world just over the covers.

[00:11:22.180] - Speaker 1
Revolver to Rubber Soul, Rubber Soul Revolver. Then I think it was Sergeant Peppers.

[00:11:28.130] - Speaker 2
I think that's right.

[00:11:28.980] - Speaker 1
Then that's like a full It's a scene change. That's nuts. But there's so much going on. But that was my first impressions of North America. So it's Star Trek. I'm a Star Trek. But then coming to North America and we got to our apartment, Which was on the 11th floor of an apartment building. My mind was blown. My dad said, We got this TV set. It's a huge piece of furniture. It was an admiral, was a minimum of that? 48 channels. 48 channels in color.

[00:11:59.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:12:00.800] - Speaker 1
We could not believe this piece of machinery. It was alien to us. We had three channels in black and white. But the good thing was when we lived in the Merseyside area, you'd had Top of the pops every Thursday night. And it would, for some reason, play later on BBC Wales because we're in the Northwest. So we'd see it on BBC Northwest, whatever that was, and then flip over and be able to see it again. That's the only way you can see Starman in 1972 when it was on in black and white. It's like you flip over to the BBC Wales. So maybe got to see half of it again or something like that. But I remember that being on TV. But the thing in Britain was that everybody saw pretty much every kid at that moment who was drawn into music in this new culture, post-world culture, the lightning, the voltage was coming through the same channel, and that's what they were picking up on. So it was a collective experience.

[00:12:57.580] - Speaker 2
So other than the pirate radio that you got to hear because that was outside of that.

[00:13:03.060] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was outside of that. There's a lot of pop magazines, mostly ended like teenage girls, Jackie. It's a magazine called Popswap. Color pictures of your favorite pop stars, both appear in these magazines. Tear these pictures out, they'd be on the walls of my aunt. You'd see these color pictures, again, color in this black and white world, monochromatic world. You see these color images of whomever they were into. And as the time was progressing, the clothing was changing, the look was changing. That was our Instagram. It was actually tactile, tearing pictures out of magazines because when I was in Canada, I was so homesick for the culture. I missed it. It was very different Canada. And then I was at another. I was definitely an absent outside. I was an immigrant and treated as such. So I wasn't with the regular native. Kids have been there for several generations. So my group was like Indigenous One of my best friends was Jamaica. There was a German girl, didn't speak much English. That was my set. And like, Kiss was very popular, but I saw the New York dolls on Christmas Rock concert, whatever, in '74, and I was like, Oh, this.

[00:14:19.160] - Speaker 1
So you talk about punk rock? Yeah. That was probably the first time I saw anything.

[00:14:23.940] - Speaker 2
I just watched that clip the other day, that exact clip of them on that.

[00:14:27.200] - Speaker 1
It was like personality crisis or something.

[00:14:30.000] - Speaker 2
That's what it was.

[00:14:31.400] - Speaker 1
You forget how unbelievable. David Johansson and Johnny Thunder. Oh, my God. You're a teenage kid.

[00:14:41.000] - Speaker 2
It was a good group.

[00:14:42.120] - Speaker 1
It was a phenomenal or grew up. Billy and I bonded on that later. We went to see Johnny Thunder in the early '80s in London Lyceum. We actually ended up playing with him at a cat club in New York.

[00:14:53.000] - Speaker 2
Fantastic.

[00:14:54.100] - Speaker 1
Very drunk. He wasn't in good shape. He was being held up on stage.

[00:14:59.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I saw him fall off several stages over the years.

[00:15:02.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was a lot. I mean, it was a petri dish. It was just my path. I didn't separate that I had some unique path. That was my life. That was my family, my life. It just was. I just accepted it just was and had to deal with the trials and tribulations of each change. I don't think my parents really understood the effect it had on us, the way it impacted us, all these different changes. But like I said, the music stayed constant and it was always there. If I needed some escape, there's any transgressions or abandonment or whatever it was or being resented at a new school for being an immigrant kid or whatever, the music would come on. I'd go home and put the music on, and that would be like, I'm now in my place. Tense request about punk rock. I mean, New York dolls, yes. But we went back on a vacation in '77, and it was a Queen's Jubilee. And my grandfather wanted us to go see the Queen on the Royal yacht. There was going down the Mersey and we're on the Birkenhead side. So we went to some point where you could see there's the Royal yacht going by and everyone's waving, Hello, the Queen.

[00:16:13.840] - Speaker 1
It's a Jubilee. And then there's all these kids with spiky hair and ripped clothes. And I was looking at them going, What is going on? Who are these disheveled kids?

[00:16:25.300] - Speaker 2
Because we hadn't even seen images of punks yet.

[00:16:27.840] - Speaker 1
No. I think there was maybe a vague whisper about the pistols listening to... Because we had FM radio in Canada. We had stereo, and they would play full albums, and they would start to talk about this thing happening in the UK. So this is '77, summer of '77. And I remember going to Walworths because that's where I got my singles. Number one was blanked out. It was just like they had all the other top 20, but number one was blanked out. It was God Save the Queen. And these kids were flipping off the Queen. And I was like, They're outsiders. Wow, my tribe. So as soon as I went back to Canada after three, four week holiday for Christmas, my mom got me Never mind the bollocks. So December 25th, 1977, I'm opening that. I'm gone like, Oh. And I put it on. She says, Play the record. Let's hear it. I'll play it for a friend. I put it on. After about 20 seconds, she was like, Can you turn that off? It's so good. I am an He cries. She's like, Turn that off. But you can play in your bedroom. We had a set of encyclopedias in our house.

[00:17:36.500] - Speaker 1
We were allowed to explore. They kept an eye on us, but they never came down and said, Turn that music off. They'd encourage us, especially my mom. She was like, Let me buy records. Let me have long hair.

[00:17:50.280] - Speaker 2
So the pistols weren't for her, but it was okay for you.

[00:17:53.000] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was fine for me. She understood it. Great. Yeah. Well, she understood my affection for it. And then I became full punk. Like, cut my hair. I think I had a baker's jacket that I took. My sister took in for me. She could sew a bit. Flared trousers, became straight like trousers. I went from in progressive I've rocked and Bowie, a little bit of Iggy into full punk. And that was '78. But I left school. In '78, I left school because my mom got cancer. So I actually She left school so I could work to bring the extra money home so we could get money to go back to Britain because she wanted to die with her family. September '78, we went back to Britain. And then I was back in this schoolyard in Glasgow, which is a pretty rough place, and I was a yank. I wasn't a Brit kid.

[00:18:50.580] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but you weren't. But to them, you were.

[00:18:53.320] - Speaker 1
I'm actually more Scot than I am English. I see. According to my DNA. Just found out I'm 3% Danish as well. So that's The Viking. That was it. And then I was on the playground. But there was all the punk kids there, and they were like, Come and hang out with us. Don't worry about them. They're bullies. They don't get it. Hang out with the punk kids. And then met two or three kids who were like, we're going to see the Stranglers, Stranglers 78, Glasgow, Apollo. The week before, we went to see Nazareth because it didn't matter.

[00:19:24.170] - Speaker 2
It was crossover.

[00:19:25.040] - Speaker 1
It was a crossover thing. If you like Bon Scott, if you like AC/DC and punk, that was fine. There wasn't that cultural Apartheid that MTV brought in in the '80s, where it's 120 minutes, Headbanger's Ball, MTV raps. They weren't segregating us. We could like anything we wanted. You could like Bob Marley. It was totally cool. It was all part of the same synergy. It was just music and culture.

[00:19:51.640] - Speaker 2
Then I was in. So Stranglers was the first punk rock gig?

[00:19:54.140] - Speaker 1
First show I went to was the first show I actually saw. The first thing I ever saw was Pink Floyd, 1975. I arrived, Hamilton, Ontario, June 28th, I think it was. My brother and I went down to the stadium. It was supposed to sell 25,000 tickets. They sold 50. The place was rammed. The way the stadium was built was like a CFL stadium. There's a whole section you could see through into the stage. So we went down to collect cans and bottles. We thought it would be a good opportunity to make some money. So we got bin bags, garbage bags, collecting cans and bottles. I remember looking through and seeing the airplane crash into the stage and Shining a new crazy diamond, and they hadn't even released Wish You Were Here yet. I was 13 years old and that was a lightning bolt. It's like, what is this energy? I remember going home on the bus, I couldn't even speak about it. I don't know what to say about it. Just had this deep knowing that I wanted to be in there with those kids, having that experience, that communion. And then that was it.

[00:20:57.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Pink Floyd is a good first First whiff.

[00:21:01.700] - Speaker 1
That was the first whiff.

[00:21:03.360] - Speaker 2
That's a good one.

[00:21:04.170] - Speaker 1
That was a whiff. That was a good one. That was the first time I heard electric amplified music. Yeah. It was mind-numming. I can play in my head. I can play the tape. I can play the visual and the audio on my head and it access the feeling of what it went through all the chakras because it activated everything. Being a teenage boy, just coming of age, so everything was activated. Then it was about the rest of the life getting in alignment because there's a lot of trauma in there as well. Trauma from family, post-war. Father weren't through the streets when they were being bombed by the German. Second most heavily bombed city in Britain, besides London, was actually Merseyside. And a lot hit when my father lived in Birkenhead because all the shipyards were there. So he was telling me stories about running through the streets, the bombs falling. I didn't know about PTSD Until later when I had to face that in my own life. But he was gone by then. He passed when he was 58. And that was when the cult was MTV, 27 years old. I didn't want anything to do with it.

[00:22:14.920] - Speaker 1
I was like, no, I'm out. I'm out. They were like, okay, there's the road. It's not paved. It's going to get dark. I was like, I want that. That was the journey. Yeah. Post-electric. Eric, which was where my heart was in that room with us kids. We're like Dikenzian kids scavenging for pizza, grilled cheese. And any bit of cultural information that we could get, we would share it. I remember you introduced me to Hello Cool Jay in the street outside a Revolution Cafe. He was 19 years old with a kangle hat on and everything. I was like, he looked amazing. And what a frequency. It's such a vibration around the sky. I was like, What's his music about? And going deep into that or going deep into the beasties or I loved Africa Bambata. Mclaren brought that to us.

[00:23:13.300] - Speaker 2
I remember we would watch videos in the studio of all kinds of just cool old rock stuff. We watched Slayer, I remember, because I was just about to start working with them. We watched a lot of cool stuff. I remember it was a really fun experience.

[00:23:29.380] - Speaker 1
I don't know how we got it made, the record.

[00:23:32.240] - Speaker 2
We weren't really allowed. I don't know if you know, but really, originally, the plan was I was going to remix two songs. That's correct. Then when we went to remix them, I realized if we were to strip it down and get to the essence of it, it wasn't recorded in a way where you could do that because it was so layered in the way it was formed. You couldn't get to the essence. The essence was this produced thing. If we wanted to get to the raw thing, the only way we could do that would be to play it. We played it and we did the two, and then they sounded good, and then we said, Let's just keep doing it, and we did. But no one really gave us permission to do that. There was no record company that approved that happening.

[00:24:19.400] - Speaker 1
Oh, no, they did not. We did not have any approval.

[00:24:22.840] - Speaker 2
But it just happened.

[00:24:24.000] - Speaker 1
Because when we actually called them and told them what we've been doing for several weeks, they just about lost their wigs.

[00:24:29.460] - Speaker 2
Wow, I They didn't know that.

[00:24:31.140] - Speaker 1
I said, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. I think Ian and Alan came over, Ian Grant and Alan came over to listen. And we explained to them what we've been doing. Said, we want to hear the finished product. And I'm like, Well, wait a minute. Sit down. Just give us a sec. When we played Andy putting on, played it back to them and they were like, oh, oh, wow. That is a scene change. Because nobody had done that. I mean, you were definitely encouraging it.

[00:25:07.420] - Speaker 2
For sure.

[00:25:08.680] - Speaker 1
You were quite naughty.

[00:25:11.460] - Speaker 2
I believed. I'm a true believer. I speak from the heart and I mean it. It's not a...

[00:25:19.740] - Speaker 1
Oh, my goodness. It was perfect for me because I was like, .

[00:25:26.820] - Speaker 2
Let's go. You definitely saw what was It was possible.

[00:25:30.560] - Speaker 1
As soon as I saw you and your world and the city and everything and what you were sharing with us, it was like, Oh, this is tribe. This is the way.

[00:25:40.300] - Speaker 2
And then I remember you had your friend, Huggis, come join us, and he was really fun to be around Well, Huggis was interesting in the sense that he played with Zodiac, Mark Manning, who was a friend.

[00:25:52.220] - Speaker 1
And all of a sudden, Steven, Huggis, Steven Harris is hanging out. I think Billy had been chatting with him. It came through Billy. I didn't really know. He was like, I'm in New York, I'm hanging out. And I was like, Cool. And he come and hang out. I remember George sitting there and go, Cool. It was cool. I was I think we'd get to dope until we met Matt, Matt Dyke. But he comes in the mix, Kid Chaos from Zodiac. And the story he told me was that he'd left the band or had been kicked out the band. And I was like, because it felt like a weird The weird thing with some of these cardinal rule is you don't mess with other people's relationships amongst gentlemen. So I felt a little bit awkward, but I loved him. It was a great dude. I really enjoyed his energy. And he was into what we were into. But then I got a phone call in the middle of the night, like 4: 00 or 5: 00 in the morning from Mark, from Zodiac. He's like, What are you doing? You're trying to break up my band.

[00:26:58.820] - Speaker 1
I was like, No, bro. He's told us he's not with you anymore. And I was like, Oh, no. This is awkward. I think we're drinking quite heavily. I know I was. I used to roll in drunk. So I'll drink wine coolers because they were a little bit lighter. But then I drink six pack of wine coolers and come in the studio and get going. And a couple of slices of pizza and we were levered trousers. Let's go.

[00:27:27.860] - Speaker 2
Music always sounded better when pizza arrived, I remember.

[00:27:30.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was interesting how all of a sudden there's a lot of visitors came round about pizza time, dinner time. All of a sudden, all these people from Def Jam or whatever would pop by. Friends would pop by. George would pop by. Mr. Rick would pop by. Mr. Rick? Yeah, of course.

[00:27:50.940] - Speaker 2
He was incredible. I don't remember him coming to the studio, but that's amazing that he did.

[00:27:56.350] - Speaker 1
They were all around. Amazing. I mean, the beast. I A day, we'd come for a free piece. I walk in the studio one day and they're on the gear bashing. It's like, out. Because they were very naughty boys. I remember going out with them and throwing eggs at people every night. We all went out to the MTV New Year's Ball. I had an American Express card. I remember we were thinking about it. We were working that day. We were working New Year's Eve. Yeah, I remember that.

[00:28:27.260] - Speaker 2
I remember thinking, why would anybody If anyone to take off on either New Year's Eve or Christmas? We get to go in the studio and make music. What could be better than this? That was fantastic. It really felt like a celebration what we were doing.

[00:28:39.460] - Speaker 1
I don't think we wanted it to end. We were having such a good time because there was no adults in the room telling us what to do. No. There was no A&R guy. No. But believe me, after that record, when we did Sonic Temple, there was A&R guys floating around, hovering, whispering. It took me a minute to work out that they weren't my friends. Yeah.

[00:29:00.000] - Speaker 2
That was one of the great things about you guys coming from the UK to make the record is that there was nobody with you. You just came and we got to do our thing. I remember someone from Warner Brothers came to visit and he was cool. Do you remember Jeff Fenster came to visit? And I think Stephen Baker might have come to visit.

[00:29:17.160] - Speaker 1
Stephen Baker was a massive ally. Since day one, he was incredibly important. So was Jeff Aaroff.

[00:29:23.240] - Speaker 2
Great guy. Jeff Aaroff as well.

[00:29:24.970] - Speaker 1
I mean, they loved music. Yeah.

[00:29:28.440] - Speaker 2
How did the cover come about? I I love the cover. I don't know the story of the cover.

[00:29:32.040] - Speaker 1
I think the cover came about from a couple of things. One was my obsession with San Francisco, '60s, San Francisco, and what was happening there because Bill Graham was an actual mentor to me. We played, we reopened the Filmwell West after the Love album, so it might have been '86. I didn't know that. The divinal was opening for us. And that's when I first met Bill Graham. And then Bill Graham was like, We're in it. It wasn't the first time in The Hate because we went there in '84. But I was obsessed with what happened at Monterey Pop Festival. Seeing those images of Brian Jones with Nico and Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and Bill Graham, Jim Marshall. He introduced me to Jim Marshall, photographer. So I was obsessed with it. I was obsessed with all the psychedelic art, Matheson Kelly, Rick Griffin. And I was scribbling around and did some vaguely ersatz version of of his font, which the art director that came in was Storm Thorgensen, the man that designed Dark Side of the Moon. Storm comes in and there was Aubrey Powell, But at that point, Storm was off. He'd broken off from hypnosis.

[00:30:49.700] - Speaker 1
So somehow, I think through the label, not Beggus Banquet, but maybe through the Americans, I'm not quite sure how the relationship came about, but I had this vague idea of a psychedelic cover. So it was a collaboration with Storm Thorgensen. And then Rick Griffin saw the font. He's like, Hey, that's my style. And we started talking. He goes, I love you guys. Can I do something? So he did the Wildflower sleeve. Amazing. That was Rick Griffin did that. Amazing. That was his font.

[00:31:16.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah. That wasn't even the fake Rick Griffin font. Yeah, it was real Rick Griffin.

[00:31:20.660] - Speaker 1
That was real Rick Griffin. That was just a love affair with San Francisco and everything that went with it from Timothée Leary to Gainsbourg to, I mean, Pig Pen, you name it, George Harrison walking down H street. I mean, there was so much packed in from the... Alan Watts comes from England as an Anglican priest convert into Zen Buddhism. He becomes the guru of the beats, Kerouac, Gainsberg. He's the man. He's from Leatherhead. Strangely, near Chiselhurst Caves, where Jimi Hendrix played, there were so many ley lines connecting. I could just feel the frequency. And the cover came out of that.

[00:32:03.440] - Speaker 2
I think your love of the lore, the history, the music, the people, the looks, the smells of it all is why you've always been able to embody it. It's like through osmosis. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like you've dedicated yourself to it like a student. I think that's what makes the best things. It was never work. It It was never a job. It was never a means to an end. You were practicing a devotional act in participating in this thing you love so much.

[00:32:42.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah, God speaks through the airwaves. The Goddess, the divine mystery came to me through the airwaves, and that was my connection to source other, not tactile, impermanence. It all came through the musical frequency, which, according to the big bang, theorists, quantum level, the big bang is B flat, and it's still frequency is still going. Some musicians are tapped the real intuitive ones, the emotionally intelligent ones are tapped into that, and they're just going to do it whatever. If they're playing to their cat, it doesn't matter. The numbers don't matter. The accolades don't matter. It's this devotional act, as you say. And it doesn't befuddle me. I just listen. Listen with a heart, listen with an open heart and pick a bomb, give you a vibration. It's not like coming out here is like a bomb going off for me. Silence. A bomb of silence and the ocean in the rear view mirrors, I'm pulling up. And then I'm thinking about it. I'm going, wait a minute. I'm going to see Rick. I haven't seen him for decades. This is somebody I love dearly. And I'm looking It's like, wait a minute, where you are, Shangri-La, Dylan, the bus, the oceans in the rear of your mirror.

[00:34:05.240] - Speaker 1
I'm going, wait a minute. What is this oasis? Because it does have the same frequency as the Ochoa Ashram in Pune or the Potala Palace in Tibet. Why is that? The same frequency is present within. Perhaps it's something to do with I'm now in tune. The environment allows me to tune my chakras, tune my vibrational frequencies, and drop in. Yes. Drop into it. Yes. Make sure you got lead in your boots, though. Because you can get all dreamy and caught up in it. When I walked in here, I was like, the esthetic, it's very austere. Yoko Ohno is probably lurking somewhere. It feels very Lennon white room, Ohno. I was almost going to wear a plastic Oh No band T-shirt today. I thought, I can't broadcast that because in the cult recently, I've been, which is a small part of my creative life, but in the tactile world. I've been obsessed, obsessing on plastic Oh No band and Liverpool because I'm gone back there and I don't know, it just popped up.

[00:35:24.160] - Speaker 2
Lennon, Oh No. When you went back, how different was it than what you remember from childhood?

[00:35:28.820] - Speaker 1
Well, we went back, the last Last time we went back, we just did a show at Demont for the Hall, which is a student venue. I didn't really walk around the city. When I went back in the '90s, because I went there to make a record with a band called the Holy Barbarians, which was really an excuse to do the things I didn't get to do when I was a object or a racehorse in the stable of Warner Brothers on Beggers Banquet in the industrial complex of being an iconic singer and an iconic MTV. It dissolved into this product. And I couldn't... I know that we had several attempts where you almost came in as a interventionist. I remember that.

[00:36:13.160] - Speaker 2
I remember that because I had a memory of us in Sound City together. I remember we made Electric in New York. That's correct. At Electric Lady, I remember the experience like, What are we doing at Sound City? And I couldn't figure it out. So I didn't remember what we did. But now I remember we We heard a song that was incredibly cool.

[00:36:31.960] - Speaker 1
Yeah, we did The Witcher.

[00:36:33.580] - Speaker 2
The Witcher. Did it ever come out?

[00:36:36.440] - Speaker 1
The Witcher did come out in '93. Oh, great. In '93. That's good.

[00:36:38.560] - Speaker 2
So then we can hear it.

[00:36:39.560] - Speaker 1
But The Witcher came out in '93, and The Witcher, to me, was like, This is the way. Yeah.

[00:36:45.040] - Speaker 2
Can we listen to that now? Do you mind? Absolutely. I haven't heard it since then. I'm really curious to see what it is.

[00:36:50.160] - Speaker 1
You're actually on it.

[00:36:51.240] - Speaker 2
No.

[00:36:51.960] - Speaker 1
Listen, you'll hear it.

[00:36:53.540] - Speaker 2
How can it be?

[00:36:54.440] - Speaker 1
Your voice is on it.

[00:36:55.600] - Speaker 2
I really have no recollection of what it is other than remembering it.

[00:36:59.040] - Speaker 1
It was really cool. I know how it got It's not made.

[00:37:00.980] - Speaker 2
Let's see.

[00:37:09.340] - Speaker 1
Oh, it's filfy. So you finally pan your rhythm, man. Got you, fuck your ass out of the thing. Well, the girl is coming to you, I'm going to show you what is true. When she needs a love, then maybe it could be you to have to understand. Oh, yeah. It's all that he told me to love me. Yeah. Took a while to understand. Oh, yeah. But she said something right away. Their dreams are coming true. They said they weren't true. The world needs a baby boy. Then it could be you took a while to

[00:39:33.980] - Speaker 1
She is good at what you need. What you got is good. She's good at what you need. I have a bitch here, it's coming to you.

[00:39:50.800] - Speaker 2
So cute.

[00:39:52.140] - Speaker 1
It's dark. So cute.

[00:40:00.000] - Speaker 2
You're there.

[00:40:00.760] - Speaker 1
No, check that break out. Before that, the break where you clicked it off. Stop it. There's a break where I can hear your voice distinctly, but the way it was recorded was I did the demo in Toronto in '90. My father died in 1990. We were on tour early 1990. But I was in Toronto. I think I did it in a Christmas break in '89 off to Sonic Temple tour. We even did 63 shows with Metallica. We did 187 shows on that tour. I mean, we were burnt out. We were burnt out. I got sober I was down on that tour and my dad was dying of cancer. And I was listening to this music coming out of... I remember Peter Hook taking me to the factory to see the rave culture was coming out. He said, You got to check Peter Hook, the bass player from bloody Joy Division. I'm only 26, 27 years old and I'm watching this. I'm going, I feel ancient. This music's phenomenal. And plus I love hip hop because we were playing NWA at the PA every night before we went on. That was the opening music. That was the walking music.

[00:41:18.060] - Speaker 1
That's what people heard. That's what I was telling them to play. If you want to play rock, I'm like, no, this is what's happening. So the bass line is, of course, from Echo It's Roger Waters. Really? Obsessed. Like Pompei when they're going, that's Roger Waters, the bass line. And I just went to spell up, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, and he hits this, gang, gang, gang, boom, boom, boom. And I heard that in my head and I was like, somehow this goes with the rave culture and hip hop and the cynic The energy of Floyd. And a bomb went off in my head. So I cut this track. It was originally called Northern Man. Northern Man, You Got Rhythm. But you, when you got hold of it, you were working with Matt and you had a pile of breaks. I remember you going through that. We sat with 12 inches. It was at your house near the Chateau, and you were just going through it, going there, that one, that one, that one. And you picked out the breaks for the samples.

[00:42:26.360] - Speaker 2
And then we just built it.

[00:42:27.430] - Speaker 1
You built it. And then we went in, we had the bass I think George might have actually played the bass.

[00:42:32.040] - Speaker 2
Sounds like it.

[00:42:32.740] - Speaker 1
George played the bass because I could play it, but I couldn't play as well as he could play it. And you cut the track and the counts of the changes is you counting three, four.

[00:42:41.580] - Speaker 2
So we know what to do.

[00:42:42.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but then after we got this basic track and Northern Man didn't fit. And we'd been offered this movie, Cool World. Oh, yeah. That's what it was for. It was a big movie.

[00:42:53.220] - Speaker 2
I couldn't remember why we did it. That's why Cool World soundtrack.

[00:42:56.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Ralph Baschke. Yeah. We did Fritz the Cat and everything. So it was a pretty dope film. And that was through maybe like Jeff Aeroff at Warner Brothers. Let's do this track. And it was also a way of me attempting to maintain. It was like an intervention. We were very close. We were sharing what we were into. And I was so excited. I'm like, it's going to happen.

[00:43:20.860] - Speaker 2
We were making experimental music.

[00:43:22.530] - Speaker 1
We were. But Billy wasn't on it. He wasn't in the room when that was being happening. I think somebody said, it was probably you said, we should get Billy to play on this. I'm like, yeah.

[00:43:32.380] - Speaker 2
And he did. No, he did. He ripped it. It raises the whole vibration of it.

[00:43:38.380] - Speaker 1
It's great. That's his gift. That's what he really is excellent at is that. When he's off the leash. He's filthy when he just lets himself go. And I see that and I'm like, That is incredible. We still play that track in cult sets.

[00:43:55.820] - Speaker 2
And now-How does it sound live?

[00:43:58.100] - Speaker 1
It's a behemoth. Yeah. We rip.

[00:44:01.900] - Speaker 2
It's so groovy.

[00:44:03.170] - Speaker 1
It cuts through like a knife. And you can see the audience are just swaying. They're in it. Everybody's in it. We're so in it. It stands up. I'm playing Maracas on it. It's still got a bit of Stones in it.

[00:44:19.420] - Speaker 2
For sure. I hear that. I don't remember hearing that then, but I hear it now. Yeah.

[00:44:24.780] - Speaker 1
I mean, the film was massive. It came and went. It was released as a standalone single, maybe 12-inch. We had a white cover with a white pentagram on it. Done. Done. Done and dusted. But there should have been a whole album around that. And that's what I was saying to B at the time. I was like, this is it because that is done. This is done. The hair is coming off. This is finished. And it was great where it lasted. It was fun. Parties over. We're going here now. And everybody was like, You're insane. We can't do this. And I just fought them tooth and nail, just fought them. I was trying to reintegrate our relationship and what our vision was because at that point, there was a disturbance in the force. We'd become a piece of property.

[00:45:14.280] - Speaker 2
It is a point in time in success when there's a feeling of it's not yours anymore and it's being controlled by someone else. And it might not even be business people. It might be some psychological It's a logical thing to do with the audience, that the audience has certain expectations, and you can't upset that when in reality, you really can.

[00:45:37.940] - Speaker 1
Oh, no, we did. No, we upset them early.

[00:45:40.530] - Speaker 2
You can, and you can switch it up. But there is that feeling of it's a dangerous move.

[00:45:47.060] - Speaker 1
It wasn't the audience. It wasn't that. For me, it wasn't. It wasn't that. It was that my partner was transfixed like a deer in the headlights by maybe the validation, I don't know, but caught up in the lifestyle and everything. And I was still on the mission.

[00:46:08.050] - Speaker 2
This brings us back to you. I remember the first thing you guys said when you came, I think you flew into JFK, you came into the city. We met for the first time, and I remember the conversation was, we know what song is going to be the first single from the album because it's the same cords as our last hit. And I said, Well, if it has the same cords as your last hit, not only can it not be the first single, I don't think it can be on the album because you did that.

[00:46:42.510] - Speaker 1
Exactly.

[00:46:43.980] - Speaker 2
So that's the difference in mentality. Whereas there is a mentality in the music business of, It worked last time, let's just do it again.

[00:46:54.000] - Speaker 1
Everybody was hypnotized by format, structure, architecture, Sure. Like even a seven-inch single, the format artists would write to the format of a seven-inch single. That was already pre-programmed. Libra and Stroll. Little Richard were writing these. There was format, format, format. The tail was wagging the dog. It was unspoken. Some bands were breaking it, like the Germans with Kraut Rock, like Popol Vuh and stuff like that.

[00:47:21.580] - Speaker 2
Or Steerway to Heaven for that matter. Steerway to Heaven.

[00:47:23.860] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. Absolutely. Breaking the Malt. Or especially the bass player in the cult now is Charlie Jones, who's married to Carmen Plant, and he played with Plant and Page. So he brings a provenance as another empathetic. We don't talk about rock, we talk about Alice Coltrane. He's such a gift to us. It's a completely different band than it was even five years ago. But I think format is a very interesting thing where unconsciously you're in format, you're in culture. The culture is responding to format, which is really driven by the advertisers, popular culture, the controllers of culture, controllers of advertising, Condinast, whomever it is, Vanguard, Viacom, And somebody's getting paid. But we just are hypnotized. We go on for, unless you have a eureka moment where you go, you're a Sid Barrett. You're just wired differently. And you question it. Right now, I'm doing exactly the same thing as I was when I was a teeny tiny.

[00:48:36.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because you're you. I question it all the time because I'm me. It's our nature.

[00:48:43.200] - Speaker 1
It is our nature. It's our nature. It's like you go, Turn it over. You smell this side of it. Yeah.

[00:48:51.700] - Speaker 2
That's good, too.

[00:48:55.160] - Speaker 1
Whatever it is, however you get into it, right? But I think a lot of it's just processing I also like being surprised by it.

[00:49:02.680] - Speaker 2
I like when it's not the same. I like that feeling of it can't be different for the sake of being different because that's not good. But when it's different and you love it, that's really exciting. That's my favorite. When you're leaning forward because you're not sure what's going to happen next, it's the best feeling.

[00:49:24.100] - Speaker 1
Yes, there's a lot of music out there right now that just surprises me. When I hear it for the first time, I'm like, Wait a minute. Did I hear that correctly? Yeah. Is this possible? Yeah.

[00:49:34.920] - Speaker 2
Now? It's the best feeling. Today?

[00:49:36.840] - Speaker 1
Best feeling. In this world, in this climate? Yeah. Occasionally, I come across a few nuggets just as a fan of music. But then I go like, I'm going to do it my own anyway. Of course. So I have a mountain of amassed. I feel like a Henry Dajer, just undiscovered Shambala sitting in my I'm going to put my phone in multitracks. They're in some storage space somewhere that I'm going to pull out for my solo record I made in the desert with Chris Gaston '96, '97. I know there's good stuff in there. Yeah, of course. That we can rewire and brutalize on format, which is my whole thing right now. I'm going, why don't we just take the entire catalog of everything we've ever done and put it through a shredder? See what that sounds like. We're an AI program.

[00:50:31.240] - Speaker 2
Tell me about Southern Death Cult. What was the Southern Death Cult? Oh, wow.

[00:50:37.900] - Speaker 1
Or Southern Death Cult.

[00:50:39.480] - Speaker 2
Is that your first band?

[00:50:41.040] - Speaker 1
Southern Death Cult was... Well, actually, no. The very, very, very first time I stepped into a room with musicians with the intention of creating a band, there was two. There was one called Send No flowers in Liverpool. I think we had one or two rehearsals, and they actually went on to do something, released a single. Then I was in Belfast as a homeless kid, and I was living in a squat with these punks, and we had one song. I was reading the island Dr. Moreau by H. G. Wells. There was this thing about vivisection, experimenting on animals. And there was a line in there, not to walk on all fours, are we not men? Divo may have used this one. I saw that as a lyric and I was like, oh, that's interesting. And it just came up with drum beat. Not to walk on all fours, are we not men? And that was a song. And the other guys in the house had some terrible four strings on a guitar, and we were called Children of Lust.

[00:51:43.560] - Speaker 2
Did you ever do a gig or never?

[00:51:45.410] - Speaker 1
Never. We played in the front room of a damp squat in Belfast in 1980, which was a pretty rough place. It wasn't something you wanted to be in a band. It was just that everybody was obsessed with music. And there's always instruments around of some description. Then I ended up leaving Belfast and following Crass, the band Crass. I remember Crass. Devotee of Crass. Followed them, stayed in Steve Ingrunst TP, went to the house. Did you really? Oh, yeah.

[00:52:11.900] - Speaker 2
Tell me what that scene was like. I don't know anything about them. All I know are the cool album jackets had unfolded into posters.

[00:52:18.060] - Speaker 1
They started in '77 and were- Where were they based? They were based in, I believe, Epping, which would be at the The end of the central line, Dial House. They had this house. It was an old phone exchange because back in the day, you didn't have satellites. You had buildings like the AT&T building in New York, where the operators would connect you This was an old phone exchange that they converted, got hold of. It was a real mishmash of people. I think the drummer was a teacher. They've got an exhibit right now in New York as well. Of Crass. Yeah, of Crass, his artwork and the visual and everything. Gee, I believe, worked for... She was a graphic designer. Steve Ingnorent was a punk kid from London. The other ones were university dropouts and stuff like that. But they had this real vision, like very Orwellian. They lived in a very situationistic, anarchistic, communal environment. They were very set up, actually similar to Shangri-La. They all wore a utility It was military in clothing. It was died black. Everything was died black. They had banners which had the cross with the snake wrapped around them and the destroy power, not people, banners, and became a devote of them and the philosophy and followed them like the first album, Feeling of the 5,000, opening it, looking at the graphics and going, This is phenomenal.

[00:53:50.920] - Speaker 1
This is what Joe Strom is saying. This is what Leiden is saying. But they're really living it. Yes. They had a commune. They grew their own food. It's the first time I taste the tempura. They opened my mind to so many things. I'm eating Japanese food in a garden, napping in the middle of summer. Got to visit them a couple of times there. Anyway, so through the crass tour, as I was a homeless person, we went through a city called Bradford, north of England, near Leeds, which is considered to be the center of the dark wave, Gothic. There's so many bands that came out of that scene, out of that city, that area, post-industrial. Manchester, Leeds, Huddersfield, Liverpool. I ended up getting off in a room in a house, £10 a week, and I had nowhere to live. So I just took them up. It was like moving to Kansas, really. So moving to this house. There's a band playing in the basement of the house. They were rehearsing on a band called New Model Army's Gear. They had a basic PA, 100-watt PA, and they would use the PA, and they had little amps.

[00:54:56.840] - Speaker 1
They were beating up amps. And a guitar player had guitar that he made himself. He was an art student. It was Bradford Art School. Bace player was obsessed with Adam and the Ants. The drummer, Hacknawaz Karashi, brilliant tribal drummer. He loved things like Shalimar and disco, but a lot of I think. And they had a band called Violation. The singer, let's say, had lifestyle choices. They didn't match up with these guys. They really wanted to go for it. I was living in a house. They saw me and they said, Our singer's gone. Do you want Can you jump in? Do you want to try out for the band? I'm like, Can you sing? I'm like, I don't know. So I went down to the basement. They said, Let's try something. What do you know? Like, Sex Pistols. We did a Sex Pistols song. They're going like, Wow, that sounds pretty good. Do you want to be in the band? So my spontaneous was like, Okay. And then the drummer's brother was a local promoter in the Leeds Bradford area. He was putting on bands like Antipacity GbH, all these like oi-punk bands, like post-post-punk bands, post-anarcho, post...

[00:56:05.060] - Speaker 1
Because by this time, the clash had become combat rock. It had become something else. The pistols were gone. The original McLaren Westwood scene, door broken up. So this is another generation of punk bands who really were disenfranchised working class kids. A local TV station, Yorkshire Television, was making a documentary on unemployed youth cultures. Kids were making art who were unemployed, basically living like young scavengers. The drummer's brother got a whiff of this and he said, They're making a documentary. Do you guys want to be in it? We're like, What? We had three songs. By this time, we were rehearsing above a reggae shop called Roots Records. Our first real audience were Rastafarians. There was Watchers Play. So these Rasters, Watchers Play had these three songs, and we got offered to be part of this TV documentary. And of course, that was like a spaceship had just landed. Somebody said, Do you want to get on and go for a ride? We were like, Okay. It's like 18 years old. So we did this whole couple of days where they filmed us. They set up the first gig in a pub where they got like 80 kids in, punks.

[00:57:15.660] - Speaker 2
And you'd never done a gig before?

[00:57:17.130] - Speaker 1
Never walked on a stage. Wow. I actually have been in a school play, but never as a musician, not as a lead singer. And we didn't have a name. And the TV station was like, What's the name of the band? So I was reading a book on Native American Anthropology, and there's this one paragraph talking about the, I think it's the Hopewell Valley in Ohio, a certain group of Native Americans that had these serpent mounds. It's people there. I referred to them as the Southern Death Cult because they worshiped skulls. And they'd incorporate death into their spiritual view of the world. Death was a thing which in the West, we tried to avoid at all costs. The Tibettans all day long, death is part of it, impermanence. So that became the name of the band, Southern Death Cult. I picked it out and went, This is a great name. It is a great name. It's a great name. Sounds dope. And the government and the controls in the south, it was very good for a basic get in, but it just resonated with me. And that was our first gig. It was a film for television.

[00:58:21.160] - Speaker 1
Tapes are gone. I think I saw it once. And when it aird, they can't find the tapes. They're gone. But it did happen. And then the first gig we play within- What was the experience like of seeing yourself on TV for the first time? Well, the experience of going on stage for the first time, the amount of adrenaline is inexplicable. I mean, it was like I got hit by a car when I was a kid, which was a life-changing experience. Plus, I had some bad experiences with psychedelics. But this was something otherworldly, similar to the Pink Floyd experience at 13. A similar lightning shock went through the chakras. So this was Southern Death Cult. And then we did our first gig in an unemployed, an narco commune place called One In Twelve Club. It means One In Twelve is employed. So we played this gig, we packed it out, 150 people in a room, and that was it. We thought we were like, Wow, what's the next thing? We did a couple of gigs in local area. We opened for Chelsea. It was our fourth gig at a club. It was a punk band from '77, one of the peripheral punk bands, but still Jean October was very important.

[00:59:36.360] - Speaker 1
James Stevenson on the guitar, parallel to Generation X, came out in London punk scene. We opened for them and they offered us a gig at the Marquis. Do you want to come to the Marquis? I know for a Marquis in London, Gig 5. Wow. Got six songs. We're like, What? The Marquis in London. That is Mecca. It was a mythical place. Yeah.

[01:00:01.000] - Speaker 2
You've never been there before.

[01:00:02.630] - Speaker 1
Not to Marquis, no. I've been on the streets in London. Slept in Kings Cross train station, stayed in a squat with a lot of punks in West Amsterdam, but nothing like this. This was different. We had a purpose. We had a mission. So we hired a van. We got snowed in Yorkshire. It was 200-a-hour drive. The driver was called Neil, and he was a hippie. We called him Neil the Hippy, and he had a headband. I got mine from Edward Curtis, pictures The bandanas came from Edward Curtis, pictures of indigenous Apaches. Auspiciously, Dino Predis, as you know very well, is part Chiracua Apache, now manages the cult. Anyway, we got out the snowstorm, got to London, got there, Grabbed a kebab in Soho, Seedy Soho, went into the marquee, did a little soundcheck, got ready, which meant opening a plastic bag and changing a T-shirt, 10 cigarettes in a little packet. That's all we could afford two cans of beer on the stage. There's 30 people there. I think Lemmy was actually on the Fruit Machines because he was always in Soho on the gambling machines. And then we had a friend who was living in London who was running around the Bow Wow Wow crew, like Westwood and Bow Wow Wow.

[01:01:16.440] - Speaker 1
He's fully dressed in pirate costume. And he kept jumping on stage, he pulled out cables and laughing. And this was our big moment in the Marquis in London. It was a total disaster. It was horrible. We were so miserable. And plus, Gino And October wouldn't give us the money, £35, for the petrol money to go back to Bradford. We had to get it out of him. And I remember standing at the bar when Chester on stage and I was drinking half a lager. And this guy comes up to me and goes, Hi, my name's Paul Boswell. I'm from this agency called The Agency or whatever it's called. I'm like, great. I said, what do you do? Do you do light, sound? So I'm an agent. I've booked bands. I'm like, okay, great. He said he wrote his name, his number down a bit of paper, stuck in my pocket, didn't I think anything of it. We were unconsolable. We got in the van, drove back to Bradford that night. On the way back, just like Control, the film which illustrates him, Kurt has been an epileptic. It's the same thing. One blanket in the back, a drum was an epileptic.

[01:02:16.220] - Speaker 1
We had to pull over. He has an epileptic trauma. It was so heavy. And when we got back to Bradford, we were just like, the adrenaline was gone. We're now crashing. We're like, Well, that was a complete and utter burnout. We were so unconsolable. And then the following week, there's a review in Sounds. It says, Chelsea, Sudden Death Cult, Marquee, London. First line says, I have seen the future at Southern Death Cult. And I'm like, oh, what? Unbelievable. You're kidding me. Unbelievable. So we ran around. We didn't have telephone. I think we had a pay phone in our house. So we were pay phoning each other And we go like, Right, now we got to get to work. So the drummer's brother, again, RAP, comes in with Aki and he says, Look, I've got the number of some of the agencies. You want to start calling them, see if there's any gigs, tours? We knew The Clash would pick up local support bands, and Aki was talking about The Clash. I think violation may be a vote for The Clash. So we were calling these agencies and I got this mom phone number and I didn't even take the phone number out of my pocket that Paul Boswell had given it to me.

[01:03:28.380] - Speaker 1
So I called this agency and I called them And I'm on a pay phone at home, I remember. And secretary picks up the phone. She's like, Hi, who's this? I said, seeing from a band called Sudden Death Coach. She goes, What band is? She says, Sudden Death Coach. She says, Wait a minute. Okay. Who gets on the phone? Hey, it's Paul. Don't you remember I met you at the Marquis? I'm like, Oh, yeah. Hi, Paul. He said, We've been trying to get hold of you guys. We got five dates penciled in the theater of fate. I'm like, What? You did what? What? Unbelievable. Okay. And hung the phone and then started calling everyone and go like, The Theater of Hate Tour. They just been on top of the pops. We were like, mind's blown. So that was it. Like, gig six, seven, eight, nine was Theater of Hate. Then we went into Bauhaus. It sounds so amazing. Then we went for The Clash. Yeah. It did all of that.

[01:04:15.120] - Speaker 2
What's amazing is the thing that seemed like the thing that didn't work at all, the club at the Marquis that you drove home miserable.

[01:04:26.080] - Speaker 1
Oh, we were miserable.

[01:04:28.060] - Speaker 2
Was actually the turning point that started the whole thing. The thing that, again, in the moment you couldn't see, it seemed like a terrible experience, and that started the whole thing.

[01:04:40.860] - Speaker 1
It's amazing.

[01:04:42.300] - Speaker 2
We never know.

[01:04:43.420] - Speaker 1
You never know.

[01:04:44.230] - Speaker 2
We never know.

[01:04:45.020] - Speaker 1
You never know. You have no idea. That's why it's good to stay open. It's all a possibility. If you're trying to hang your head on a certain nail, don't get stuck there.

[01:04:57.600] - Speaker 2
Tell me about opening for The Clash. Were Clash a big deal for you personally? Personally, yeah.

[01:05:01.720] - Speaker 1
Do you love The Clash? I loved The Clash. I saw them in '79 on the 16 Tons tour. I mean, got Santanista the day it came out. Because I was living in Canada, I missed the first two albums. Give them enough rope and Clash. But Santanista came out. I remember getting that, obsessed with The Clash.

[01:05:17.050] - Speaker 2
London Calling.

[01:05:18.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, London Calling. They were touring that, summer Glasgow, Paulo. Loved The Clash. I remember Mick Jones? They were doing White Riott. He didn't like playing it because the connotations of the song, he thought it was a little bit It didn't like the politics of it. It threw this Les Paul up in the air. I remember it had one of those curly leads. All I can remember from the gig is this guitar going throwing so high. And as it's coming down, he's in a white boiler suit. He just turned around and walked away from it and she went, smash. I was like, what? The whole audience was like, that's the most visceral memory I have of that concert is this guitar just going to Shards. Anyway, for Combatt Rock, the date that we got offered after making the phone calls was at Stoke Hanley, Victoria Hall. I was on the Combatt Rock tour, which was essentially the last tour.

[01:06:07.220] - Speaker 2
At that time, they were really a big band.

[01:06:11.400] - Speaker 1
Oh, they were massive. But with the punks in the UK, they'd gone to America. And that was like, no, no. Because they were ours. But I didn't feel that way because I was North American teenager, essentially. I understood it. They went for the who. Shane Stateman over there. But When they came back with Tiger Stripes and such dope style engineer's boots, they looked phenomenal. We were all trying to copy their style. And if you look at early Southern Death Cult, you see Billy and Full Tiger Stroke.

[01:06:43.260] - Speaker 2
When did it change from Southern Death Cult to Death Cult?

[01:06:45.460] - Speaker 1
It changed. Well, basically what happened was with Southern Death Cult, it was happening too quickly. Within the space of 11, 12 months, we were getting offers from EMI. We did demos for EMI. Beggers Banquet was sniffing around. And then came CBS Records. They said, 100 grand, bang, on a table. We want you guys. When that money came on the table, I looked it out and went, We're trying to warn a chapel for publishing. Give us £500 each. Scandals. But there was a lot of heat in the band. There was a lot of heat on the band. We did The Tube, and Malcolm McLaren was on it. And his comment was, That boy is a sexual threat. I go, As a kid, I didn't know what that meant. But as it got older, it was like, Malcolm McLaren said that?

[01:07:34.740] - Speaker 2
Pretty good.

[01:07:35.310] - Speaker 1
Oh, because I'm obsessing on Malcolm McLaren as well right now. I'm reading his biography by Paul Gorman, which is staggering.

[01:07:41.560] - Speaker 2
The man was a brilliant, brilliant genius.

[01:07:45.760] - Speaker 1
But when that heat started to come on the band, my natural instinct was to pivot away from it because it felt like a trap, didn't feel authentic. What they wanted was our youth. What they wanted was our vitality, and that we were the band of the moment. It's a CBS. They were all looking for the next Pistols. They all wanted that phenomenal thing. And it was Southern Death Gold at the time. It was on the front cover of the enemy without even having a record out. Shot by Anton Corbin in '82. Incredible. So that was the heat on the band. And I just said, you know what? I can't do it. I just can't do it. And I remember them pleading with me like, Please don't leave. And I was like... Plus, I remember I had a song. It wasn't called spirit walk at the time, but it was like... And I had this thing and they didn't want to play it. I had written Moya and flower in the desert, two songs that we'd recorded. We never made an album. I was beginning to feel my own path. And I'm It's like, this doesn't feel like it should be staying here.

[01:08:48.080] - Speaker 1
This is going to last 10 minutes because it would corrupt us. We all have four different personalities pulling in four different... Had we had a Brian Epstein or had we had a George Martin come in the room or Rick Rubin come in the room, It may have been a very different story. We didn't have that patriarchal oak tree. We didn't have a guide. We didn't have somebody to like, okay, guys, that's the external experience. Let's get in your feet. Let's get in your place. Let's get grounded. Let's focus on getting the material together, getting the creativity, focusing, doing the work.

[01:09:22.260] - Speaker 2
So you felt like it was too rushed?

[01:09:26.000] - Speaker 1
It felt rushed. It felt like all of a sudden, people who had their hands all over us When we were like, as people, we're not considered. The external field that we were putting out there was what they wanted. They wanted to mine as far. Nutrients. I've heard an American I and our guy talk about churn and burn. Overheard a conversation at dinners like, Oh, yeah, churn and burn. These kids coming through, we just churn and burn. There's no churn and burn here because I'm out. So I walked away from that. I didn't have a penny. I was still unemployed. Billy was working in a clothing shop. He got kicked out of theory of fate. He was the only guitar player I've met that I liked. And I thought he had something.

[01:10:11.300] - Speaker 2
Why was he kicked out?

[01:10:13.060] - Speaker 1
Because he was from Manchester, probably, and they were from the South. So it was like a cultural divide. Plus, really, he was very pragmatic. And the lead singer was really the poet and the visionary. And his manager was a great facilitator. Terry Razor was a poet as well. I don't think Billy just fit their profile. But anyway, he was working in a clothing store in London. I knew Billy, knew where he worked. Got in a coach, left Bradford, had a plastic bag, T-shirt, cigarettes, can of beer, some lyrics. Turned up in a clothing shop, said, Hey. I walk in, he goes, Hey, what's up? I said, Left a band. He said, You did what? I said, Left a band. Do you want to start a band? You're insane. You've done what? He was left out. I said, Yeah. So next thing, I'm sleeping on his couch in Brixton. That's the beginning of Deaths cult. Because I came up with the name Sudden Deaths cult, I just went... Because I wanted to distinguish two different bands. So we wrote Deaths cult.

[01:11:07.650] - Speaker 2
And it was different.

[01:11:08.820] - Speaker 1
It was very different. It was very different. Our first drummer, Raymond Taylor-Smith, his father was the diplomat from Sierra Leone. So he was an African kid. He could play amazing tribal beats. It was a band called Rytual. We went to see this band called Rytual. And Jamie Stewart was playing rhythm guitar in a band. I said to Billy, I said, That drummer is unbelievable. Rytual plays really good as well. Let's try and get these guys. I remember I was drunk. I was lying upside down on the stairs. It was like an old theater, and I was in the aisle, lying upside down, watching them going This is incredible. We got to do a band with these guys. So Raymond came in. We just grabbed him and said, We got a record deal. We're doing this. They left their band straight away. No loyalty at all. There's no loyalty.

[01:12:00.000] - Speaker 2
How would you describe the difference in the energy in you between Southern Death Cult and Death Cult?

[01:12:06.580] - Speaker 1
I was becoming a veteran of lived experience. So I knew beginning to understand how it all worked. They don't want you. They want it. Whatever you're putting out, they meaning direct company people, the people that you think of your friends, the replacement patriarks and matriarks. They want your essence. They want your soul. I signed my publishing contract in blood. I was that dramatic a kid. I was like, slashed my hand. I was like, yeah.

[01:12:42.460] - Speaker 2
That's amazing. Yeah. I was amazing.

[01:12:44.680] - Speaker 1
So into romanticism. Committed. Committed. Yes. I'm still committed. Yeah. Still on that contract. Also, the times were pretty oppressive. A death cult was like me and Billy against the world, and now we really had to pull it together.

[01:13:03.700] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the scene at that time. What would have been the bands that you might have gone to see at that point in time?

[01:13:09.010] - Speaker 1
Well, I remember going to see when I first stayed with Billy, we went to Ziggypop. It was in the venue in London, near Victoria Train Station, Ziggypop. We got to Lyceum on Sunday. We see things like Johnny Thunder's. You could still access, but I was trying to go and see people like Johnny Hooker or Jerry Lee Lewis.

[01:13:28.420] - Speaker 2
But what was actually happening at the time? What was happening? What was the up and coming exciting?

[01:13:33.560] - Speaker 1
It was post-punk, positive punk. Other bands around at the time, Sister to Mercy, The Cure were massive. The Banshees were massive.

[01:13:43.440] - Speaker 2
So goth?

[01:13:45.000] - Speaker 1
Goth, although I prefer the term dark wave. When you came to America, they called it Death Rock, and I was like, Oh, that's cool. Just sounded way cool. And then Goth. But now Goth, actually.

[01:13:57.550] - Speaker 2
Cool again.

[01:13:58.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. We I'm going to talk about the dark wave in the shadow because that permeates the entire culture. Go look at America's top 20 podcasts. Murder, murder, murder, murder, entertainment, murder, matricide. It's like, what is this? We live in the shadow. So much so that I resurrected Death Cult last year for one show at The Ace.

[01:14:23.960] - Speaker 2
Great.

[01:14:24.460] - Speaker 1
Because I had to reboot the whole thing. I got to reboot the whole thing. Great. Shred it. Great.

[01:14:29.330] - Speaker 2
Death Cult, Did you have that experience?

[01:14:30.740] - Speaker 1
Oh, it was outrageous. It was outrageous. We did 10 shows in the UK, 11 shows in the UK, blew them out. It was almost like much-needed milk, sustenance. So much so that we're being asked to do Death Cult now.

[01:14:44.880] - Speaker 2
Great.

[01:14:45.700] - Speaker 1
Because it speaks to the moment, it speaks to the shadow, it speaks to the moment. But Death Cult was... Our first gig was in Oslo. We decided to play in Europe first so we'd get it together because again, we only had six, eight songs, some Southern Death Cult songs, some of the new songs that we'd written. We played Oslo, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paradies Home, Paris, Le Bandeuche, which is where Joy Division played. It was mythical. Then came back to the UK and did a tour. The reviews that came in was that you had sounds, Melody maker, and The Maker and the enemy was the Bible. And that's what everybody looked at because the journalists were way more integrated into the audience and music fans, people like Paul Morley and Charles Charles-Murray and the great writers. People were like, looks great, but not really feeling it. So all of a sudden, back to Earth again. Like, oh, I went from some death cult on the pinnacle of CBS and all of that. Next Pistols, McLaren's blessing to back down to we're in the grinder again. So we got a lot to prove. And we went away and started thinking about being songwriters.

[01:15:56.760] - Speaker 1
That was a thing now. Like, oh, we got to write some songs. Got to start working through processes, start reading more books, go into more galleries.

[01:16:06.900] - Speaker 2
Inspiration.

[01:16:07.840] - Speaker 1
Inspiration. The travel was great. But it naturally found its way. We made an ERP. We got that together, Death Gold, and made a song called God's zoo. So the lyrics were evolving. My identity was evolving. I felt like I was evolving. And as I was evolving, Billy was evolving because he was originally a rhythm guitar player, and I kept nudging him going like, Jimmy Page, like lead. Play lead. Go play lead, go listen some blues. I was pushing that on him because to me, it was like a foil. The guitar player in Sun Death Cult, I couldn't really influence. But with Billy, I basically took his record collection that was at the back of his record collection was things like Free, Zeppelin, lead players, and poured it to the front of his record collection and said, It's okay to public image. And Led Zeppelin, this is the way. We can do whatever we want. And I had this vision. If you look at some early cult from 84 Dreamtime Live, we had a song called Bonebag, which actually has a solo in it, Blues solo. You can see me I'm going to... You can actually see me looking at him going like, solo, now.

[01:17:44.290] - Speaker 1
And he's stepping up to the plate because once you step over that threshold, you got to let it go, man. And he did. And it was mesmerizing. We're not in the pantheon of all the things I was obsessed with. We were looking at it maybe with binoculars from a distance, but I could see it. I was like, we've got to get to this mountain. We've got to get to this mountain. Because when you look at early Zeppelin or you look at early Blue Cheer or MC5, or what they had was raw primal savagery. They found the animal. It was all through emotional intelligence. The MC5 were heavily into progressive jazz, and they incorporated all of that. And it was amazing because as we came to America, people like Rob Tina would start coming to our shows from the Five. So cool. We played his Wake as well. Yeah, there was so much information coming through, and I was trying to get in against the culture at the time because Even Robert Plant was quoted in one of the music papers saying, Asprey wears a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, now it's all of this. It exists somewhere, that quote.

[01:18:38.660] - Speaker 1
Actually, Robert brought me on stage when he did his solo tour in '89, Charlie was playing bass. And he said, I'm going to do a doors song. It was break on through. And he was a doors obsessive as well.

[01:18:51.270] - Speaker 2
Was he? I didn't know that.

[01:18:52.920] - Speaker 1
Well, he was actually regaled the story of being on a flight, Zeppelin on tour in America, and some dude up the front making a bit of always a bit of a racket. It was Morrison. Amazing. Led Zepman and the doors on the same flight. Incredible. It happened, kids. I'd love to see that.

[01:19:10.410] - Speaker 2
Me too.

[01:19:11.200] - Speaker 1
I would have loved to have been on that flight. But think about it. That's Robert Plant as a young man, as a human, flesh and bones, just like me and you, that was his path. Same as Jim Morrison, same as Bowie, same as all of them, same as all the greats, Miles Davis, Nina Simone, human beings. Letting it come through them. Some had teaching, some had technical abilities, others did not. They just did it intuitively. I guess environment played into a lot of it as well. Some of them dreamt about it and it happened. They wanted to be successful entertainers, whatever. Because I've never considered since day one ever being an entertainer. Something It's a different thing. It's a way different thing. Ride the Lightning. Yeah. Dianysis.

[01:20:05.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:20:06.320] - Speaker 1
All of that. Yes, I actually believe in it. But it's not for younger viewers. That's why the graveyards are full of early ones that burn out so young.

[01:20:18.870] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's dangerous work.

[01:20:20.340] - Speaker 1
It's dangerous work. If you stand close to the lightning, you're going to get hit. And believe me, I've been hit many times. It's a miracle I'm sitting here with you. It's actually perfect sitting with you talking about these things.

[01:20:33.520] - Speaker 2
How do you think the different art forms influence music, whether it be film, books, painting?

[01:20:42.080] - Speaker 1
This is my favorite. It's all interconnected. Everything is connected. That's my drug of choice, art. Special visual art. You've got two hours before a show in Madrid, where we're going, Rene Sofia, Guernica, bang, plugged in.

[01:21:00.200] - Speaker 2
Whoa.

[01:21:01.780] - Speaker 1
Or the black painting's Goyat Prado, hit it. Velazquez, bang. Just sucking it in. Rothko, first time I saw a real Rothko, I was wept. It ripped through me. That guy, when he killed himself, he didn't just commit suicide. He slashed himself to the bone. Wow. It's in the work.

[01:21:30.280] - Speaker 2
Look, you see the paintings get darker and darker and darker.

[01:21:33.760] - Speaker 1
And he was part of the pogroms, and they left Russia. He came to Portland, Oregon. When it was all the anti-Semitic stuff happening in the Russian Revolution, the family moved to Portland, and that was part of the rectangles in the painting with the graves that were dug. You think about the process to get to that because you look at some of his figurative stuff before that, and then he started flipping to colors and visceral elements of color, how color can impact the emotional field. Wow. How he arrived at that through his own process, internal process. He's one of probably the biggest gifts that we've ever had in the 20th century. Rothko. Van Gogh, of course. You know Van Gogh's paint, Story Story Nights in the Asylum with no windows?

[01:22:24.680] - Speaker 2
I didn't know that.

[01:22:26.320] - Speaker 1
There was no windows in the room when he painted that. It was in his head. St staggering. How is that possible? I just think of Alice in Wonderland. Drink this, taste that, do this. Don't open that door. Don't look at this note. Of course we do. And then we find out. Curiosity kills a cat. It's the Buddha field. Art, film, impacts. If you're open to it, like I saw Apocalypse Now when it came out, had a bottle of wine. And when the end came on, transformative.

[01:23:03.800] - Speaker 2
It's like it was written for that movie. It's what it felt like in the movie.

[01:23:07.550] - Speaker 1
It felt like it was written for me in that moment in my life. It was an awakening. The technicolor. Now to see Coppola talk about cinema now after he's made Macraopolis, wow, he's scorching what he's saying as an elder. And this is something with the culture that we, maybe as elders, It's like, we're not just saying this because we're elders. We're saying this because lived experience, there is value in it. Let's flip the telescope around the right way. There's a lot of information in lived experience, elder creatives.

[01:23:45.820] - Speaker 2
I'd say the most. Although I would say the wisdom of lived experience and the energy, the naive energy of not knowing anything, that's where all the juice is.

[01:24:01.920] - Speaker 1
That's when they collide is very, very powerful. Consider it now, crossing the threshold of 60. Consider that and how that time is limited. From a Buddhist perspective, we know that we have limited time. We don't know what the time of death is going to be or when we drop our bodies. So make every moment count. When you're young, you don't have that. You don't have in your pocket.

[01:24:30.800] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:24:31.780] - Speaker 1
So it's where you look at the elders and you go like, How did Roth code arrive at that? In permanence, he was accelerating the process. Mclaren was accelerating the process. Lennon, whomever, all accelerating the processes. Even Dave Gilmore has come out recently said, I've changing direction at 76 or whatever. It's like, oh, great. Phenomenal. Can we change direction, too? Absolutely. Sure you can. Do whatever you want.

[01:25:01.120] - Speaker 2
Whatever you want.

[01:25:02.220] - Speaker 1
Right now, I'm obsessed with Grand Parsons, Flying Burrito. You may be sweet and nice. We don't keep you warm at night because I'm the one let you in. That song destroys me. Correct. Destroys me. Or his version of Wild Horses. Him and Emily Harris. All of that. But then I can flip over to The Darkwave, Berlin, UFO 361, The Transgressive, Ethel Can, even parts of Vultures, stars. That night I'm playing in the stars, hold on. It's so desperate. We live in desperate times. So be a channel, stay open, get grounded. Gurus is just a word. The access points. Take what you need, leave the rest behind.

[01:26:04.040] - Speaker 2
Tell me about your spiritual life.

[01:26:05.880] - Speaker 1
My spiritual life. Well, first of all, I don't distinguish that as something separate. I was blessed. My grandmother was in a spiritualist Church on my father's side. The witchcraft laws were not repelled in Britain until 1951. 1951? It's not that long ago, really. No. So a lot of this nature-based West traditional path was suppressed, that energy. And just as rock and roll was coming in, the witchcraft laws were repelled, and now you could practice openly the new spiritual forms. Plus, we had people like Alan Watts. The East was coming in, the Oriental teachings were coming in, and they crept in through when the Portuguese were going to the Far East, and they weren't just bringing back silk, they were bringing back Buddhism. The British going to India, bringing back Escheria and it creeping into French symbolism and Nietzsche and all of it.

[01:27:07.740] - Speaker 2
But also having the Scottish root, that has a wild, mystical tradition.

[01:27:13.100] - Speaker 1
It does. It's deep. Yeah, deep Deep, deep, deep. When we were kids, we used to go on the weekends, you go up to the Highlands, you go to the locks and you'd be standing in nature and forests. I remember walking through a forest as a child.

[01:27:27.220] - Speaker 2
Would you hear stories of ferries and elves or entities.

[01:27:33.500] - Speaker 1
Entities. I mean, they pop up. When I was a child, I always, always believed it was little people lived in the kindergarten. They visit me in my dreams. As I get older, I go like, oh, yeah, they were there. That is definitely extraterrestral. It's terrestrial. It's just your psyche is able to go there.

[01:27:53.520] - Speaker 2
You're open enough to be able to see it.

[01:27:55.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah. As one of my best friends ever said, your ego is not your amigo. Let it go. It's a great line. Let go, let God. Let it come in. So all of that, the Buddha field, you go to Tibet, you see that, and they're just like, it's an everyday thing. Oh, yeah. Monks fly. There are NFTs. And by the way, there is the Yeti. Be careful on the trail.

[01:28:21.080] - Speaker 2
Do you ever have a mystical experience? Always.

[01:28:24.880] - Speaker 1
Sitting here with you is a mystical experience in this garden. You're kidding? But we are. Shangri-la, the lost seat of Tibet. It was so enlightened. It just went into the ether.

[01:28:36.460] - Speaker 2
Tell me something you believe now that you didn't believe when you were young.

[01:28:41.620] - Speaker 1
Oh, something I believe now that I didn't believe when I was young would be... When I was young, that's not possible.

[01:28:52.900] - Speaker 2
You believe some things were impossible when you were young. That's how you reach. And now, anything's possible.

[01:28:59.620] - Speaker 1
Anything Everything's possible. And that became more reinforced with each decade that I lived through to the point where you look at the calendar and you go like, wait a minute. Christmas is coming. I better get busy. That thing. I don't think I'm going to win the men's singles at Wimbledon. I might take that one-off or play for my favorite soccer team, whatever. But in terms of creativity, It's all possible. I've done many collaborations. I had the opportunity to perform with Raymond Zerick and Robbie Krieger. I got to do that in music. So incredible. The film, I've written synopsises. I'm now looking at having conversations with people about potentially making films, being in films, making art. I've always made art since I was a kid. I've got stashed away is the Ian that nobody's really seen because the Ian that nobody's really seen has been guarded by the dragon of it's not possible. And that dragon I've been fighting with for decades. Now, auspiciously, being back in your presence, you're like the guy going, Aha, I found the key long ago and I opened the door, and I went through it. And you can, too. And look, I even wrote a book about it.

[01:30:58.360] - Speaker 1
Did you read the book, by the way? I've been through the book. I've gone like, yeah, yeah, yeah. This hour I read your book. I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, It's a lot of yups. It's like, entry point, dog's point of forest. A good idea is when it happens. Okay. It's great. A good idea is when that happens. 5% inspiration, 95% perspiration. It's so good. It's like there's no avoiding the work.

[01:31:05.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's true.

[01:31:07.840] - Speaker 1
You may get hit by lightning a few times. Yes. And by the way, a stylist and your team of 30 writers and producers, someday they're not going to be around your ass. You have to do this yourself. So it depends which way you want to go.

[01:31:25.320] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get into the '60s English folk scene at It'd be like Fairport Convention, Pentangle.

[01:31:34.820] - Speaker 1
I sniffed around it. I never dove in. I liked early Genesis, like when Peter Gabriel was in Genesis talking about, Can you tell me where my country lies? Said the unicorn to his true love's eyes. Talking about the melancholia of the romantic period ending. And we're now going into the void of the shadow. Wow. As a teenager, I was listening to that going like, Oh, the unicorns are dying. But I had a Mojo interview the other day. They were trying to get into my head about what they thought it was. And I said, No, let me correct you. What you're witnessing is a burning unicorn. You're witnessing trauma. You're witnessing an individual on fire. It's not entertainment. This This is who I am. No better than, no less than.

[01:32:33.340] - Speaker 2
It's real. Yes.

[01:32:35.100] - Speaker 1
And if you can get close to the third rail, I mean, there's things that eventually we'll share through some medium when it's appropriate.

[01:32:44.440] - Speaker 2
Yeah, but it's not show biz.

[01:32:46.140] - Speaker 1
It ain't show business.

[01:32:48.120] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:32:48.600] - Speaker 1
Bill Graham told me that. Bill Graham was an incredible mentor to me. That's where we did Gathering of the Tribes. But it was very quickly taken into show business. And then Pepsi got all of it and did Woodstock and very Very quickly, the tail wag the dog, which is one of my favorite analogies right now. I'm always saying that every day. So we can't let the tail wag the dog.

[01:33:06.690] - Speaker 2
Because it keeps happening.

[01:33:07.680] - Speaker 1
We can't let the tail wag the dog. They're going, But look at this. It's got so much money and power. And I said, Yes, but it's a false economy. But we can have esoteric capitalism. There's nothing wrong with building wealth, material wealth. If you put a seed back in the ground. The bands that we've had opening for us, like the last I'm curating, I find, we just had a man call patriarchy open for us, this couple. They're incredible.

[01:33:36.920] - Speaker 2
It's amazing that you got to do this over the course of your life and you show up and you go up on stage and you do what you do. For all of us, that we get to have these incredible lives based on putting ourselves into this thing that we love, it's really a miracle. The whole thing's a miracle.

[01:33:58.180] - Speaker 1
It is a miracle. We live in these times. These are times we live in. We live down the road from JPL. We live in the seat of Escheria in the West. This area where I live, are Nosviles. There's a Gdampa Buddhist temple, Dominican Buddhist temple, five minutes from my house. Amazing. The oldest ashram in America, where Christopher Ishwood went, who wrote I am a camera that influenced Bowie, that's why he went to Berlin. He translated the bag of a gita into English. That's his ashram. He was friends with Aldous Huxley, who lived up the street as well. Theosophy, synagogs, Scientologists, which was connected to JPL through Jack Parsons, and all the esoteria is right there. And you think about Laurel Canyon.

[01:34:41.740] - Speaker 2
And Manly P. Hall is right there as well.

[01:34:43.780] - Speaker 1
Manly P. Hall is right there. Prs. We live right in it. I don't think I can live anywhere else. I'm not ready for Shangri-La just yet. This part of me is like, This is amazing. I would love to be in Shangri-La, but I know that couldn't stay.
