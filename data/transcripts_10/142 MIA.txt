[00:00:30.000] - Speaker 1
I was on this island, and I had not much of a direction, but I was going to be a painter. I studied at Saint Martens, and I was really into art and film, but not music, really. But I was into music, but it was- That was not going to be your path.

[00:00:42.370] - Speaker 2
Exactly. You love music, but you were going to be an artist.

[00:00:45.260] - Speaker 1
Yes. I was 100% music fan. I knew all of my beats, all of my stuff, all of my artists. Even before I was a teenager, I would trek halfway across London to find the right 12-inch. I was obsessed. Even Even in London, when I would hang out or bunker school and explore London, I would be drawn to meeting friends based on their music taste. Obviously, most teenagers are. But I would hear people play music out their window, and I would literally knock on their door and be like, Hey, I want to be your friend. Because there was no phones, cell phones, or there's no other way of finding people. People back then. So you would just walk down the street. And if you knew that song is a banging song-If they're listening to that, that's someone I want to talk to. Exactly. And if you met people on the underground tubes and they were wearing a T-shirt that said a certain song, and you're like, Okay, that's my best friend. It was just like that. So I realized that all of my life, everyone I had around was met through this musical thing. But I never wanted to be a musician.

[00:02:00.260] - Speaker 1
But my musical friend who was in a band called Elastica, she wanted to go somewhere. I had this painting exhibition, and it did really well. It was my first break.

[00:02:15.680] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the paintings.

[00:02:19.160] - Speaker 1
I went to make a documentary film about the war in Sri Lanka. Then when I came back to make the film for channel 4, I I don't know. It just fell through because the person who was helping me commission it at channel 4, he was the head of documentaries. I felt like I got in the way of this serious subject. So everyone would be like, Why do you want to talk about this? Because this is so heavy, but you seem not like that person.

[00:02:59.240] - Speaker 2
You're I'm from there, no?

[00:03:01.140] - Speaker 1
Yes, I'm from there. But because I went to art school and I was cool, and people felt documentarians are quite boring and serious people. And so he asked me out on a date, and I felt really, I don't know, disappointed or let down by that. So I didn't want to carry on making this film. And so I thought, I just stay at home and convert these stills into paintings. So that was my first thing, to be reclusive and to do something where you're just self-reliant, don't need money. It was the cheapest thing I could do. And generated these paintings. And my friend was like, Oh, you can show them in my space. Showed them. Then things happened pretty quickly. Got picked up for this alternate paternity Prize. And people was like, Yeah, we have a painter. Another person's arrived in the art scene. I was like, Yeah, all in. This is what I'm going to do. And then My singer friend was having some health issues, and she was like, I need to take this time out. And since you're my best friend, you should come and be with me. I was like, okay. But I was crying because I was like, wow, it took so long to get this break.

[00:04:31.220] - Speaker 1
And you're asking me at the cusp of this thing, and it's going to change everything because I've never been on holiday up to that point. And I was like, the last thing I want to do is sit somewhere with you where nothing's going on. I would go mad. And I have to work off the momentum of the paintings doing well and keep working on it. And she was like, no, you have to do this for me. And so I made a decision to go, and it turned out to be the best thing ever.

[00:05:04.060] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that. Where did you go and what happened?

[00:05:06.860] - Speaker 1
We went to a little island called Betcway, and it's in Saint Vincent. And when we arrived, musically, it was amazing because everyone had sound systems everywhere in the street, and it played music all the time. Even when you sleep at 3: 00 in the morning, it's on. 6: 00 in the morning, it's on. It's just constant. I was just sleeping to bass lines, waking up to bass lines. Everything had a bass line in the background. There was just not a quiet moment. And I thought, Oh, this is not so bad because I know all of these songs because the Jamaican scene in London was huge. And so suddenly, I was like, Oh, my God, this is all the songs I grew up on. And to experience it in that environment was amazing. And I was out dancing in the street because there was no clubs. They just had a shack in the street. And it was all hilly so the parents can see everything that was happening. One of them came up to me and said, We see you dancing every night in the street. Why don't you go to church on Sunday? And I was like, Okay.

[00:06:24.280] - Speaker 1
So I went. So I think we partied Monday to Saturday. And then Sunday, I went to church. And then when I was in church, I was clapping all crazy. And they stopped the service and they came up and they said, We've seen you dancing. All of a sudden, your rhythm has disappeared for Jesus. What happened to you? And I was like, You're right. It's weird. I just can't do this. And so that day, because this lady asked me that, I went home and I'm like, I'm going to figure it out. What is wrong with me just doing this normal clap? And I realized that I was just clapping out this entire new beat on top of the vocals.

[00:07:11.560] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:07:13.020] - Speaker 1
And I was like, oh, that's really weird because when I'm dancing, it comes out different in my body. But when I have to isolate it to just my hands and follow some beat, I just cannot do it.

[00:07:25.110] - Speaker 2
It's like you're playing a counter rhythm.

[00:07:26.980] - Speaker 1
Yes. I was filling in all the blanks and stuff. I see. Then that day we wrote the galang beat. It was really restraining yourself and converting it into a machine that made some pattern of the thing your body wanted to do. And then it all just clicked. And then my friend came home and she listened to it and she was like, Wow, you might be a songwriter. She was I think you can do this. And really, I was like, I want to write stuff so you have a new record to make. And then I'm going to go back to my painting. Ten days from now, I'm going to write you an album, and then I'm going to go back to my painting, and you're going to do music and not get bored. And that was really the deal. And as we started writing more and more, it started to emerge that it was actually its own thing. And then that was it. When I came back to London, I locked myself in the room, just stopped all of my socializing.

[00:08:39.800] - Speaker 2
Stopped painting as well?

[00:08:41.260] - Speaker 1
Stopped painting. Stopped everything. And for three months, I just sat in this room and learned my voice.

[00:08:49.840] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the process. How do you do that?

[00:08:53.020] - Speaker 1
Well, it was just that I'd never heard my voice through a microphone. I had this tape there, Kufuhr track, and this 100-pound mic. And it was just making these sounds and going like, that's my voice. That's crazy. And then just becoming comfortable and then having fun with it And then just letting that be the thing. So not trying to copy someone else, not trying to put pressure to be good and great or anything. Really just speaking and then And learning how it sounded loud and how it sounded quiet, how it sounded when you whisper. And just being mind blown by it and just like, well, you can make it do anything. And just learning the voice as an instrument. And then the beat making bit became secondary. And I was like, okay, so the documentary went into being the paintings, but maybe I can make those turn into songs. Yeah. And so the paintings were of a revolutionary vibes because it was content that was shot.

[00:10:10.160] - Speaker 2
In all of the different modalities, the content was the same.

[00:10:14.080] - Speaker 1
It was the same.

[00:10:15.140] - Speaker 2
It was always telling this story about a revolutionary period.

[00:10:19.320] - Speaker 1
Yes. It was also revolutionary in that it was being made with no money and no rules. In terms of the industry, it was like, I just need to hear someone that tells me some information that I don't know. I wasn't sometimes getting that in the songs. But say the '90s, hip hop gave you stuff. You were like, Okay, I just studied the whole thing when you hear a song. But we were in 2002, 2003, where it was much more like manufactured pop music. You had Simon Cowell churning out bands. It was that era of everything being super shiny. But we were at war in Afghanistan. The Tamals were still at war. You had artists like Banksi that was coming from my neighborhood who always wanted to mess with the status quo. Coming from the art scene, you had to be like that. As a musician, it was like, Okay, if I'm not going to be Banksi, then it just naturally became the Banksi version of the music. It was about saying, Okay, we don't have the certain luxuries to talk about certain things. There are great things, and I'd like to talk about love and all this beautiful stuff, but right now, I don't have the luxury to do that.

[00:12:00.000] - Speaker 1
It's something you have to work at, but you have to start where you start and report on the social situation that you're in. I just wrote things that were also quite personal because I knew also that you were going to be criticized, and so it had to be really personal. And if it's coming from truth, no one can knock it. No matter what anyone says.

[00:12:31.490] - Speaker 2
You're sharing your experience. No one can comment on your diary being good or bad. It's your experience.

[00:12:38.820] - Speaker 1
And also, if it's true, you don't know any other way. It's better to never second guess what other people are going to like and do exactly what you feel in the purest form, because at least you know you are true to yourself in that moment. And you can evolve and you can change and you can revisit your ideas In that moment, if it was coming from a true place, there's nothing to criticize. So I was already aware of that. So I always kept it very like, that's the most important thing.

[00:13:12.960] - Speaker 2
In the time that you were finding your voice, was it only the sound of the instrument or was it also the words?

[00:13:22.500] - Speaker 1
The words, it just comes naturally. I was good at it Because I wanted to be a filmmaker, so I wrote quite a lot. But I always fell asleep with my four track on one side and my notebook on the other side. So you wake up and you just write down what comes to you. If I thought about a beat and I fell asleep, it would just tell me what I need to say thing. Then you wake up. So I often worked out of my bed because that's just how far the spear was.

[00:14:05.120] - Speaker 2
It's probably the closest place to your subconscious. You're tapping into that part of yourself that you reach through dreams.

[00:14:13.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Your bed is like an altar as well. If her beat is good, you can't get it out of your head. Then when you go to sleep and it's in your head, naturally, your subconscious is working out the tune and the beat and what you would say. Then you're like, if you fight that and you ignore it and you get up and you start doing other things, I feel like sometimes there's layers. It can still live with it. Then you walk by someone and they would say a word, and then it would trigger it again. And you're like, Oh, yeah, I got to go and write that down. And at that time, I heard that M&M. He always had a notebook or something. I remember thinking, I was like that. I was writing on bus tickets. And when you have it, you got to write it down. And that if you forget it, you might not come back. So I was always just like, write everywhere. And it was just all the time. That's everything I'm writing on it. So, yeah, the words were coming, but it wasn't serious. It was just entertaining myself is what I thought.

[00:15:25.780] - Speaker 2
Would you say you were learning the language of music?

[00:15:28.920] - Speaker 1
I was definitely going Okay, as a filmmaker, everyone taught me to write these long things that last an hour. And then as a musician, you have to squash it into three minutes. And so you're like, how do you tell a story in three minutes? So that was the only process where you're like, Okay, you have to edit, edit, edit, edit, edit that I was learning and I really enjoyed doing. But 10 years into it, it became like a rut. You could get stuck in that, and suddenly it's very difficult to break out of that.

[00:16:15.380] - Speaker 2
What was the first thing that you put out into the world musically?

[00:16:19.820] - Speaker 1
So Galang was the first song we wrote, and the demo tape, I decided when we got back to London that it was still not me as an artist. That I was like, now I have to scout girls to sing this. I'm going to be Simon Cowell. So I scouted these three girls to be MIA. That's interesting. Yes. Our first recording of Galang was me demoing to them how the vocal should be and then them replacing that vocal. So EMI at the time, they had Justine's band Elastica. And so she managed to wing me some studio time. It was like £150 worth. That's how much I earned per week when I went to this shop. So I was like, Okay, I can afford that. And we went and recorded Glang. So first there was a version with my vocal, and then there was a version with the girls singing.

[00:17:20.740] - Speaker 2
The professional singers.

[00:17:22.220] - Speaker 1
The professional singers, exactly. And then people started hearing my version and saying, Oh, this is much more interesting. You should sing it. And so the original Galang, which is the Galang that's on the album, is the original demo of me vocaling for the girls. So it's not even with the intention like, This is me and I've arrived. It's like, It's something like this, and you guys do the real thing. And that's the first song. And we put out 500 white labels, and then it got picked up on Radio One as the record of the week. And I was working in the shop, and I was having to do phone radio interviews. Yeah, it was crazy. And then Excel happened to be... So my house was there. The shop I worked at was there, and Excel was the next- All three right in a row. Yeah, it was like a block there, block there, and a block there. So it really was quite effortless.

[00:18:32.500] - Speaker 2
But you didn't move there to be close to Excel. It just was like that.

[00:18:36.300] - Speaker 1
It just happened to be there. The shop I was working at, there was a boys shop across the street called Supra, and all the boys hung out there. A friend of mine was working there, and he said, Oh, this guy came in, and he says he's from this record label called XL, and he's interested in meeting you. And maybe you should go and find him. And that's when I found the address, and it is on the next block. So I just, in my lunchtime, walked over there and knocked on the door, and I was like, I think you're looking for me. And it's in the documentary where nick Hugget is like, She came in and she said, Oh, you're looking for me. I did. I was like, I think you're looking for me because that's what I heard.

[00:19:19.940] - Speaker 2
That's what you heard. Then I played the land. Nick Hugget was the person you played it for?

[00:19:23.360] - Speaker 1
Yes. Nick Hugget also signed Dizzy Rascal. Yeah. And Adele. And Adele. And so he was famous because he'd signed Dizy. It hasn't happened yet. And so, yeah, nick signed me, and then the rest is history. Yeah.

[00:19:45.000] - Speaker 2
See if I had my phone, it'd be nice if we listened to that first song.

[00:19:48.480] - Speaker 1
Yeah, the beat is... Everyone involved, it's their first time making something like that. So Ross from the Fat Truckers, their music is not like that. But he was doing something new, and Steve Maki comes from Pulp, and he makes indie music.

[00:20:11.120] - Speaker 2
You want to play it?

[00:20:15.000] - Speaker 1
Lining coolings beat the slang now, boys say what? One girl say what? What? Lining coolings beat the slang now, boys say what? One girl say what? What? Slam. Get down, get down, get down, get down. Get, get, get down, get down. Too late, you down. Get, get, get, get, get,

[00:21:15.000] - Speaker 1
Two bullish things on the hook, one paramour, two blaze and you still be fit. Play the bass, go langa langa langa. Play the bass, go langa langa langna. Play the bass, go langa langa langna. Purple bass, go langa langa langna. Lining goalings, beat this langna. Boys say, what? One, girls say, what? What? Lining goalings, beat this langna. Boys say, what? One, girls say, what? What, face, hey. Fever's going to run through, work is going to save you. Prying you in the face, something that can help you. Don't let them get to (Lang, lang, lang, lang, lang, baby, lank, lang, lang, lang, lang,

[00:23:40.040] - Speaker 1
Do you remember how you made the beat? Yeah, it's on the 505. Roland 505. So Peaches had that. So she's the one who introduced me and Justine to this machine. And Justine was playing the guitar, and she'd never had a beat machine before. And so Peaches would try to teach me it. And we made this beat. And like I said, I had the demo, and then we were like, But we need somebody to take it off our machines. And so we paired up with Ross from Pat Truckers, who then added the moog bass line. And yeah, the 505 bought all the other binge bongy sounds. But at the time, the dance floor scene was the most progressive in beat making at the time. And they were all so very stripped down. And it was like, wow, they're just making beats from space. They just did not care. And I just loved that. But we were like, Oh, one day we're going to get to making these beats. But we were doing weird electronic avant-garde stuff because we were just like, Oh, girls messing around on this thing. It was like a mashup of everything, and people were like, Wow, what is this thing?

[00:25:07.760] - Speaker 2
I imagine this sounded really foreign compared to everything else that was playing at the time.

[00:25:13.870] - Speaker 1
Everyone's like, What is this? What is this? Then also your vocals, because it's so nonchalant. It was nonchalant because it was just a demo. People thought, Okay, that's her.

[00:25:26.500] - Speaker 2
You were demonstrating how it went. You weren't singing the song.

[00:25:29.300] - Speaker 1
No, I wasn't. They were like, What is this? Who is that? Then a couple of months later, I heard there was this DJ called Diplo coming into town. I heard one of his songs, his first demo. I was like, Oh, that guy gets it. I was like, He knows beats. I was like a beat junkie. I really knew my stuff. I like really hard beats, so I needed somebody who understood that. And even though he was making quite like trip hop stuff, he also knew the danceful stuff and the Brazilian stuff. The Variations in Hip hop. And that was the first time I took it to a club and was like, Can you play this record? So I met him and I gave him Sunshows and Galang. Then we made the Piracy Funds Terrorism mixtape a few months after that. So that all added to the momentum that it was going to stay weird, that there was something else happening because it became like a movement. And for the first time, you would go to one of our club shows and you had kids from everywhere, like the indie kids and the punk kids. You had the clash reference in that slang song, which is weird.

[00:27:00.000] - Speaker 1
Because in hindsight, I'm like, wow, that's mad because I was into the clash and the clash were living in West London, so their presence was around. But the clash come from the area in London where My family lived in the '70s when me and my sister were born. So we come from Wandsworth, and they also come from Wandsworth. And it's weird because my family's story is the clash. We were clashing the government for 35 years or something.

[00:27:29.560] - Speaker 2
Tell me What's the story.

[00:27:31.480] - Speaker 1
Well, so when I was born in Wandsworth, I think Clash did their first show. It was actually outside like Sex Pistols and The Clash. They were all performing in Clapham Junction, which is Wandsworth. And then my dad has got the craziest stories. So he was not into politics at all. As a 16-year-old, he got a scholarship to Russia because he was the smartest kid in Sri Lanka. And they put him on the first commercial flight from Sri Lanka to Moscow, which the Yuri Gagarin came from space and decided that was his life mission to go around the world and preach world peace. And the first place he went to was Sri Lanka. And when he went there, he decided to launch a scientific program to industrialize Sri Lanka. So they set up a program where they were like, We're going to scout the smartest kids, and we're to go and teach them science. And my dad got chosen. And when my dad passed the exam, he thought he's going to Paris. But it was a Russian University called Patrice, and he read it wrong. He was on a plane to Moscow, completely thinking he was going to France.

[00:28:54.400] - Speaker 1
So he lands in the snow and with flip flops on, has a massive cultural shock at 16.

[00:29:03.430] - Speaker 2
He was 16, you bet.

[00:29:04.400] - Speaker 1
He was 16. And he came from a mud hub. It's not even a town with a concrete house. He came from a farm. So he went there and he was a bit of a math genius, and he was doing space design, and machine design, and all of that. And then his professor happened to be this guy who was quite clashy, and he supported a freedom fighter, and he got exiled by the Russian government. So he got fired from the university, and he had to go and live two hours out of Moscow. And my dad said, If I don't visit him every weekend, they're just going to kill him because that's what they do. They isolate you. And then once you have no friends, they'll just silently kill you. So my dad was like, I made it a point to go and visit my professor every weekend and make him food and hang out with him. The equivalent of what he did was if you put your name on a petition to free Julian Assange, and the professor did something like that. The Russian government had imprisoned a guy who stood up for something, and he signed a petition saying he should be released, and that's why he lost his job.

[00:30:25.320] - Speaker 2
He called out an injustice and was prosecuted.

[00:30:27.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. And up to this point, my dad He's completely clueless. He's just studying design.

[00:30:32.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and he's a kid. He's 16. He's a kid.

[00:30:35.260] - Speaker 1
He starts going around to the professor's house, and the professor happened to be an expert in Tamil language.

[00:30:44.720] - Speaker 2
What are the odds?

[00:30:45.700] - Speaker 1
What are the odds? So he had this incredible library of all of the ancient Tamil texts. So my dad really studied Tamil through a Russian Jewish professor who was exiled every weekend. He started learning these books and the context, even like Bahava Gita and all the religious texts. It's really specific stuff.

[00:31:13.270] - Speaker 2
It's an incredible story.

[00:31:14.460] - Speaker 1
Yeah, That's crazy. And so that's how my dad got injected a tiny bit of nationalism. So he studied this, and he was like, Wow, this is actually a really old culture, and it's really traditional and important, and the language.

[00:31:32.980] - Speaker 2
In Sri Lanka, he didn't know the history.

[00:31:35.540] - Speaker 1
No. My grandpa was a headmaster, but they were a Catholic family. So he never studied religious Hindu texts, and he's never been introduced to that. The family had been Catholic for a long time. So my dad went and learned all of it.

[00:31:53.740] - Speaker 2
How long was he in Russia for?

[00:31:56.400] - Speaker 1
He was there for about four or five years. So, yeah, he left when he was like, 21, 22. So he was learning all this stuff. And this is what happened. The professor started converting the Tamil liberal ideas, like Hindu texts into Russian and then selling these books. So they started making loads of money, and they would sell 5,000 copies every weekend. And the Russian kids in the '60s, they were like, Oh, my God, what is this shit? They'd never been introduced to anything liberal.

[00:32:32.820] - Speaker 2
The same thing was happening all over the world. These ancient texts in San Francisco, for example, it was the time for these old ideas to come back. That's what happened in the '60s.

[00:32:46.440] - Speaker 1
Something happened. Yeah, all over the world. All over the world, yeah. What my dad was saying is that in the '60s, Che Guebara would come to Moscow to do lectures. My dad, he would listen to everybody But at the same time, the Russians always thought, It's the Americans that are corrupting these kids with these liberal ideas. Where is this coming from? So they started looking for who's doing this. They knew it was my dad's professor who had these books. And then the professor hired my dad.

[00:33:17.980] - Speaker 2
It's funny calling them liberal ideas because they're ancient ideas. They're not- They are. He wasn't teaching something new. He was teaching something old.

[00:33:25.570] - Speaker 1
Yes. But they were considered... It was unwiring the fabric of what was happening at the time. And they were like, We have to eradicate anyone who's bringing anything new.

[00:33:37.940] - Speaker 2
At that point in time, was religion illegal in Russia?

[00:33:44.360] - Speaker 1
I don't know. The '60s going on to '65 to '70, we're talking about, specifically. It may be because my dad also went to Italy, and he smuggled the Catholic Bible and stuff into Russia. He said he had to do it with those spy movies where they have to take photos. He was like, I had to take pictures of all 600 pages, hide it in stuff, and smuggle it into Russia. And that was just a Catholic Bible. I didn't even think that that was... But even you couldn't go get to the Orthodox.

[00:34:21.760] - Speaker 2
But again, it's ancient. It's ancient ideas. It wasn't these new, crazy new ideas.

[00:34:28.960] - Speaker 1
It's mad because Because then my dad, actually at the age of 21, smuggled the professor and the whole family because of all of this stuff. And it's to do with books and knowledge as well. It's not like my dad was doing anything crazy.

[00:34:44.980] - Speaker 2
No, just preserving knowledge. Yes.

[00:34:46.610] - Speaker 1
It was just so knowledge-based.

[00:34:49.000] - Speaker 2
How did he get them out? Where did he take them to?

[00:34:51.690] - Speaker 1
Because my dad's Catholic, when he went to Italy, to the place, the cathedral, and to the places to get the copies of the Bible, he knew a Sri Lankan nun who'd known him ages before. They provided a temporary housing for his professors Family. So my dad negotiated this at 21. Then went back to Russia, smuggled them all out, and then he left them in the monastery with this woman being the point of contact where he was writing letters and making sure everyone was all right. At the time, I found out my dad was actually in love with the professor's daughter, and that's why he was inspired to do all this crazy stuff he's doing, because I was like, That's a lot. So he flew to London, and he's like, I'm going to wait here until their visa gets approved to come to London. So he left them in Italy, came to London. At 21, he didn't know anyone in London, but he's working in London now in a factory. He's doing night shifts to earn money to feed this family.

[00:36:04.540] - Speaker 2
You know how he chose to go to London?

[00:36:06.560] - Speaker 1
I guess it's because it's an English-speaking country, and he had this engineering degree, and it was like, Oh, yeah, you can get a job at an airplane factory. I guess they had that manufacturing capabilities at the time and needed engineers and stuff, and he was going there. But he thought that they were going to be there in a month or something. But he said it turned a month into two, and then it just went on and on. And in the end, the British didn't give them the visa, but America did. And so that family left to America. And my dad was heartbroken and was stuck in London for no reason. And fast forward to Clapham Junction, outside the clash in the Sex Pistols gig, he's in a pub, and he's drowning his sorrows. Because the girlfriend's left and said, See you later. And he was depressed and had no money to go back to Russia because he sent it all to this family all the time. And he was sharing bedside with some other Tamils he'd met. And in walks my uncle, which is my mom's brother. And he had a fashion business. And he was like, I'm looking for somebody to marry my sister.

[00:37:32.580] - Speaker 1
And my dad needed money.

[00:37:35.420] - Speaker 2
He was looking for someone to marry his sister for what reason?

[00:37:38.880] - Speaker 1
Because my mom was on a student visa. I see. And it was running out in a week's time. And he was like, I need somebody with a visa. For some reason, my dad had a longer visa. Yeah.

[00:37:50.760] - Speaker 2
If they got married, they'd be able to both stay?

[00:37:53.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah. My dad was like, I need the money. My mom's like, I need the visa. And they got married three days after.

[00:38:02.640] - Speaker 2
How long were they together for?

[00:38:04.060] - Speaker 1
They were together until the war intensified and my dad had to leave. So they had me and my sister in London in that same situation. So this is what happened. He wasn't political. But when they moved into a bed, sit together on the day of the wedding, they accidentally moved into a house of a guy who was political. So he was like a Tamil guy who took them in. And he was like, Hey, for two years, I've been trying to start a revolution. And every time I scout guys, they just keep running off.

[00:38:42.810] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the purpose of the revolution What was the situation going on in Sri Lanka?

[00:38:48.220] - Speaker 1
So at the time, they were needing to have a revolution.

[00:38:53.000] - Speaker 2
I don't know what that means needing to have a revolution.

[00:38:55.200] - Speaker 1
So the British left Sri Lanka, and they gave the independence back to Sri Lanka. America. But the whole time the British was there, they educated the Tamils as the middle classes, and they kept the Singles, which were the majority, as the working class. So the Tamil people, even though we were the minority, we had all the best jobs in the government. So they were the civil servant.

[00:39:20.420] - Speaker 2
How long was the British rule?

[00:39:22.780] - Speaker 1
From the 1800s.

[00:39:24.640] - Speaker 2
And everyone spoke English?

[00:39:27.140] - Speaker 1
Yes. That was like our national Our schooling system was like Cambridge, Oxford, Standard. There was always visas and travel between Sri Lanka. It was a Commonwealth country, which is also why my dad had the visa. And there was a protest. And my dad's dad, my grandpa, went to this protest outside the parliament, and he got beat up. And they threw him in the canal to die. And my grandpa found a A hole, the pipe in the canal. He swam through the pipe and he escaped. And he was in hospital, the dislocated shoulder, broken ribs and everything. And he wrote to my dad, and he's like, You need to come back here because the situation is bad and that we need people getting involved to speak to the government that this is not right. The protests are getting violent. We don't know what to do. Explain more about what was going on.

[00:40:31.120] - Speaker 2
So the English leave.

[00:40:32.800] - Speaker 1
The English left and they gave the power back to the Singles. And the Singles, overnight, decided to become quite totalitarian.

[00:40:41.890] - Speaker 2
I see. And they were a minority as well, you were saying.

[00:40:44.280] - Speaker 1
No, they were the majority. So they were the 75% population. Thomas were 25. And they said, Oh, it's our turn to get our backs on 100 year of you guys being protected by the British. So now we're going to like, nihilate you. And they came in and said, We're going to take away Tamil language as a national thing on street signs.

[00:41:09.880] - Speaker 2
You know if when the British left, if it was viewed as freeing, was that the perception was that now Sri Lanka is free.

[00:41:20.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because I guess we're the back garden of India, and Gandhi was such a big thing. Yeah. He's like, We're free, and India is free. And so Sri Lanka was just like, whoa, but we're a tiny island. Actually, I think Sri Lanka enjoyed having the British there.

[00:41:39.800] - Speaker 2
What you're describing it, it sounds like life was better when Britain was there.

[00:41:44.340] - Speaker 1
It was. Because when I hear my uncles talk about it, they'll be like, oh, it's so much better in the '60s. And also Sri Lanka was set to become the Singapore of Southeast Asia. And we had so much going just before the war started. But the war starts in a very unpletable way with a single thing. My dad, he really was thrown into it. He had this knowledge that he'd learned in Russia. So he actually became super useful because he had more knowledge They always invited him to write up the manifesto and do this and do that. My dad, his first approach was to write a book, and it was called Lankarani. Rani means queen, and Lankar, Sri Lanka. It was a boat. It was the exodus story of Tamils leaving Colombo in this exodus mission to go back to their homeland in the north because the government was getting rid of all the Tamils from the South. So on this boat ride, you had all of these characters that represented all of the political ideologies of the time discussing what the dream was, what utopia looked like.

[00:43:19.720] - Speaker 2
Did you say it was a philosophical book?

[00:43:21.700] - Speaker 1
I think so. But then it accidentally became the Manifesta for the Revolution because so many other revolutionaries at the time used that book as a thing to identify it.

[00:43:34.560] - Speaker 2
It was written metaphorically. It was written as a story. It wasn't written as a now go do this.

[00:43:40.040] - Speaker 1
No, it was a philosophical conversation. Same way, Bahava Gita is a conversation thing. It was just different ideologies talking. Because my dad also knew about the political situations around the world, so he could talk about what someone like Castro would do to what someone like the Russian government would do. He just put all of them in one boat and made them have a chat. A lot of people drew from that and was like, Okay, this is what we would do. Then from that, emerged four groups that wanted to fight. The groups were like, it's almost like represented a social run. The tigers represented the common poor people, and they were big in numbers. Then my dad had the elite, which was the intellectuals. They were smaller in number, but then much more like knowledgeable. Then the next 20 years became a battle between these four against the government and then these four against each other. That's the backdrop to the record. I'd lived there for 10 years until I was 10.

[00:44:58.870] - Speaker 2
During this That was in that time? Yeah.

[00:45:01.580] - Speaker 1
So the war, when I was born, within six months, my dad decided to go and join the revolution. So I was six months old, and we were on the farm, and there was loads of training and this and that.

[00:45:17.860] - Speaker 2
What do you remember about childhood?

[00:45:20.920] - Speaker 1
Childhood was not easy because pretty soon, my mom was like, What is this? I didn't sign up for this. She packed up took the kids and left. We lived in Jaffna town. The farm was in the middle of nowhere. She moved us to a town and put us in with her family. When we grew up, she had 13 brothers and sisters. It was a whole town.

[00:45:51.480] - Speaker 2
The whole town was your family?

[00:45:53.940] - Speaker 1
The whole town was my family. That was fun.

[00:45:57.400] - Speaker 2
Living in that town, were you aware of the war going on around you?

[00:46:00.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because we were outcasts.

[00:46:02.120] - Speaker 2
What is the experience of being an outcast?

[00:46:04.960] - Speaker 1
They would say, Oh, these kids. First of all, we didn't have a dad. That was like an unheard of thing. In the '70s in Sri Lanka, The only time you didn't have a dad is if he was dead. And then my mom raised us thinking my dad was my uncle. So sometimes when we saw him, we'd only see him once a year or something.

[00:46:27.200] - Speaker 2
Did you know he was your dad or no?

[00:46:28.800] - Speaker 1
No, we didn't know.

[00:46:30.000] - Speaker 2
Oh, I didn't know this. This is interesting. Because it was dangerous if he was your dad?

[00:46:35.940] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because the army would come to our village and arrest everyone. And then they would get us because everyone knew we were the kids. We didn't know, but they knew. And they would single my mom out and the kids. And they would put us on their lap and be like, Oh, tell me what your daddy got you. And they would trick us. And my mom always was like, You don't have a dad. If somebody says, Where's your dad? You just point to the sky. It was just so that we didn't answer the army by saying, Oh, my dad bought us an ice cream or something. But we would be like, What does dad mean? Because we genuinely didn't know. Also the village or the town would already be like, These kids don't have a dad. We were like, Oh, we just don't have him. We didn't know where he was. When they say, Where is he? We'd say, We don't know. I think he's in the sky. It's in the documentary where I do say to my dad, when I do first see him, I go, We didn't know you were our dad. And I was like, 19.

[00:47:43.520] - Speaker 2
When did you go to London?

[00:47:45.020] - Speaker 1
I was 10.

[00:47:46.100] - Speaker 2
How different was that experience?

[00:47:48.620] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah, it was huge. But I was really into music in Sri Lanka, and I was artistic, even in school. And I remember during the war, I said to my mom, I wanted to learn singing. And the war got so bad during the time I asked that the lady who did singing lessons, she also made bread. My mom was like, You can choose singing lessons or you could choose bread. You get one choice. Right now, the family needs bread, which I need a singer. And so I just never took up singing. But I was growing up and we had a television. So my fashion designer uncle from England, he bought the entire town one TV. He put it in our house. So once a month, the entire neighborhood would gather like 100 people in our living room and everyone was squash. He bought one fridge for the whole neighborhood, and we had one TV. We would collect a dollar each day. When we got $30 or something together, the town would go and rent a VCR. Then we would hire Tamil movies and watch them. But when we watched them, because we only had it for 24 hours, the VCR, we would hire 10 movies and watch them all in one go.

[00:49:25.760] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:49:26.680] - Speaker 1
People in the street would make ice cubes in the freezer because it was the first time they'd seen a freezer. We would use the ice cubes to put on our face to stay awake.

[00:49:38.840] - Speaker 2
Because it was hot or just- No, just to stay awake.

[00:49:41.340] - Speaker 1
No, just to stay awake so we can watch all of them before we have to hand it in. Consuming entertainment was this whole process, right?

[00:49:50.740] - Speaker 2
And your house was the local cinema?

[00:49:53.550] - Speaker 1
It was. And before the war, my grandpa actually owned a cinema. Yeah, my mom's dad. So the movie thing was a big deal. And I'd watch these movies, and the only songs we had available was the movie songs. So there was no music industry in India. There's none whatsoever. There's none in Sri Lanka.

[00:50:14.140] - Speaker 2
So it was a soundtrack songs.

[00:50:15.370] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So that is all you had to feed you for the whole year is whatever movie that came out. And so your input and the way you took it in and memorized it was so intense because that's the only chance he had. I would be so religiously locked in. The impact these songs had on me was huge because of that reason. It was so scarce. Also, we didn't move around the city and go and hang out in a mall. There was no such thing. It was a war zone, and people were getting shot all the time. So you didn't go out of the zone. People didn't enjoy themselves It was like, you didn't have music on all the time or did stuff. You didn't dress up because you don't want to attract attention. It was dangerous for the girls, dangerous for the boys. It was dangerous for everyone. So everyone just was trying to be muted. When you huddled together in this room to consume this stuff. It was just like transporting you into this other world. I wanted to learn music, and my mom was like, no. That's also a sign of the times when your music teacher has to also make bread on the side.

[00:51:34.900] - Speaker 1
A, to get money, but also just because the food became quite an issue. I think coming to England, it was the first time I'd seen music again. It was just a crash course in absorbing everything very quickly.

[00:51:56.980] - Speaker 2
Did you still feel that need to be muted, or did you feel like now you could be free?

[00:52:03.620] - Speaker 1
It was totally different. When I came to England, we had to live in a shared accommodation with some other family. So it was like 15 people in a house.

[00:52:14.450] - Speaker 2
All Sri Lankan?

[00:52:15.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So it was like all the family members that were in danger in the warzone, it left. And my fashion designer uncle had saved all these people, but he was just like, Now you got to do your own We were all living in this one house, and it belonged to my little cousin who was learning how to play the guitar at the time. We were like, What's that? Never seen a guitar before. He was super white. He was born and bred in England. He didn't speak Tamil when he was playing the guitar. His favorite thing were Beatle songs. We were like, Who is this kid? Everything we I learned was through him and what he was into.

[00:53:02.500] - Speaker 2
He was your age as well?

[00:53:03.980] - Speaker 1
He was a couple of years older than me, but he found us fascinating, but we had no way to communicate because we didn't know English.

[00:53:10.770] - Speaker 2
I see.

[00:53:11.280] - Speaker 1
He didn't know Tamil. He would just sing Beatles songs to us. We were learning English through his songs. He had 10 records, I think when Whitney Houston, Saving a My Love came out. That's when we arrived. That was the opening to the soundtrack of My Life in London was that record. Then he had all the Beatles records. He had Simon and the Garf Uncle, and then Evita. That's what I had. I had to learn those really intensely and learn English through these records.

[00:53:52.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah, fantastic.

[00:53:54.120] - Speaker 1
Then they put us in school after three, four months. All of my vocabulary came from that of songs. One day, we were in assembly, and they asked a question. I didn't understand it, but everyone put their hands up. It was like 500 kids in a school hall. I put mine up, too, because I was like, I guess you're supposed to put your hands up.

[00:54:18.360] - Speaker 2
This is what you're supposed to do.

[00:54:19.760] - Speaker 1
And they picked me, right? And it was basically a talent contest for them to choose. It was like the Amnesty International talent contest. And then the winner was going to win something. I don't know. But they were like, Yeah, come to the stage. I was just like, Oh, my God. This is not how it's supposed to go. I didn't understand. It might even been the first week of school, so it's so daunting. I got on stage, and then they gave me a mic, and I was 10, didn't know English. Then I couldn't think of a single song, and I didn't know English. I sang Avita, Don't Cry For Me, Argentina, and not even in English, but just in syllabus that I'd heard. This is, I think, was the craziest thing. It was very traumatic. Then they gave me a T-shirt, and I'd wanted Amnesty International T-shirt. That moment was It was interesting because my choir teacher came out or music teacher, and I hadn't met her at the school yet. And she came out. And as I got off the stage and got this T-shirt, she just took me straight into choir lesson. So I didn't even sit in the rest of the assembly.

[00:55:47.780] - Speaker 1
And they took me straight into the choir room with 30 other kids doing choir. And then we'd come out of lessons and do choir lessons whenever she needed us. She put me in the choir team. That was weird because I was learning all these Jesus songs. But it's because she obviously felt really sorry for me. She was like, Okay, this kid really wants to sing, but I wasn't know English and stuff. It's weird thinking back, thinking, wow, the first school I went to, the first term, I was in a choir team. Half of the lessons I didn't really do. Then Then my drama teacher came, and because I was good at painting, she took me out of classes for the rest of the day to paint drama sets and things. So between music and painting, that's all I was doing.

[00:56:45.620] - Speaker 2
Which is great. They were supporting your interest in the arts. You got lucky.

[00:56:51.320] - Speaker 1
I got lucky because I didn't have to speak a lot. I was painting sets and then doing my choir singing. And then again, I was like, I wish I'd gone to singing lessons in Sri Lanka during your war or even knew how to sing in English. I thought, Yeah, I'm definitely a painter. That's what I am. I'm definitely an artist, but not a musician. I think from then on, that was my thing. Until Run DMC put out Tricky. My school was turning 10 years old, and then they needed an event to celebrate that. And they were choosing people in each class to put together an event. And there was three girls that they chose, which was me, a Korean girl and a Pakistani girl. And they were like, You guys are going to do a dance routine. And we chose Tricky as that song. And so we did a little dance routine on this 10th anniversary, and we killed it. We won the first prize, and then we represented the school in the borough, and then we got to represent the borough in the whole of England. And they kept sending us around the country to do this dance routine.

[00:58:25.580] - Speaker 1
And it changed my life because even though I didn't know how to speak English, it made me really famous overnight in the school. And then everyone was like, Teach me this move. Teach me that move. So we got to take this dance routine to, I don't know, we had to go to Liverpool or somewhere and do this huge contest. We won a week doing activities and all of this stuff. I remember thinking, well, dancing doesn't need English. You I just need to wear them. That's cool. It changed my persona at school after that, and I became known as the dancer girl. That was always part of my personality. Then it just as a teenager, that's also why I think that was really important to me. Hip hop was so much about that. We'd stay up and record everything. Then after that, we switched it up to the Cookie Crew, which was a local girl rap group from Clapham. We were like, Let's represent. But yeah, definitely run DMC He's tricky was the catalyst to my presence at school. That's what I was saying. From that, then I started getting more into harder hip We never did anything mainstream.

[01:00:04.100] - Speaker 1
But it was an interesting time because the late '80s was also the golden era of Jamaican dance or music. Then we had our own thing, which is like jungle being born out of those two things coming together. So it was just the best time in London for music as a teenager. It was amazing.

[01:00:25.400] - Speaker 2
Was it more hanging out with your friends listening to music or were you going to clubs yet?

[01:00:30.140] - Speaker 1
I was starting to go to clubs.

[01:00:32.180] - Speaker 2
And what was the club scene like?

[01:00:35.840] - Speaker 1
Well, the Jamaican scene was everywhere. It transcended a space. You could go to the park, and you'd have a sound system, and then there'd be a warehouse, or people would have them in pubs or clubs or house parties. It was everywhere. The raves obviously happened in proper rave environments. And then with hip hop, yes, you could go to a club, but the club would go through the genres. So every club you went to in London at the time, they would do a 30 minutes set. There was dance floor, 30-dance hip It was like a club, a bit of RnB, and then they close it off with a bit of soul, and then everyone leaves the club. And it was the same template. It's amazing to have your teenage years with so much music. But that is the thing, I think, coming from the war and everything. And also, Tamil music is very beat and drum-heavy. So it was just like a natural progression to be like, Oh, yeah, the danceful thing and hip hop connects with the rhythmic aspect of what you know.

[01:01:56.040] - Speaker 2
Was the Tamil music folk music or pop music? Music?

[01:02:01.740] - Speaker 1
You have Hindi songs that were from Bollywood, and they were a lot more dreamy and much more like the Hindustani ragas and stuff. It was much more about the singing and everything. But Tamil music in the south is very much to do with the rhythm. We have the counting, hitting the stick, and doing Baradhanatiam dancing. The Baradhanatium The original classic dancing. The music we have is called the Karnatek music, and it's all based on maths. Even our dancing is hitting your heel into the ground, making a beat.

[01:02:45.620] - Speaker 2
Can you play me a classic piece of demo music?

[01:02:49.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah. This is a movie that came out in 1980 or something, that explains this music. What are the lyrics about? It's more religious, but this is also in Telangu, which is a different dialect to Tamil, but it's still in Tamil Nadu.

[01:04:09.300] - Speaker 2
Is most of the music religious or spiritual?

[01:04:12.150] - Speaker 1
This one is a bit religious because this movie is about a guru, and it's about him trying to teach classical music, but the kids are disrespectful. And Not just the title, but he's trying to pass on the knowledge. And then he... So this movie is about the teaching of the music. So I loved this movie when it first came out because I was like, whoa. It gave me so much knowledge. It's like someone learning how to sing and stuff, I would learn about music from this film. That's why this was a very important movie for me. But yeah, I just always noticed that there was a difference in the sound of the Toms. And the bass kick drum and these things in Tamil music as opposed to Hindi music. I just knew that there was another drum. And so when I made Kala, that was my first trip back to India and to find what that is.

[01:05:33.150] - Speaker 2
Did you go back to Sri Lanka?

[01:05:34.700] - Speaker 1
I went back to Sri Lanka in 2001 before 9/11.

[01:05:39.980] - Speaker 2
And what was the feeling there compared to your childhood experience?

[01:05:45.120] - Speaker 1
Well, I just came out of art school. So when I went back, everyone's like, What's happening? And really, I- Had the place changed? First of all, I didn't get up to the north to where I came from. They wouldn't allow me. But I was brave, so I was like, No, I'm going to go. But when I arrived, this crazy event had happened where this teacher was attacked in broad daylight at the roundabout in Times Square equivalent in the capital by all these army soldiers. And there was a massive riot and protests in the street for women's rights because Because all the army soldiers got acquitted. We were having the Rodney King equivalent in Colombo at the time to do with this female teacher that had been raped in broad daylight. I didn't know this, but we landed and my mom was like, You're not going out. She locked the door and she locked me in the house. Then I was there. She knew that it was going to influence me quite a lot. And I was like, I need to go to this protest. Yeah, she really tried to control that. But I was like, I'm going to do something about it.

[01:07:12.980] - Speaker 1
And then I would find basically everyone in the street in all the neighborhood and everything in the capital, they were all some family that had been affected. Everyone had a story. I was like, Wow, I don't even have to go all the way to the north. Even if I look on this street, there's enough people that are like, My son's in jail. My sister was killed. My husband's missing. Every single door I knocked on. And then I was like, Wow, this is crazy. That's the documentary I tried to make, but I wanted the shots. I was like, I'm going to go to the Tiger Territory. I'm going to get into camp, and I'm going to film what they're doing. Because I was curious about what 20-something-year-old girl was like in the movement as opposed to the way I was living in art school.

[01:08:17.290] - Speaker 2
It could have been your life.

[01:08:20.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah. My cousin, who was my age, he went missing. That's where MIA comes from. They wrote and said, he's been found. And then they're like, no, he's dead. And then they were like, no, he's found, but he's in a vegetative state and doesn't remember who he is. And there were so many mixed stories. So I was like, okay, I'm going to make a documentary. It's called MIA. I'm going to go to Sri Lanka. I'm going to find him. And I'm going to figure out everything else as well in the meantime. And so when I got there, it was just so much bureaucracy. You had to have a visa to go down the street to buy a pint of milk. If you're a Tamil and you had to get the thing and get that and get the stamp, report the police station, have the police come and check your bag before you It was all crazy stuff that you just could not live. Everybody was just so muted. I remember having an M&M CD, and I was in the warzone, and I'm like, Listen to this. It'll make you feel something. People were like, No, don't put it on.

[01:09:35.360] - Speaker 2
Everybody's in fear.

[01:09:36.960] - Speaker 1
Yes. I took out a nail polish, and I was like, Do you want this? And they were like, No, take it away from me because It will look like I'm making an effort and I'm attracting attention. And I was like, Wow, this is crazy. And then I went to join the tigers, and I was like, I want to cross over into the territory. I think this is when... I don't know when Mary Colvin, she was a journalist, that went and she got shot in the eye. I'm like, I want to be a journalist. I need to go and interview them or film it or something. And they were It was like, No, you can't go.

[01:10:18.180] - Speaker 2
Then just as I was- Did you want to go to learn more? Tell me what you were thinking.

[01:10:25.900] - Speaker 1
I felt really guilty that I was having this life in England and all the girls that I'd gone to school with were experiencing a totally different fate.

[01:10:37.800] - Speaker 2
So somehow you escaped.

[01:10:40.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:10:40.880] - Speaker 2
You felt guilty that why were you the one that got out? Is that right?

[01:10:46.920] - Speaker 1
It was a bit like, why was I the one to get out? But it was also like, I don't want to just forget that they're there. So I went back and I was like, What can I do? But everyone's just like, Just don't do anything. Just leave and be grateful. Yeah.

[01:11:08.240] - Speaker 2
Also, by going back, you were drawing attention to them, which they probably didn't want.

[01:11:11.940] - Speaker 1
Yes. So they were like, Wait, you're walking around here with a Puma T-shirt on? And that was banned. Then you had some camo cool shit that you got from whatever, Notting Hill market. You have no idea how this impacts us. Then Then that bit of dye hair of yours, it looks like you're a tamo tagu girl that's been in the jungle in the sun, and their hair grows brown because they have no choice. They've been in the jungle in the sun, and they got brown hair. You just come in here saying it's fashion because Kate Moss has got it, and you're just going to get us killed.

[01:11:49.250] - Speaker 2
That's interesting.

[01:11:50.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:11:51.230] - Speaker 2
You have no way of knowing that.

[01:11:53.040] - Speaker 1
No. It's all stuff you're learning because you get stopped at the check point and then just like, What's up with your brown hair? You're like, What? Have you not seen Vogue? My mom was just like, You're a light bulb. Liability. You're staying indoors, and I'm locking the door and throwing away the key. I had to learn about everything. And then by the end, we were like, Okay, let's go back to London. And they blew up the airport, the government part of the warplanes in the international airport. And the tigers did the suicide mission and blew up all the warplanes. So the airport shut down and I couldn't leave. And so I was there for another month. That's unbelievable. Yeah. And I was like, Well, Fair enough, because the news I'd got the whole time I was there was that the reason why I couldn't see my childhood house is because they were deploying these fighter planes and bombing the north at the time. So I got to know the fighter planes really well and know about them really well because I was learning about what was happening and why I couldn't go there. I knew how many they bore, what year they were made, how much it cost the government, all of that.

[01:13:16.380] - Speaker 1
So when they blew it up, I was like, well, they did spend a long time saying, please don't do that because you're bombing schools and hospitals and civilian areas, and it's a no-fly zone, and they didn't listen. And this is cause and effect. In a war, you're as bad as the monster you're fighting. I understood that. The reason why the town of Tigres were called ruthless is because the government was ruthless. Your gage in the range of roofless you are. It's dependent on what you're fighting. You can't call one-side roofless without knowing why they're like that. Then I was watching the news and on the BBC, they're like, Oh, the tigers have bombed civilian planes, and here's all these crying tourists running. And I was like, But that's just not true, because I was there. And it was like three in the morning and nobody was at the airport, and they were just like, Running these weird clips and it's a propaganda thing. And I was like, Wow, that's mad. So my London friends would call me and be like, We saw this, we saw that. And I'll be like, But that didn't happen. I don't know.

[01:14:31.480] - Speaker 1
Just how I open my eyes, that was my awakening moment to how the world runs. And I was like, okay, I can't join the tigers. Either I could be a journalist or I need to make this documentary and to figure out what to do because I feel really bad for my cousins and people that are living like this. This is their youth. And, yeah, I came back. At that age, I knew that taking drugs wasn't an option, but that was the scene in London. When I got into music, I was like, I don't have the luxury of all of that. You still have a seriousness, and it's not for fun. It is like journalism.

[01:15:29.660] - Speaker 2
Would you Can you say you're primarily an activist and that it comes out through different forms of art?

[01:15:36.820] - Speaker 1
Not really, because I love music and all aspects of music.

[01:15:41.620] - Speaker 2
You like making different kinds of music as well? I do. It's not only documentary replacement music.

[01:15:48.380] - Speaker 1
It's not. I like the thing that music taps you into. Yeah. That's so vast. But I felt like I had a role in that precise moment to do that. Because it wasn't a selfish drive. It's not like, I want to be a musician. It was like, there's something urgent. This thing is working, and I'm not forcing it. I was coming out of St. Martin's. I was creative and doing everything. But the music thing was my last on the list.

[01:16:28.120] - Speaker 2
How did you get into St. Martin's?

[01:16:30.200] - Speaker 1
I just blagged it.

[01:16:31.980] - Speaker 2
Tell me how.

[01:16:33.720] - Speaker 1
I started to come into LA a lot because the music drew me here. I was learning- Before St.

[01:16:42.390] - Speaker 2
Martin's?

[01:16:42.720] - Speaker 1
Before St. Martin's, I was doing GCSEs. And someone is when they came up with that theory, if you listen to music, you can revise more. That was an invented theory in the '90s, and I was like, amazing. I'd listen to hip hop or R&B while I was doing homework. And what I realized is that by the end of the exams, I was so versed on the songs and not really what was in the books. And so the day my results came out, I just got on a plane, and I'm like, I want to go and meet the people who made this thing. I want to go where they are. So I got a plane ticket to Los Angeles. My thing was that I'm going to meet Snoop Dogg.

[01:17:32.960] - Speaker 2
How old were you at the time?

[01:17:35.820] - Speaker 1
I must have been 17.

[01:17:37.860] - Speaker 2
Do you have other friends who had come to Los Angeles your age?

[01:17:40.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I had a cousin who was my age. I see. She was already here. I hadn't seen her since the war in Sri Lanka. She left and came to California, and I left and went to London at the same time. Then we hadn't seen each other.

[01:17:55.640] - Speaker 2
When you came to California, did you see her? Mm-hmm.

[01:17:57.860] - Speaker 1
She picked me up at the airport, and then we were in all the clubs meeting everyone.

[01:18:04.060] - Speaker 2
Good experience?

[01:18:05.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I mean, I loved it. It was the best. We were out all the time, met all the rappers. I got to see the Fugees at the time when they were coming up. Great. Met pretty much all the rappers. My 21st birthday party, I went to Nas's album launch. I was coming here all the time. So every time when I came here, I'd miss my chance to go to the uni I wanted because I would just miss the application process. I didn't care. So I went back and I had to go to a uni. Otherwise, my mom was going to kill me. So I was standing at the bus stop one day, and it was outside Saint Martens. And I'm like, I'm going to go here. And I just-Was it a hard school to get into normally? Yeah, the hardest. But I just made a decision that's where I'm going to go. And then I just called up the art department every day, exactly at the same time, like one 37. And I was like, Hey, I'm looking for the head of the art department. And I found him, and then just called him every day.

[01:19:24.600] - Speaker 1
And he's like, Every time I try to bite into my sandwich, I get this annoying phone call. What are you doing? And I was just like, Please just give me a chance. I just need 10 minutes to come and convince you I need to study film at this school. It was the head of Fine Art. And He was like, Fine. I'll give you 10 minutes and you can bring your work and bring your portfolio. And then the next day, I walked in and I had nothing because I didn't do the course that you're supposed to do before you get in. I had terrible grades, and I didn't have work experience and stuff. He spat his sandwich out, and he started laughing. He's like, Are you joking? Do you know how many people suffer to get into this course. We have 16,000 applicants for 20 spaces, and you could just waltz in here with nothing. I was like, I just know I'm going to make the best movie out of all the other people you've let in. I also can't comprehend that one human being has the power to say yes or no, to change the direction of a human beings life.

[01:20:44.600] - Speaker 1
And I was like, on paper, the person I am is I could either be a drug dealer or a prostitute or work at Tesco's or be an adult and have loads of kids claiming benefit. This is my future. I'm going to get on that bus outside this college, go to King's Christ, which was the notorious area for crackheads and prostitution. I was like, I'm going to go and do that. If I become the craziest criminal or a hooker, get arrested and go to jail, my film is still going to be a bad film. Then he was like, That's the emotional blackmail. I was like, But it is true. You have the power to change somebody's life right now. He was like, Okay, just go home. Then when I went home, he called 20 minutes later, and then he said, I had a chat with the art department, and you're really lucky. One person dropped out because they got sick and can't come anymore, and we're going to give this place for you.

[01:21:54.660] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:21:55.620] - Speaker 1
It was so weird. I was just like, Whoa. And then he- You willed it to happen. I did. And he said to me when he left, because after that, he retired, he said, We gave it to you because we decided that you got a hook spa. And I had to go and look up what that meant. There was no Google at the time. And basically, he said, At the end of the day, everybody who came into this art school followed the rules to get in. But that's not who we're looking for. We want people who don't care about the rules. And so we believe you that you might actually do something. And that's what he said.

[01:22:37.480] - Speaker 2
And how was the experience at school?

[01:22:39.040] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it was amazing. I loved it. It was just no rules. It wasn't practical It's not like going to UCLA. It was very conceptual. So you'll sit there and talk about why God odd or Derek Jarman filmed a blue screen.

[01:22:55.320] - Speaker 2
A real art education.

[01:22:56.740] - Speaker 1
Yes. It was interesting. We learned about movements and artists and the concept of being an auteur and being strong about where you're coming from. I was into technical stuff as well. I wanted to learn those things, material, filmmaking, and this and that. I wasn't so into the surreal things, but I think I found certain artists who pushed boundaries because they believed in something and sticking to that was very useful then when I became a musician. Because if your idea is not strong, you're just weak and you will fall for anything. I think those years at St. Martin's definitely strengthened, don't come to the table unless you have this strong idea vibes. I knew that already. It was It's the same for music. I wouldn't enter the music territory if there was nothing new you're bringing to it. It had to matter.

[01:24:10.940] - Speaker 2
Do you think of yourself as spiritual?

[01:24:13.160] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Everything is coded in my life. I just have the revelation in certain moments when I guess God decides you're ready to have that information But everything is already what it is. I'm just connecting dots and going, Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Like, all the time. But everything is as is, and it is. It's quite bizarre. Even going through being a Christian now, it doesn't make me any less the thing I was. Suddenly, I don't lose all that information.

[01:25:03.180] - Speaker 2
Did you convert to Christianity?

[01:25:04.800] - Speaker 1
I got baptized, yeah. I wouldn't call it a conversion, but I'd accepted being a Hindu before. But what I realized is that everything is always present. It's not so cut and dry like now you're in this phase. It's just a different way of understanding and a different way of existing. Right now, this makes the most sense in my life. And the Hindu phase was so chaotic, but I had the energy to deal with that and make sense of it. Also, it's just a bit of myself I'd never paid attention to because, like I said, my father's family was Catholic, and my mom's a Christian, and my grandma, her mom was a Christian, but I never just...

[01:25:56.600] - Speaker 2
Was there an event or a moment that brought you back into this?

[01:26:03.710] - Speaker 1
Yes. I had a vision of Jesus Christ.

[01:26:08.560] - Speaker 2
How long ago?

[01:26:10.540] - Speaker 1
It was like 217.

[01:26:13.220] - Speaker 2
Can you describe it?

[01:26:15.740] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I met you after that. When I met you, I was still in that transitional period. I would still say I was 50/50, which is why the martyr record It was called M-A-T-A, and it was a 50/50 record. It was a journey where I was coming out of the chaos and trying to come to this other place. But I couldn't fully describe what that place was. But I had the vision and I knew it was real. This is another thing about the music industry. When people say, Oh, talk about how terrible the music industry is or what happened. I can't Because for me, it was always a spiritual situation. But I always had this other bit where I was like, What is this? Of course, there's the political thing and there's the artistic thing. There's the funny thing, or there's you messing with society and making things happen. But there's always this respect for some weird spiritual presence that I was like, there's something, but didn't know what. Then I heard the saying, You're a citizen of the world, and your religion is to do good. I was like, That's a great slogan. That is what I am.

[01:27:41.620] - Speaker 1
I'm going to live by that, and that's going to be my mantra. I didn't really think more about that. And then I made Calla under that spiritual idea that it's just how everything goes. Then I made the Maya album, which was much much more about Islamophobia. It was my connection to Islam, even though I'm not Muslim. I was like, they're going through something. Like, what is this?

[01:28:09.330] - Speaker 2
You related to their struggle.

[01:28:11.760] - Speaker 1
Yes. I was like, they need a voice. And even though they would reject me because I'm not a Muslim and I do everything wrong, like I'm smoking weed or going out, I make club music and all of the stuff. But I sympathize and empathize with this group of people that's going through this thing. And that was the beginning where I was fighting for that thing so hard, even though I wasn't religious. And that was the beginning where I started feeling something weird. And I started feeling like a presence of something. And I would start seeing things that I couldn't explain. But it was still beautiful. I was like, What is going on?

[01:29:05.080] - Speaker 2
Would you say it was channeling?

[01:29:06.700] - Speaker 1
I don't know what it was, but my album was called Maya, and that's the post-war. The Sri Lankan War came to an end the year I made that record, and I was extremely depressed. I also made that in America. I never knew about the Christian side of life or conspiracy theories or the dark side. I remember signing sleighbells, and they came around to my house and they graffeded a pentagram on my studio wall. My other artist at the time, he was like, You know what that means? I'm like, No. I just thought it's like rebellion and anarchy or whatever. It's close. I didn't know what it was. He's like, No, that's a symbol that represents a portal. It's like spirits can come and go through this thing. I was like, What is this? When I look back at the Maya album, it sounds confusing because the human part of me was going through loss and tragedy, and then also birth of my son, which was the opposite. Then the spiritual aspect, it's like you're still dealing with talking about a demographic of people and just all people who might be controlled or some thing, but I didn't know what.

[01:30:48.680] - Speaker 1
It was more like, I guess, it's just why I was channeling in California. People in California needed to talk about privacy and tech. Whereas it wasn't my thing. But that's just what I picked up on, and that's just what came out on the record. But Maya, on a spiritual level, means the same. It's illusion, and it's about deception and breaking through the lies. And all the artwork for it was tunnels. And I was just naturally describing it without really thinking about it. And all the artwork for all the songs was about going through this tunnel, going through this tunnel. And then it dawned me that Maya afterwards. It dawned me that Maya is not my real name, and it was a fake name, and that I shouldn't have named that record Maya because it's not real. But then that is what that was describing, something that's not real. So I was like, Oh, maybe it's really great that everyone hated it because they're supposed to resist the Maya. And I was like, That's perfect. And then everyone's like, You need to get out of music. You're shit because this is a really terrible record. And I was like, Yeah, but you don't understand the big picture.

[01:32:07.080] - Speaker 1
It's actually perfect. How it made sense afterwards. I don't know any of this while going through it. But having come out, you're just like, whoa, that's actually pretty on point. And then that is the only once I had accepted that because I was like, I have to self-therapy. So I can't traumatize everyone else just because I feel traumatized by the war coming to an end. That's not a good thing, but I can let go. And one of the ways I can let go is to remember that every Tamil who died is a Hindu, and it's going to be born again. So it's fine. Just embrace Hinduism for them and just pray that their souls and spirits don't come back to Earth because they believe in reincarnation, that they don't come back and perpetuate the same trauma on the human race. And so I was like, Oh, there must be a process that spirit goes through to clean itself before it comes back, I think. So I was like, Oh, I'm going to just focus on that for a few months. So I went to India and I was like, I think it's really fascinating that you would die.

[01:33:35.900] - Speaker 1
Then something has to happen where you lose that memory or you learn from what you've experienced. Where is this? They go. And while I was there, we were doing a photoshoot, and some guy was like, What green do you want? And we're like, It's the type of green. And I remember my mom always would say, Parroqu green. So we went on Google and we put parroqu green to give him a picture, and it popped up my real name, Matange, who is the Goddess of Music. And we're like, Oh, my God. And her mantra was aim, which is M-I-A backwards. Yeah, and her mudra was middle finger. I'd just been kicked out of America for the middle finger.

[01:34:23.200] - Speaker 2
This plane kicked out of America?

[01:34:25.280] - Speaker 1
Well, I went on the Super Bowl.

[01:34:28.120] - Speaker 2
The halftime The Time Show?

[01:34:30.410] - Speaker 1
Yes. And then I got sued for the middle finger because I was like, We didn't give a shit like that. So the NFL was suing me for 16 million.

[01:34:40.340] - Speaker 2
They were suing you?

[01:34:42.720] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:34:44.280] - Speaker 2
This is a crazy story.

[01:34:46.820] - Speaker 1
So I was doing the show with Madonna. That's also a funny thing. She's called Madonna. And my real name, M-A-T-H-A, it means Madonna, too. It It's Mary. But I didn't even think of that until this year. That's what I mean. Sometimes things are just there, but you just get shown things like when it's right. Anyway, so I did this That's what I did. I did a thing with Madonna, and she was- On the show, you did a hand gesture. I did a hand gesture, and I didn't really compute how big the Super Bowl was. I'd never watched it before in my life, and I'd never gone to an American football game or anything like that.

[01:35:32.600] - Speaker 2
Was it a preconceived thing or it just happened in the moment?

[01:35:35.330] - Speaker 1
It just went with the lyrics.

[01:35:38.180] - Speaker 2
Do you remember what the lyrics were?

[01:35:39.510] - Speaker 1
I Don't Give A Shit.

[01:35:40.580] - Speaker 2
Oh, okay.

[01:35:41.900] - Speaker 1
Pretty punk. Yeah. Didn't think anything of it. Yeah. And then it was just the most explosive thing. And I was like, whoa, I did not see that coming. But then I found this diety that was called this, and her mudra was a middle finger, and her mantra was M-I-A backwards.

[01:36:05.520] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[01:36:06.640] - Speaker 1
And I was like, and she was versed in 64 arts, which is called Calla, and that's my mom's name.

[01:36:12.540] - Speaker 2
So it all makes sense after.

[01:36:14.220] - Speaker 1
It always makes sense after. You never know what you're going to go through, and then you go through it, and then it tells you- Whatever happened with the NFL? They dropped the case. Good. Yeah.

[01:36:25.920] - Speaker 2
I'm shocked that they sued you.

[01:36:28.100] - Speaker 1
Because I said, I will make a documentary about it.

[01:36:31.260] - Speaker 2
That's why they dropped it? Yes. I see.

[01:36:33.620] - Speaker 1
The documentary thing is still useful.

[01:36:36.520] - Speaker 2
Threats have worked out well for you. It got you into school. Yes. It got them to drop a lawsuit against you.

[01:36:43.040] - Speaker 1
Yes. I'm very Obviously.

[01:36:47.780] - Speaker 2
What would you say you're afraid of in the world?

[01:36:52.140] - Speaker 1
Well, I think that after that being really comfortable and then one day I had a vision of Jesus Christ. I found out that Matange also was the godness of spoken word, which I thought was like rap music or something, and poetry, but also truth. Me supporting WikiLeaks and Freedom of Press and saying connected to the Google, connected to the government, because it's true. Even though I know it's detrimental to my career, I just had to say it because it was true. Like With that, the vision of Jesus Christ, it was true. I wasn't hallucinating.

[01:37:34.500] - Speaker 2
I think most artists are supportive of Julian Assange, no? Do you know any artists? Now, I think- I was going to say, do you know any artists who are not?

[01:37:41.760] - Speaker 1
In 2010, 2011, it was still a bit taboo. I see. But I made a WikiLeaks mixtape in 2010. I was very public with it thing. Anyway, so when I had the vision, even going back to someone like Julian Assange, who doesn't really believe in God or is very logical person, to be like, I had a vision of Jesus Christ. It was very annoying. I visit him in jail.

[01:38:16.860] - Speaker 2
Julian, not Jesus.

[01:38:18.560] - Speaker 1
Julian, yeah. I had to be like, I saw Jesus. And he's like, It doesn't exist.

[01:38:24.100] - Speaker 2
You saw it.

[01:38:25.010] - Speaker 1
So obviously- I saw it. So even him, I had to- You have more information than he does. I understand. I just know that everyone in my life is like, What are you talking about? Including my family. So I was like- You're a Christian? Yeah. That's interesting. Exactly. So I was like, Yes. And they're like, Why would it happen to you? You're a musician. You don't go to church. But I don't know why it happened to me. Then I was like, You're right. Why? And it is about speaking truth. And Jesus Christ, that is what you can say about him, is that he is about that. He's about the truth. And there's no bells and whistles with it. It's not like Hinduism. It comes with so much decoration or the Egyptian gods. Jesus is nothing. And he's so boring in that sense, in a creative sense. But it's pretty amazing. And my journey in it has been, I listen to this pastor who clarifies a lot of things. So it's not just the stories of the past, but explains the world we're in right now, and it just makes sense. He says that you can have heaven on Earth.

[01:39:50.080] - Speaker 1
And a lot of people find this very, very controversial statement. And I've already experienced all of the backlash around me for saying this. But His whole thing is Jesus died so we can inherit what he intended for us. And that there was a race between Jesus and Satan to implement the will that they wanted for the human race. But only one of them died, which means that's the will that we inherited. So Satan has to come back to Earth and convince everyone it didn't happen and that didn't inherit that and that everything is terrible. And a lot of people get confused, and they stay in their trauma, and we stay in the conflict. And I'm not saying that world doesn't have conflict. The world always has conflict. And creation, destruction, and God has wrath, and all of that. But at the same time, half of the trauma and despair, we can overcome it if we know That we've already inherited the will of Jesus Christ, not the will of Satan. And that is that.

[01:41:07.020] - Speaker 2
That feels good.

[01:41:07.940] - Speaker 1
It feels great to know that. That means you can just have it. It's there. And even understanding all the other spiritual things that I've been through already. It's like that whole Egyptian thing. The Egyptian religion is really chaotic, but it's the same chaos as Hinduism. You can see that that's why a monotheic Abrahamic religion came after all of these crazy ones, because it just seems like a natural progression. But it's like, just as the timeline goes from one religion to the other, I just see that we're living in this. Like, yes, this was totally relevant 6,000 years ago. This was relevant 3,000 years ago. But around me right now, this is the one I'm tapping into, and it makes sense.

[01:42:06.300] - Speaker 2
And all the streams lead to the same ocean. It's all essentially a version of the same thing.

[01:42:16.000] - Speaker 1
It's true.

[01:42:17.300] - Speaker 2
Tell me the principle behind clothing with metal in it.

[01:42:24.500] - Speaker 1
Well, it's a combination. So it is a yoga principle because yogis We would drink out of copper bottles. It's just grounding the water, and it's antibacterial, and it just makes it more neutral when you consume it. So when I was in India in 2015, somebody gave us a copper bottle and explained that, and I'd never heard of it before, and I was like, Oh, that's really amazing. How do I fit stuff like this into my life? And I was always been curious. And then one day, I went to visit Julian Assange at the embassy when he was in the embassy. And I met a guy who had this fabric, and he was making wallets. So I remembered that.

[01:43:18.240] - Speaker 2
What were the wallets for?

[01:43:20.200] - Speaker 1
It was to get you off-grid. I see. So he was a journalist, I think, and he was going to Afghanistan or something. And he was like, Oh, journalists would really need this. So that was my introduction to Nickel. And then a friend of mine called Adam Harvey, he did an art piece where he made a burqa made out of this fabric, and it was in the New York Museum. And I bought it, and I was like, Oh, this is really brilliant. And then I don't know what happened to him. He didn't really do anything with it. And that was like, ages ago, like eight, nine years ago or something. But I think the fabric was so expensive back then. It was such a novelty. His whole thing was about stealth mode and anti-drone wear. So that was another thing. And so I'd always been interested in fabric with function is amazing, but it's just not affordable. And people always said, Oh, why don't you have a brand? And I was like, But I would need a brand that's doing something. Why They add to pollution unless there's a purpose. Then when I was away, I realized my son is also getting older.

[01:44:43.300] - Speaker 1
He's a teenager. He's always on the gadget. I'm not going to get him away from California and make him live in a cave. It's not going to happen. I've lost that war. He's at school here in America. He uses the phone to order food Food, convenience, Ubers. He goes to the classroom. They use laptops now, not a slate like when I was at school. So I was like, How do I get around this? So it was just like a combination of all these things. I was like, I want him to wear tracksuit bombs where he could put a laptop on his lap, and I'm still going to have grandchildren.

[01:45:25.360] - Speaker 2
So the clothing protects you from radiation, EMF, With many manmade negative impacting energies.

[01:45:35.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because we're not going to undo it. And the tech world is saying, It's fine. We can have that capacity to consume all of these extra frequencies, right? Because they're saying, We're already electrical beings. I get that. So when Elon Musk says, You don't have to worry about EMF, but at the same time, it's the scale of it. I went India last year, and a friend of mine was like, You should have a brand. And she expected crazy H&M Topshop accessible, Indians can buy it brand. And I tried for a month to go around and look at factories, and it just didn't gel. Everything was difficult. And then I got to Indonesia, and my cousin came and she said, Oh, six years ago, you came and gave me a parcel to put in the garage. And she said, I'm moving out, so here's your package. And so six years ago, apparently, I went and left this parcel. When I opened it up, it was this fabric. And I'd ordered it from China and just left it in a garage and forgot about it. And I was like, Oh, that's the past me leaving something for the future me.

[01:46:56.200] - Speaker 1
Sometimes that happens where I don't even remember. Yeah. And so that was it.

[01:47:02.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and it came right at the right time.

[01:47:04.280] - Speaker 1
Right at the right time, I took that fabric, just made something happen, and it just everything clicked into place.

[01:47:12.920] - Speaker 2
So how long ago did you start the brand?

[01:47:16.280] - Speaker 1
We launched last June. But this is also like it goes hand in hand with my spiritual experience because I was doing this in between thing of how do I be this new me without losing the old me? Or am I supposed to? I don't know. It's like, does Jesus save you because you were already doing the right thing, or did he save you to make you not do that anymore and do a different thing? How confusing. And so then I found this pastor, and he was like, Yeah, you're going to do this thing in 90 days, this business, and everything's going to That click into place. And I don't know. The words were so powerful. I just like, Yeah, that just makes the most amount of sense. And before that, I was listening to a lot of podcasts and Having a social understanding of everything and really becoming overwhelmed with what was happening after COVID and everything and thinking like, what do you do to help people? And then he's like, it will reveal itself and it's going to happen and it's going to happen in 90 days. And then I was like, okay, all I have to do is just give it a chance.

[01:48:42.780] - Speaker 1
And then with 90 days, we designed the logo, made the clothes, started the thing, made the website, launched the brand in 90 days. Amazing. Yeah, it was pretty like super natural.

[01:48:54.140] - Speaker 2
The only place the clothes can be bought now are on the website?

[01:48:56.540] - Speaker 1
At the moment, yes. But obviously, we're going to go into phase two trying to get it out. It's brand new. Yeah, it's a baby.

[01:49:04.350] - Speaker 2
How many different pieces do you make?

[01:49:06.780] - Speaker 1
At the moment, we have about 35- That's a lot. To 40 things. People love it. A lot of people want kids' clothes.

[01:49:16.500] - Speaker 2
It's completely different than what anyone else is doing.

[01:49:20.180] - Speaker 1
It's so different. It's also very new. People are like, What is this? We don't even need this.

[01:49:25.970] - Speaker 2
Even if people don't care about the function of it, it feels It feels very forward. It feels science fiction.

[01:49:33.420] - Speaker 1
It is. It's moving the dial on fashion. It's very difficult to express this in such a short time because we are a small time scale. But the function is not even just singular function. It does have anti-tech, anti-surveillance function that all our bags get you off-grid. And then it has this other antibacterium blah, blah, blah, blah. And protects you against EMFs and protects unborn fetuses and stops all the rest of it. While we are in the most exponential growth tech period of our time in human history, where even in this government where they're saying, Hey, 500 billion is going to go into AI and the tech industry, not the climate industry, not healthcare, not education, into tech. Imagine how much more we are going to be relying on that because everyone has to make that 500 billion back.

[01:50:43.220] - Speaker 2
Interestingly, it's high tech clothing.

[01:50:46.740] - Speaker 1
Totally. It's understanding where we are, what time we're in, and going, Okay, we're going to provide a solution. It's not a battle, even though you make armor, and when you put armor on, you go into battle. But the battle here is information. It's to bring people knowledge because people die from lack of knowledge and lack of information. If tech invades our life to bring us information, and that's the whole thing, it's like, this is about information, and we're living in information age, then it's important that people are informed about the ways to protect their bodies and choosing when to be in this tech environment.

[01:51:40.040] - Speaker 2
Do you wear the clothing every day?

[01:51:42.220] - Speaker 1
I do, actually, yeah.

[01:51:43.800] - Speaker 2
How is the experience been since you've been wearing it.

[01:51:46.480] - Speaker 1
When I sleep in it, it's amazing. I think something must be happening. Also to test the clothes, I moved into a smart home. I'm very anti-smart homes, but the place I've rented, everything is so technological. When I wear it in bed, especially now we're in LA after the fires, they're going to be building smart homes and smart cities. To me, it's like it's a second skin to be in an environment like that. I need it.

[01:52:23.580] - Speaker 2
We also don't know with any new technology, we don't know the long term effects. At one point in time, asbestos was this new scientific discovery that was cheap insulation that was going to keep the world warm and turned out to be not so healthy.

[01:52:41.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah. We have technology all around us. It's in our pocket. Then it's in the sky with the satellite. I don't even think this is evil. I don't even think like that. I think everything has a balance. And so I do think that some of the technology reveals God and brings us closer and has a positive impact. But I do think there's people that will abuse it and that we've seen that. We're living in that time where you're seeing this. And it's like, you can't really live in ignorance and pretend it's not happening. And I don't know, sometimes I like wearing other clothes and colors, but it's not like Omni can't occupy that space either. So pretty revolutionary for keeping humanity going. Yes. That's the aim here is that as much as people believe that this is the end of the world and we're in a dire situation, I think it's possible to have heaven on Earth and that humanity can survive.
