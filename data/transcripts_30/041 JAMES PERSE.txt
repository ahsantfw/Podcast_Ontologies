[00:00:08.490] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammatin. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammatin.

[00:00:22.610] - Speaker 2
It's funny because I actually saw of a lot of my problems at work while I'm sleeping.

[00:00:29.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I understand.

[00:00:31.280] - Speaker 2
And I also come up with the best ideas while I'm sleeping. You also come up with the worst ideas while you're sleeping. But you'll sit there up at night, all night long, thinking about these ideas, good or bad, and then by morning, it actually solves the problem. Or you just kind of push it aside.

[00:00:49.270] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I have all kinds of rules with myself about not doing that.

[00:00:53.970] - Speaker 2
I'm very curious about that because I try to focus on my breathing. So when I start getting all worked up and I just going on and on and on and on, then if I can literally just focus in on nothing but my breath, then, you know, fall back asleep and then traveling and going all over the world, that makes me completely delirious when you're adding kind of the sleep deprivation in while your mind is going. I was born and raised going down to Cabo, probably since I was eight years old. And Cabo, it's truly, if I just get in my jeep and I just disappear on sort of the dirt roads by myself. There's something about the energy down there. There's something about that. Most people would think you're kind of crazy. Because I kind of geek out on trying to figure out and study a little bit about what is so calming about there. And I've got all these surfer and friends. They've been all over the world, and they always talk about there's something super special about the energy down there. Like, if they compare it to places all over the world that they've ever.

[00:02:10.280] - Speaker 2
You can imagine they've been in the middle of nowhere. But I believe it's something with the current, the meditative sound of the ocean. I start to get into all these kind of the different sounds of the ocean waves where if it's crashing and it's loud and it's constant white sound, that actually gives me anxiety when it's kind of like this meditative current that kind of calmly, it's this big wave. It's this big wave, this big crash, and then it sucks back, and it gives you a pause, and then it does it again. Because when you think about it, where we are is we're actually on the surf, so you can actually go on the ocean. It's in the middle of nowhere out on the East Cape, which is what I consider what it was like when I was growing up there. Was nothing there. And then I've watched for the last 20 years, the whole town got built up. But because the current in the main corridor of Cabo is so kind of violent and a heavy shorebreak, they really don't want people going in the water because it can get pretty aggressive. So, funny enough, it's this huge tourist destination, or I should say southern California destination.

[00:03:35.670] - Speaker 2
Amazing spot to go for two, three days and to just relax and sort know, put everything aside. But ironically, nobody's going in the ocean. They can sit in a swimming pool, beautiful sun, sit in a swimming pool and you feel like you did something all day long. And I just sort of say it's something to do with the ocean and the current, the way it just puts you in this, know, meditative mode. It's funny, I was in Dubai the other day, and I'm sitting there for the first time. I downloaded that calm app.

[00:04:09.490] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:04:10.370] - Speaker 2
But I was trying to find a wave that resembled that wave, and there was nothing. There was no sound. There was nothing that sort of reminded me of it.

[00:04:20.310] - Speaker 1
But maybe we have someone record the wave.

[00:04:22.620] - Speaker 2
It would be kind of love to hear it.

[00:04:24.290] - Speaker 1
I'm telling you, it's a good wave. It's a good sound.

[00:04:26.760] - Speaker 2
It's a great sound. And if you think about it, with all these people going down there, they're not doing anything. You're just like, how are you entertained for three days just sitting in a swimming pool and there's something that is relaxing you. Where we are is off the beaten path. So I kind of went off to the east Cape. It's sort of starting all over again. The property that we have down there is kind of built into the dunes, and it's very kind of minimalist and it's very kind of outdoor living. Our intent was to create, to be able to share. What I know is that know, when you think of everyone who is kind of same, know, work, Southern Cal, want that getaway, want to let it all behind. Not go to a resort where you're sort of in another bubble, but truly experience, it's like a personal retreat for.

[00:05:25.290] - Speaker 1
You that you're sharing and opening to other people.

[00:05:28.490] - Speaker 2
Pretty much, yes. It's my love, my passion. And then I wanted to sort of share that experience. And what's been fascinating is I was always nervous that people wouldn't get it, that they would say, where am I? Why? I'm out in the middle of nowhere. What is there to do? And I'm telling you, there hasn't been a single person because there are people who kind of live in that. They need to go from that insulated kind of bubble and feel safe and protected. And I'm telling you, there hasn't been anybody that hasn't gone to visit our property or experience this and haven't come back and felt changed where they have actually not just kind of recouped, but just felt alive and just felt what was so special of getting out of their typical environment, which says to me they feel and they see why I was so attracted to it, what it meant to me. And so for us, I've always kind of had this dream of going from a product brand to an experiential brand. And I've always put my own kind of personal experiences, and whatever I love is what I want to share.

[00:06:53.810] - Speaker 2
And that was the objective. And then in the same time as, you know, I'm just obsessed with architecture and I'm obsessed with construction. I'm obsessed with building.

[00:07:02.900] - Speaker 1
When did that start?

[00:07:04.390] - Speaker 2
It actually started, I think, at the beginning when I first started the clothing brand, we used to go to these trade shows and you were always just kind of stuck in someone's format or in a box. And I started to see other brands. Like, I would go to the magic show. I don't know if you remember the magic show in Las Vegas was the big apparel brand. And I would always look at companies like Calvin Klein, Massimo, and they would start to pull this brand image together, this environment, because back then, retail for Brands was not a big thing. Everyone sold early ninety s. It was ninety s? Yeah, early 90s, because I was out of high school in 91. So I got into this and it was early ninety s, and I would start to just go to these trade shows.

[00:08:05.610] - Speaker 1
Why did you go to the trade show?

[00:08:07.770] - Speaker 2
Well, if I go back to the beginning of the story, what really happened was the summer before I went to college, which lasted six months, but I was at boarding school, I thought I was going to be a hockey player. I was obsessed with it. Then I realized, when you go back east, I'm not going to be a professional hockey player. These kids are going to be professional hockey players. But I had a great time.

[00:08:32.870] - Speaker 1
Ice hockey.

[00:08:33.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah, ice hockey from so cal. It's strange, but yeah. So I came back home for the summer. My father. I grew up in this world of Maxfield high fashion retail store that my father exposed me to pretty much my whole life that I had no interest in.

[00:08:56.620] - Speaker 1
Tell me the whole story of Maxfield.

[00:08:58.710] - Speaker 2
So my father started Maxfield, and I'm going to say late 60s early 70s here in LA. This is actually fascinating because I'm starting to go into the depths of this with my father and try to understand how all the dots had connected. But the first store that he did, he opened on Santa Monica, Big Santa Monica and Doheny. So two or three doors down from the troubadour. So in the, let's call it the early 70s, he had started as, like, I think he had started with jeans, and then he got into corkies was his big explosion. But what my father started doing is he started going internationally. He started discovering brands that are such massive brands today. Whether it was Giorgio Armani, who was still know, in a closet, to Yoji yamamoto.com, de Garcian. I mean, I can go on and on from Rick Owens, eventually chromeharts and so on and so forth, but at.

[00:10:03.910] - Speaker 1
A time when all of those were.

[00:10:06.050] - Speaker 2
Niche, cool boutique labels, they were unknown in America. That's the crazy part, is he was essentially one of the first dot connectors of going international, bringing it to Los Angeles in the entertainment industry, and obviously less commercial brands, the unknown, the avant garde, and he would put it know, musicians and actors and Hollywood agents and so on and so forth, and then the visibility would start know.

[00:10:41.440] - Speaker 1
Do you know where he got the inspiration to travel the world looking for these brands?

[00:10:45.590] - Speaker 2
That's a good question. It actually started in Europe. I just think one thing kind of led to the other. I think my stepmother at the time was fascinated with different fashion around the world.

[00:10:59.650] - Speaker 1
Did she have good taste as well?

[00:11:01.750] - Speaker 2
Yeah, she had very good taste. But it's interesting because I was young, so I don't really know what the evolution of my father's sense of taste. What I could tell you as a kid is that he always stood out like a sore thumb. So it didn't matter what it was like. He was into minimalism in the early 80s, where nobody knew he looked like the oddball by wearing kind of white head to toe or wearing linen head to toe or wearing. I mean, I have all these amazing old photos, but something that is so common today was totally out of the norm back in those days.

[00:11:46.870] - Speaker 1
And was his store a reflection of him?

[00:11:50.290] - Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure. It was definitely sort of always his constant evolution and his progression into fashion. He always had his point of view. He was a curator. He was somebody who knew how to pull all the pieces together and tell a story. I mean, from the architectural aspect, the environment, the experience, the products, the visual merchandising, and the attitude in the storytelling. So in the 80s, he was planting all these seeds for all these up and coming brands from all over the world, which eventually became a lot of local brands. The interesting thing about the first location being a few doors down from the troubadour, that was like the same time that people like Elton John were discovering their career at the troubadour. And so there has to be a link to their connection of discovering his store and then the brands that fell into his store because they all became his customers. All of them. And so there's this fascinating kind of connection between the troubadour. And then there was Dantana's as well.

[00:13:17.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So it's right in between.

[00:13:19.970] - Speaker 2
So it was like, I remember growing up as a kid, every sale, the sale was the big event of the year. And there'd be lines down the block, dantanas running down the street with cocktails and drinks on their trays, going back and forth to the store, like serving the store in those days, I guess you can just roll down the street with a bunch of cocktails. And so effectively, that was kind of what my exposure was, and I had no interest in it. I literally had no interest in it.

[00:13:53.950] - Speaker 1
No, but you were exposed to it. It was, in some ways, normal to you.

[00:13:58.880] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Well, it's funny, because what annoyed me became my obsession. So I'd sit there with my father, and he just couldn't just let it go. And he just had to figure out how to make this thing fit in this space and how to position it just right. And I just would be bored out of my mind and just annoyed. And I've become that person. There's no question you got the bug, but there's no question to your point that I was exposed to it, because you don't think about this as you're going along. My father would always say to me, like, open your mind. He forced everything on me. And my reaction was, reject. Reject. Total rejection. Right? Try this. Eat this. You look great. No. And I just listened to nothing. And it's funny because we have a joke to this day where when I used to go to him for advice as I was building my career, he would give me advice, and then I would do the opposite.

[00:15:16.480] - Speaker 1
Just because you didn't want to be like that.

[00:15:19.270] - Speaker 2
I don't know what it was. It's really funny because we're very opposite personalities and simultaneously, perfectly the same. So there's parallels and then there's complete differences, and somehow it just makes sense for us. It's our bond. I've been very lucky to have a father that I was so close with my entire life. And as I've gotten older, you start to realize where your father rubbed off on you and the things that he exposed you to and the million things he's pounding in your head. I used to tease him about all of it. If you went to his house, we're talking 30 plus years ago, and you look at the wood floors and he sanded them down because he took up the carpet and he sanded them down. They're these unfinished floors. And I'm like, you going to finish these floors anytime soon? And of course, then that becomes the thing. It's all about unfinished floors. And my father just had the magic eye that way. He just had the taste. And it took me years to sort of evolve, but I was somebody who did not learn by someone explaining it to me. I had to do it myself.

[00:16:44.770] - Speaker 2
I had to go through it myself. I had to go through trial and error. I had to make lots of mistakes. I had to practice and practice and practice. So one summer, I was driving his truck, doing deliveries, and I don't even know how this happened, but I got obsessed with baseball hats at the time and I asked him to let me make him some baseball hats. And so I made him some baseball hats for the shop. I put my label in it with like a phone number with an answering. So by the end of the summer, I put those hats in the store. And then all the Hollywood entertainment guys started calling me, I love your hats. Can you make my cast and crew gifts? And I want to make some of these hats. I'm doing a new movie, or it's a rock band wants to do it, or somebody's birthday wants to do. And so I was at college for a short six months, but I was doing these gigs on the side. Like, one of the first things I ever did was Martin Scorsese's 50th birthday party hats. A friend of mine called me and he's like, I need to do this.

[00:18:00.190] - Speaker 2
I need to do this in 48 hours. And I just figured it out and I got a taste of like, making a couple hundred bucks. And then I was like, ooh, this is like I am into. So I went. When I went away to school, I was from LA and I was know I'd been to boarding school, I'd done it. I'd kind of started to grow up. A lot of these kids were getting away from home from the first time. They were just a bit of a hot mess, learning about drinking and just being wild. And I was over it. I was just completely over it. And I remember calling my parents, and I called my father. I kept asking, can I come home? Can I come home? Can I hook up? My grades were a disaster. So I worked my grades up to just destroy it in six months. He's like, why don't you stick it out to transfer so you can get your grades up? I just said, I'm telling you, I'm just unhappy. I just want to get out of here. This is not for me. And he said, all right, let me think about.

[00:19:05.860] - Speaker 2
I'll call you back. And he said, I'll call you tomorrow. And he calls me 3 minutes later, and he says, you know what? If you're unhappy, come home. And I remember going like, oh, Jesus. What did I just. I do I know what I'm talking about? Do I know what I'm doing?

[00:19:24.060] - Speaker 1
No. It's scary.

[00:19:24.770] - Speaker 2
It was a little scary.

[00:19:25.790] - Speaker 1
Of course it's scary stuff.

[00:19:27.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So I went home, ended up in city college, and the next move was a friend of mine, and I decided, let's make some grateful dead bootleg hats and let's go chase. Let's go follow the dead around and sell these in the.

[00:19:47.290] - Speaker 1
Were you a deadhead?

[00:19:48.420] - Speaker 2
I was totally into the dead, okay? Totally into the dead. We were very passionate about it, and we loved every aspect of the environment and sort of the overall vibe, and we obsessed on it. And, in fact, we loved the small shows. When you wind your way back to Vegas or whatever, you're like, oh, this is chaos. After you just spend some time at Shoreline and Cal Expo, and you would have an experience. Anyways, we were in the parking lot selling these hats, and that was like, sort of the beginnings of it. And then you'd have to run away because we had a whole system, because they would come and confiscate illegal grape.

[00:20:33.410] - Speaker 1
You were a bootlegging?

[00:20:34.270] - Speaker 2
You were bootlegging.

[00:20:35.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:20:35.520] - Speaker 2
So they'd come and confiscate a box. But it was fun.

[00:20:41.100] - Speaker 1
Can you give me a quick lesson in bootlegging?

[00:20:43.400] - Speaker 2
Well, the truth was, in this case, when it was product, our quality destroyed every single thing out there, even the legitimate ones. Even the legitimate ones. It was all just junkie merchandise. So there was no real authenticity. It was just promotional, cheap merchandise and anybody who might be selling something on site. So I came from this world of quality, and my eye immediately was about quality. It was always about that. My vision from the very beginning was, how do I look at things? How do I identify things and figure out how to elevate it? It was always about not what existed, it's what didn't exist. And I would find things that I loved and was passionate and made the best version and try to create the best version.

[00:21:34.330] - Speaker 1
Yeah, great.

[00:21:35.230] - Speaker 2
So when we would have our hats, people would flip out because they were just nicer than everybody else's hats. They were just cooler. They were just. The quality was there. And as kids, we were off to the races. And ironically, I don't know how many years later, but let's just say now, five years ago or something, I got a call from Bob Weir. He stopped in one of the stores in Boston, left his name, and know I'd love to connect with James. And they call me up, say, bob Weir's trying to find you. My heart just dropped. I was just like, come again? Really? Like, what? And it's funny because I had just watched the documentary, and I kept looking at it going, I think he's wearing one of my shirts. Like, I think he is. It looks like he actually, Bob came and visited, you know, connected immediately. He wanted to do a collab together.

[00:22:33.640] - Speaker 1
Amazing.

[00:22:34.290] - Speaker 2
And he just opened the door, and we were off to the races, and it was just full circle. It was so special to me. It was so incredible. And I told him he had no idea. I told him, I said, do you realize? I started selling bootleg grateful Dead hats? And he loved it. It's been an amazing experience to go full circle and then create, now that we've built a brand, to be able to now collaborate together, it's so cool. So then I started to say, okay, I want to professionalize this a little bit, this merchandising business. And it was still merchandising.

[00:23:16.820] - Speaker 1
So it was like, you're doing Grateful Dead hats now. You're doing other brands.

[00:23:21.730] - Speaker 2
I was doing, like, entertainment guys, promotional merchandise. I was doing Grateful Dead bootleg hats. And then when you didn't have a.

[00:23:31.830] - Speaker 1
Store, it was never to the public.

[00:23:33.930] - Speaker 2
No, it wasn't to the public. It was through them. So then what happened was I started to try to get into the big merchandisers, like Hard Rock Cafe. And so when the hard Rock hotel had just opened, I was submitting, submitting, submitting, submitting. Trying to get my ideas and my designs in. And finally they grabbed one and they tested it, and effectively, in those days, there were unisex t shirts. So there's just small, medium, large, extra large. There was no women's t shirt. Didn't exist, but it existed in the market, in retail, but just not in promotional merchandising. So that was my ideas. I just was like, this is what everyone's wearing on the street. I'm going to bring this to just a very typical merchandising formula. And hard rock in those days, it was like they were selling just gobs of merchandise. I mean, it was enormous. And I was in my early twenty s. I submitted it, they called it the baby doll t shirt. And I got it in there, and within, kid you not 24, 48 hours, sold out. They placed another order, probably three times the volume of the first order.

[00:25:00.420] - Speaker 2
So then it just skyrocketed. And I remember because the group is sitting there going, they knew that this thing was going to be a multi million dollar t shirt. And they're thinking, I'm not gonna give this to a know. And Peter Morton, who owned the hard rock at the time, he was probably my biggest fan and supporter because he got it and he understood it. And he'd call me and he'd say, when are you going to get in here with some new. Oh, that's all I needed. That was my inspiration.

[00:25:39.320] - Speaker 1
So cool. Almost like a benefactor in a way.

[00:25:42.500] - Speaker 2
Literally, Peter opening the door for me to going into a real business. Know, I feel like I owe everything to that opportunity. It was the first moment that it was a real business. That was when I really tasted a real business.

[00:26:01.730] - Speaker 1
Interestingly, Peter's restaurant was a block away from your dad's.

[00:26:06.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Across the street.

[00:26:07.980] - Speaker 1
Across the street, down the block, yeah.

[00:26:09.610] - Speaker 2
So I grew up. We would go to Morton's all the time. And it's funny, because even though Peter and my father knew each other, Peter was running a business. He wasn't just going to do something, to do something. They were tough. They were very tough. And so he would ask me to bring in new products, of course, that's all I needed. And then I'd stay up for three days straight creating, designing. At those days, I had my own silkscreen machine. We were doing it like a garage business, basically. It was a garage business. And I'd create all this new stuff. And I had created this t shirt that was kind of based on the USA, kind of. At the time, Ralph Lauren had been doing a big USA push. And so I did this big HRhrc kind of with the american flag and kind of did this thing. And I walked in the door and I remember I was, like, literally falling asleep. Peter just grabs the bags, he opens them up, he starts laying them out all over the room and merchandising them on the file cabinets and everything. And he just says, I love it.

[00:27:18.020] - Speaker 2
I love it all. Put it in all the cafes, and then he leaves the room, and then I'm sitting there with a boardroom of ten employees, and they pretty much said, you know, we're not going to put them in all the cafes. Right? Meaning you're just too young for us to go that deep. Right. And slowly but surely. And I had a couple more allies in the room that were fantastic. So slowly but surely, I just kept proving myself, improving myself, delivering, delivering, delivering.

[00:27:54.490] - Speaker 1
They're used to working with huge.

[00:27:57.050] - Speaker 2
It was giant merchandising, if you remember, that did all the rock and roll. That was the big merchandiser.

[00:28:03.330] - Speaker 1
So a kid who's making them in his garage is different than who they're used to dealing with completely. And it would seem risky also, because how do they know you're going to be able to deliver?

[00:28:14.610] - Speaker 2
It makes total sense. Yeah, it makes total sense. They just didn't fully quite realize how serious I was and how reliable I was going to be and that I would put more into this than any one of those companies would ever even consider doing.

[00:28:32.770] - Speaker 1
They wouldn't have any way of knowing that.

[00:28:34.680] - Speaker 2
No, there's no way. So I'd approve myself.

[00:28:36.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:28:37.080] - Speaker 2
And the best thing is, then Southwest Airlines had two for one deals to Vegas, and we would stay up around the clock printing t shirts. Printing t shirts. Printing t shirts. We were printing them in house. I was running my own operation. I was buying even bigger. More printers. More printers. And we would put them in these boxes, throw them on southwest. I'd have a bunch of friends go with me. We would get them. We would just get a room. We'd finish tagging them all in the room. Have one of those, the cart that you put all your luggage on. We'd pile up all the boxes, we roll it down and deliver it to the store, and then we'd hang out in Vegas for the weekend and sort of celebrate.

[00:29:21.410] - Speaker 1
Such a great story. It's an amazing story.

[00:29:24.930] - Speaker 2
It was know at the end of the day, it was passion, and I was so driven. And all of this, it just started to come organically. And I remember when I was saying to my father and my mother and saying, I don't want to go to school anymore. This is crazy. This is before the hard rock. But I was paying my own bills. And they're like, but are you sure? And I just said, listen, when my friends come out of college, I need this head start. I don't want to be a kid who comes out of school and is sort of like, now what? What am I going to do? And then how do I discover it and what are the opportunities? I said, I'm on a roll. It's calling me. So then what started to happen is that grew from hard rock, and it grew into, I think, at one time I was doing planet Hollywood and I was doing hard rock, and I was doing big things with the movie studios and like Jurassic park, and they'd order 50,000 hats, and it was turning into this whole business. But what I started to realize is I'm not in control of my own Destiny, because a lot of them started taking things that I was creating and then just getting it made cheap, cheaper, cheap version and then just cutting me out of the deal.

[00:30:41.440] - Speaker 1
They might not have cared about the quality like you do.

[00:30:43.480] - Speaker 2
They didn't care about the quality. So they were then started going into the cheap route. But they were my ideas, my designs. So that's when I started to say, I've got to get more in control of this. I got to be in my own destiny here. Something's not going right here. I knew how to manufacture the point. I knew how to create things. So I had gotten under my belt a little bit, and so I ended up creating this whole little capsule off to the right of a bunch of different t shirt ideas. And so I found some local showroom, and they started putting it know Fred Siegel and all these little boutiques. They just started placing it in all these little boutiques, and it just started to take off now.

[00:31:38.420] - Speaker 1
But what were you making at that point?

[00:31:40.130] - Speaker 2
So at that point, ironically, it started.

[00:31:44.560] - Speaker 1
With women's, but also the women's t shirt was the first one that really blew up at the hard rock.

[00:31:50.190] - Speaker 2
Exactly. That's what I was going to say. So back then, the men's business was a sleepy business, and the women's business was just on fire. And so that's what seed got planted right away, was women's t shirts and a little more fashionable t shirts. Next thing I know, a business is born. It just happened.

[00:32:16.270] - Speaker 1
But those t shirts were blank t shirts.

[00:32:18.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, there was a lot of different style t shirts, but they were like, think of them a little bit more like they were not the basics. I hadn't gotten to the basics yet. They were a little more like a blouse. When I say a blouse, meaning all kinds of different necklines, boat necks and scoop necks and deep vnecks. So there was just tons of different necklines, but not the casualty as it is today. It was a little bit more like women's fashion sensibility, converting into jerseys.

[00:32:57.410] - Speaker 1
Understood.

[00:32:58.050] - Speaker 2
So not the basics.

[00:32:59.620] - Speaker 1
It wasn't a brand shirt, no logos. It was a plain shirt.

[00:33:03.710] - Speaker 2
Completely. The Jean business was exploding. The contemporary Jean business was exploding. And then do you remember which were.

[00:33:12.190] - Speaker 1
The brands that were hot in jeans at that time?

[00:33:14.350] - Speaker 2
Well, it started with Earl Jean. Yeah. I don't know if you remember.

[00:33:17.280] - Speaker 1
I do.

[00:33:17.710] - Speaker 2
Jean.

[00:33:18.210] - Speaker 1
They had a great Jean jacket.

[00:33:19.480] - Speaker 2
I remember, yeah. So Earl Jean was one of the really early ones. And so they were in our showroom also. So our sales team, they basically said, I'm going to put this t shirt with these jeans and I'm gonna sell this to everybody. And so we were just literally, that was the formula. Every account was buying an Earl Jean and a, you know, t shirt.

[00:33:44.130] - Speaker 1
How'd you decide to call it your.

[00:33:46.250] - Speaker 2
Know, that's one of my borderline biggest regrets that I would say to this day. It actually started as JP classics. That was the very first label was called JP Classics. It was almost because it was JP classics that everyone started referring to my name or something like that, like in the showroom or whatever it is. And then I almost feel like someone made a suggestion of, like, it'll seem more designer. Like, honestly, if I went back in time, I absolutely would have not associated my name. Well, I shouldn't say that because your name is on it. You feel a responsibility.

[00:34:28.080] - Speaker 1
It's true.

[00:34:29.830] - Speaker 2
Be a perfectionist to care that much. Because I take everything that goes on at the company, everything that goes on in a store, every single product, it's personal. It's personal and it sort of points back to me. So in a way I'd say it kicked my butt to maintain the integrity and to always have a personal connection to it. So I probably shouldn't say because maybe if it was a name or a brand, maybe I wouldn't have cared as much. It's funny because I was literally joking. I think I want to say yesterday is like you get tired of yourself because it's like people saying your name all day long at work. On one note, there's a complete separation between the person and the brand, but somehow it morphed into that. And in general, I'm a really super private person.

[00:35:33.960] - Speaker 1
I know, that's why I asked.

[00:35:35.340] - Speaker 2
No, it's funny. Yeah, but the funny thing is nobody knows who I am. So in a weird way, I'm completely remain, like, I get to live my life, I still live private life. The reality is they probably should have been a little more vocal and a little more let people understand the essence of where this is coming from. But I felt like what I was building and the environments, the spaces, the experience, and people were reinterpreting it back to me exactly the way I'd hoped it to become. So I wanted to do it my way. And my way was mixing the world that I grew up in in sunny California with this down to earth sort of. It doesn't matter who's who, what's what. As I grew up as a kid, there was a lot of some kids parents were big entertainment moguls and some kids parents. It was every walk of life, and it didn't matter. It just was about friends and a bond and being happy kids. And I wanted that. Especially, like, when I went to boarding school, the first thing out everyone's mouth is, do you know you're from California? And it realized there's such a culture and an identity of what California represented.

[00:37:04.190] - Speaker 2
But I wanted to elevate it. I wanted to put a little more sophistication and taste into the products that were coming out of California. That really stemmed from the umbrella of what I was educated under with my father.

[00:37:22.070] - Speaker 1
Makes perfect sense.

[00:37:22.980] - Speaker 2
And so I started mixing that sort of sensibility and blending it with the spirit of who I am and how I grew up. And when you put them together, that's what the brand became. And it didn't exist. It wasn't out there. And there's lots of elements. You're taking lots of pieces from where you grew up, but you're reinterpreting and you're reimagining, and you're setting a new standard, and you're setting a new path. And piece by piece, as we were talking about the evolution of then, when I did start to do my own brand and I started to go to these trade shows, I would watch what other brands, like Calvin Klein and Massimo and the storytelling that they were putting together. And I was like, I want to do this. This is what I want to do. And I also grew up in an umbrella under know. It started right under my know at know in Maxfield. And I started to make some chrome hearts hats. At one point, I'd go hang out. Richard had his first office, and I'd go deliver the boxes, and then I'd go hang out with him. And when he left that office, that became my first office.

[00:38:52.600] - Speaker 2
So there was, like, this special connection to what was kind of the world that I grew up in. And Richard used to, he had all these carpenters, and he had this insane, like, he just started building this incredible infrastructure, and he had a wood shop, and he was building furniture, and he was building out all his cabinets, and he was doing his jewelry, and then he was doing his clothing. And so he'd have his guys build me, build out my office and build out the desks. And we still, funny enough, the desk that he built for me close to 30 years ago is still sitting in my warehouse now. And they still actually work at the desk in the warehouse. It's literally the same desk.

[00:39:46.390] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[00:39:48.010] - Speaker 2
But Richard was a huge inspiration to me, because when they built their first store and they started to put all the pieces together in the environment, my father and Richard did this together. And I got another taste of this is what I want to do, the retail side. This is the retail. I want an environment. I want to build a thing. I want to tell this story. So I got a taste.

[00:40:20.070] - Speaker 1
It's different than having a t shirt in Fred Siegel's totally versus somebody coming into your world and seeing all your stuff. It's like a gallery.

[00:40:28.620] - Speaker 2
Totally. And when we would do the trade show booths, because that was the first step, I just became obsessed with that. So I would build these mini stores, and that's where I started to learn a little bit about building and visual merchandising and telling how pieces start to come together.

[00:40:45.010] - Speaker 1
How important were those shows?

[00:40:46.910] - Speaker 2
They were important at the beginning. Tell all your buyers were going to the shows. It was great exposure. And that's how ultimately, you would get to department stores, and they'd see you and they'd discover you. And the shows was an amazing learning experience because I had to learn every piece of the business. And so when you get to go to the shows and you're interfacing with all the buyers, and you're learning about buying, and you're learning about visual merchandising and how you have to sell the product. Our situation, at one point, we got so successful with certain items that that's all anybody kept buying. And our only outlet was a wholesale outlet. So I can't control it. And I went through a period many, many years ago where the sales started going down, and I couldn't get them to buy something new to get the volume back up. And I didn't know anything about finance in those days, so I didn't realize I had built an infrastructure. I had a bunch of overhead, and all of a sudden my sales are dipping, and I'm spending money. And I don't realize at some point it's going to start affecting my cash flow because I don't know anything about it.

[00:42:14.250] - Speaker 2
So I got myself into trouble, and I'll never forget it because people would always say, as a department store can put you out of business, and you're always like, why? I don't understand, what is it? But in a nutshell, it was a simple game of, you're guaranteeing margins for department stores. So you're effectively guaranteeing, they don't want excess inventory and they want to maintain a certain margin. So if they have to discount your merchandise at a certain point and erodes their margin, they're going to ask for that money back. And so you're like writing checks back while they want to send you back excess inventory for the willingness to take new inventory.

[00:43:07.150] - Speaker 1
I never knew any of this. That's really interesting.

[00:43:09.680] - Speaker 2
That was the game, and the game was this rotation.

[00:43:13.080] - Speaker 1
They have no risk, essentially.

[00:43:15.030] - Speaker 2
Essentially, it minimizes their risk. That's effectively the game that was played, or is played and went on for years and years and years, and if you don't manage it well, you will go out of business. And it's a dangerous game that you have to understand, because in your mind.

[00:43:33.360] - Speaker 1
The more they take, the more they can sell, right? But if they take a lot and they don't sell them, it's your problem.

[00:43:39.370] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[00:43:40.120] - Speaker 1
Understood.

[00:43:41.090] - Speaker 2
It's exactly what it is. And when you're kind of up and coming, you're like, how much can you even afford? And then what they do is they put it on a, they'd call it a chargeback, and they put it on a system. They would post it so all the creditors would have access to the system, and they would say, I'm going to charge you back 100 grand, or whatever it is. And if they saw that, because in those days, it's called a factor. And what the factor does is they advance you 85% of the invoice that you ship to the department store. They'll front load you money because you need it for working capital, and they will front load that money. So you keep buying merchandise, making merchandise, and paying your payroll. And I had somebody who read it on the system. It's like a bank is basically what it is, and they read it on this system, and they decided to cut off all my credit facility overnight. And I had already pre planned what it was supposed to be, and they just didn't do what it was supposed to be. And so I'm sitting there trying to figure out, now you have a word about payroll.

[00:44:58.670] - Speaker 2
And so effectively, what I went through was the brink of going out of business because of the way this game is being played. And I got connected with a new accountant. He walked in the door, he taught me all about budgets and projections, which.

[00:45:22.870] - Speaker 1
He'D never done before.

[00:45:23.940] - Speaker 2
Never done. And I spent the entire weekend mastering this thing. He gave me these parameters of what I was going to have to cut to get things in line. And so I just started going after all these variable expenses that I could get rid of, basically.

[00:45:42.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It wasn't what made the stuff you were making good.

[00:45:45.940] - Speaker 2
Right. Even I think trade shows might have fallen. There were some things that just. The math wasn't there. And so I was getting rid of it. Getting rid of, getting rid of, getting rid of it. So I basically got all the expenses down. I locked myself in a room, and I created what I always wanted created, which was the essential business, the core basics, because I had told in my hard rock days, I used to go to these guys that would make the t shirts for me, and I would go to. They were big distributors, and they have Haynes and this, and I would sit there and I go, do you understand that? If you just made your neckline just a little bit thinner, and if you just. The cotton was a little bit lighter and the shape was a little bit, you could sell zillions of these. They just get out of my office. Just get out of my office. They were amazing for me with the merchandise, because they wanted the volume of what was going on, but they had no interest in what I was actually doing. They just wanted to pump things through the system.

[00:46:53.430] - Speaker 2
And so I said to myself, there's a Haynes t shirt and there's a Jill Saunder t shirt, and there's nothing in between. And that's where I created the standard collection at the time we called it, which was the basic t shirt that lives with us to this day. And I repositioned everything, product lines, what the mission was going to be. I went back to the marketplace. I got all my expenses in line. You know what I had to do. My accountant helped me do this, but to stay in business, we had a tax refund that had not come yet. And he was able to sign over the tax refund to the bank to give me the credit facility that I needed to stay alive. And that move, that maneuver is what kept me in business.

[00:47:56.970] - Speaker 1
How many years in did this happen?

[00:47:59.450] - Speaker 2
It happened probably after I had started my own brand, three, four years in. But it was at that time when they were going so well that I couldn't get anybody to buy anything else. And you don't ever want to be that one hit wonder or that item, you don't want to be too hot. So from all those learning lessons, I started to pull back, and essentially I controlled the distribution, and I was controlling how much I would put out. And I was doing it in steps, like brick by brick. I wouldn't let it explode. I would say to a department store, I'm not going to give you more than this. That's all you're going to get from me. They'd blow out of it in 5 seconds or whatever, and then they'd want more. And I'd say, sorry.

[00:48:45.180] - Speaker 1
It changed the whole nature of the relationship totally.

[00:48:49.130] - Speaker 2
And I was going to build this again. My way contained the way I want. Everything was about now how I wanted to do it. And the amazing thing that I had learned from department stores, this was the greatest education that I got as a merchant, was how to be a merchant at the end of the day. Meaning inventory.

[00:49:14.200] - Speaker 1
Seeing what they did right and seeing what they did wrong.

[00:49:15.960] - Speaker 2
Well, no, it was a game of inventory management, control. So there's almost an art and science to buying and controlling your inventory. So there's these big spreadsheets and charts that basically you watch your performance and we call it, well, they're selling reports, but you're managing your sell through. So if I bought 100 units, did I sell 50? Did I sell 60? Did I sell 70? So you're managing all these components between your margin, your sell through, and we call it like kind of the turn, how fast, how many weeks of supply. So you become a supply chain expert a little bit, and you start to manage how you buy, how you manage the inventory, how you manage a margin.

[00:50:03.750] - Speaker 1
How long does it take to refill, how long do you have to wait to get more?

[00:50:07.480] - Speaker 2
I mean, it depends at which point in time, but in certain products, we set it up where we're already in an immediate position because we're carrying inventory to replenish. So there's a category that we replenish that's immediate because we're sitting on the stock. There's a category where we call it PFD. It's prepared for dye, where the garments are made, but they haven't been dyed into a color yet. Then we have a category where it's sitting in fabric. So we just need to cut, sew, make, and then we have a category that it's a longer lead time where you have to start at zero in order. So you have all these sections based upon.

[00:50:46.660] - Speaker 1
And when you introduce something new, how do you deal with it?

[00:50:49.760] - Speaker 2
Well, it depends what you think it's going to be right. So if we make a product that we believe is going to be foundational in a long term product, we will take the risk of already pre positioning ourselves, whether it's in fabric, before you sell one, before you sell one, that's the art and science. The art and science is sort of your gut and your instinct has got to play a role.

[00:51:16.400] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and experience.

[00:51:17.560] - Speaker 2
And experience, for sure.

[00:51:19.260] - Speaker 1
All of them.

[00:51:19.900] - Speaker 2
And then the math and how you manage it is the foundation and the tools. And so what has happened is, over many, many years, is my experiences of almost going out of business three or four years into this taught me everything about finance. I didn't just walk away from that like, I became obsessed with learning about finance, budgeting, I call it the keys to the kingdom, because with that visibility, you're not going to have the fear anymore, because you understand how to keep the levers where they need to be. And so that gives you confidence. So understanding finance gave me confidence. Understanding merchandising made me a strategic weapon. It made me a strategic weapon because if I could take the creative of understanding products and designs, but understanding it from a controlled environment of how to build programs and how to manage inventory and how to position your supply chain and connect it with your gut and your instinct and merchandising goes to even, like, I can go on and on and on, but there are high level strategies that can move the entire financial needle of the company as well. So I'll just give you an example.

[00:52:51.290] - Speaker 2
We call them aurs as like an average unit retail. So if you took everything you're selling, and then you looked at it and you said the price point was $200 average across all these categories, all these products, that's your reoccurring number that you're always watching and monitoring. But if you decided to, I'm going to start selling more cashmere, more higher price cashmere, more sweater jacket cashmere, and I'm going to inch up the price point, that's going to start rebalancing the averages, so that if your lower price point thing is pulling down the aur, these pushes are going to start bringing up the averages. So you can grow your business just by changing your mix and your assortments and your average price points. You don't even have to add another store, you don't have to do anything. You can just rethink the strategies of your price point strategies and so on and so forth. So effectively, I ended up learning all these different components, and then that just becomes the circle of how the whole system works. But when I went to open a store.

[00:54:13.970] - Speaker 1
Now, when was the first store?

[00:54:15.970] - Speaker 2
The first store now was probably pushing, I want to say 1819 years ago, probably close to that, maybe 18 years ago. First store was on Melrose, across the street from my father's store.

[00:54:28.870] - Speaker 1
Oh, cool.

[00:54:29.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it's still there.

[00:54:31.750] - Speaker 1
Cool.

[00:54:32.520] - Speaker 2
And when I built the first store, it was when I had to say, okay, you made products, but now you got to piece this whole thing together. What does this brand look like? What are your hang tags? What is your logo? What is your labels? What is your merchandising? What are your mannequins? Your forms, your hangers, your fixtures? And my whole attitude was, I don't want to look like a retail store. I want it to be like a home. I want every store we do to be a special environment. I want it to be experiential. And in those days, most retail was very retail. It was, here's a cookie cutter formula, and how do we build 100 of these as fast as you can? And I just sort of was more interested in the idea of probably because I was obsessed with architecture. I just want to do different things every time I was doing it and just enjoy.

[00:55:29.300] - Speaker 1
You want to make it a place that you'd want to hang out in. Was that part of it?

[00:55:32.940] - Speaker 2
That was the idea. I wanted it to feel like home to you. I wanted you to be inspired. I wanted you to feel like, I want my house to feel like this. And I'm just so comfortable that I'm here for an extra 2 hours, or I don't even want to leave. When we opened the second Malibu store, meaning not the original one, but the bigger one now, and we created that whole outdoor deck. It's funny because I'm paying rent for that outdoor deck because it was supposed to be inside space, but I designed the building and took the square footage and made the deck. So I have to pay rent, like, as if it was enclosed. But esthetically, I wanted it to be this experience. And it was amazing the way people, overnight, they'd come and they just sit there and lay out on the deck. They'd bring their dogs. A dog would be on one shades, and they'd be on the other shades. We would serve them a drink, and they'd hang out, enjoy themselves, and just, that's what I wanted. And so opening store after store, it allowed me to just keep exploring new ideas, new thoughts, new experiences.

[00:56:43.980] - Speaker 2
But then I had sort of graduated to saying, okay, it's such about the home. I wanted to take my customer through a journey into, now let's get serious. Because we had so many people that just were like, can you do my home? Or I want my home to look like our store? And they'd come in with their contractors and look at, I've done it myself. And so then we started to go into all the home furnishings, and we started going into blankets and furniture.

[00:57:23.780] - Speaker 1
How many stores are there now?

[00:57:25.610] - Speaker 2
I think there's somewhere between 60 to 70 stores.

[00:57:29.850] - Speaker 1
Wow. Mostly in the US.

[00:57:32.300] - Speaker 2
A lot in the US. The international stores are just in Japan, Canada, and London and Mexico. And what's been amazing, too, is that even though we've built it heavily in the US, there's been such an international sort of draw as they're coming through the US and education to the brand, that we're not starting at zero. When we show up in different spots around the world.

[00:57:59.290] - Speaker 1
How much is the online part of.

[00:58:01.070] - Speaker 2
The business, the online piece of the business? I want to say it's 15% to 20% of the business, which is still a very small percentage of most people's business. And it's exploded for us. So we had a lot of catching up to do because we had built brick and mortar in a big way. And then ecommerce, so Covid really expedited it for us. And now it's a major. Now the whole game has changed. The game is now all consumer centric, all digital centric, all marketing centric. My only marketing to date was building stores, my environments. There was no messaging, there was no big ad, no advertising, there was none of that. It was just this grassroots business that organically. But now that you're in a digital space and with the world of social and the world of building this ecommerce business, the game has completely changed. And so I'm actually flip flopping our entire process so that I'm now about telling stories. It's almost like when you have stores and environments, you can get away with a lot because you're making products and you're putting in your environments, you have a team there that can communicate.

[00:59:25.940] - Speaker 1
The physical experience provides a lot of the story.

[00:59:29.850] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[00:59:30.650] - Speaker 1
And now online, you don't get that.

[00:59:32.690] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And we were not very good at it. And now it's time. And we've taken the strength of our team that have been with us for years, and we're all moving over to a digital position and marketing position, and we flip flop the process so that instead of looking at everything from a selling and a reactionary perspective to dictate what we were going to develop on the next cycle. We now start the story and the marketing first, meaning the analytics are already there. We know when we sell shorts, we know when we sell sweaters, we know when we sell jackets. We know what we need to talk about, when we need to talk about it. So it's now more focused on how do you tell your story?

[01:00:27.280] - Speaker 1
Is the story what differentiates your sweater from someone else's?

[01:00:32.320] - Speaker 2
No, I think that the story is about the brand. So what we're doing is it's all a sense of place and environment. It starts as this California brand. And in this California brand, you have all kinds of different experiences. Whether you're in Malibu or you're in LA, or you're in Montecito, or you're in mammoth, or you're in the desert, in Joshua Tree, or you're in Palm Springs.

[01:00:59.300] - Speaker 1
You had a t shirt with all the names on.

[01:01:01.080] - Speaker 2
I loved that t shirt.

[01:01:02.700] - Speaker 1
It's such a cool t shirt.

[01:01:04.700] - Speaker 2
That actually became almost like a branded t shirt to us. Wow. It was the essence of telling the California story. And we're starting to shape products around a sense of place and a sense of environment so that our stories can get clearer. Because you have to take a whole internal operation and get everybody on a page. Because the same people who are making clothing are not making bags and shoes, and the same people doing that are not making surfboards and the same people, you got to pull a lot of pieces together to tell one simplistic story. So if the story is the foundation, then they all can work towards the story instead of everybody on their own page and nothing comes together. Right. So I've been playing the glue of the vision of the story and this foundation that we're sort of putting into play. But this whole thing is an ecosystem. It's an ecosystem that these experiential destinations and locations also are surrounded with products. Not in a commercial way, in a very.

[01:02:15.250] - Speaker 1
No, you get to live in the place. And in the same way that if you went to a friend's house and he has a really comfy sofa.

[01:02:21.530] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:02:21.970] - Speaker 1
And you say, I'd like this in my house, where'd you get it? It's the same idea.

[01:02:25.800] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And so you have your product piece of the business, which it was, apparel and fashion, shoes and accessories and all that. And then you have home furnishings and the interiors. And then you get these experiential destinations and locations that are filled with all the products. And so effectively, it's a new form of retail for us because it's a showroom. It's a way to experience and live in that environment. And the intention is it just keeps sort of feeding the ecosystem.

[01:03:00.160] - Speaker 1
Plan on doing more of those.

[01:03:01.680] - Speaker 2
We do plan on doing more of those. And right now it's actually kind of graduating to a much larger community hotel like experience. Meaning all of them operate like a hotel right now anyways. It's full kind of service and experience end to end. But now when you grow it to a community, it's at the scale of a hotel. And then we're sort of venturing into that channel.

[01:03:29.160] - Speaker 1
And do you plan on doing them all over the world or would you like to?

[01:03:32.470] - Speaker 2
In fact, now it's reversing itself. Now we have the possibilities of when we enter into a market, we're going to enter with everything at one shot. Instead of like the bit by bit by bit, you get the full immersive experience. So we're going to build the hotel with the retail component, both home furnishings and apparel and all the experiential. So for us, the game has changed because we're basically getting to do everything at once at the same time, which is great.

[01:04:13.290] - Speaker 1
Efficient.

[01:04:13.920] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly.

[01:04:14.890] - Speaker 1
Brand wise, who else is in the space? It's so specific what you do.

[01:04:19.100] - Speaker 2
It's funny because that's kind of the nice thing. I think there are people competing in certain product categories, but when you pull the brand together, it sort of sits a little bit on its own island. A little bit. I think that was always the plan. That was always the hope. So it's funny because I was just with somebody the other day and they just started saying. They're saying something similar to what you just said. I can't think of what.

[01:04:51.950] - Speaker 1
What do you compare it to?

[01:04:53.060] - Speaker 2
There is. Yeah, you have to chop it up to compare it. You have to say, oh, this person makes t shirts. Or this, like, if you take a brand like a Brunello Cuccinelli as an example, which has built an amazing business, and there was always people who would talk about some interesting similarities, but we come from different worlds and the experience.

[01:05:17.390] - Speaker 1
Couldn'T be more different.

[01:05:18.810] - Speaker 2
Right, exactly.

[01:05:20.620] - Speaker 1
And they say different things, but that's.

[01:05:23.360] - Speaker 2
What I had always hoped. I wanted them to feel like it was their brand, it was part of their life, it's part of their memories. Because 25 years ago, the world was a very different place. And so the world has become incredibly casual compared to where it was. I mean, obviously Covid knocked that off the charts even before that, but even before that.

[01:05:49.850] - Speaker 1
True.

[01:05:50.170] - Speaker 2
Like, when I would go to Tokyo. It used to be very conservative, and you'd always see everyone in suits and stuff. Now you can kind of walk around, or even years ago, you could identify neighborhoods, and you can pick up on personalities, and you could look at it by the way that they're dressed or do they have a stroller and do they have kids? And you'll be like, oh, this is like Brentwood. I can see families versus young kids versus young professionals. I'm very fortunate and grateful to have been there at the right time where it kind of wasn't on the map. And so we were able to build, like, sort of a brand that people now can rely on. The brand and the quality and the consistency versus just think of it as the category or the item.

[01:06:48.260] - Speaker 1
But I don't think of anything else in the category. There's street wear, which it's not right, and then there's Gucci, which it's not right.

[01:06:56.280] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:06:56.710] - Speaker 1
It's a different thing.

[01:06:58.110] - Speaker 2
Well, you know what's funny is after Covid, you've got all the. I don't even say after Covid, that's not even the right thing. Let's just say two years ago, a year ago, everyone's just pounding collaborations, pounding street wear, novelty, loud, loud, loud. And then that kind of the tides change. And then all of a sudden, they say, quiet luxury. They start using these buzwords, and everyone says, it's about quiet luxury. And then brands start coming in, it's about quiet luxury. And I'm just sitting there laughing, going, hello. I've been doing quiet luxury for 30 years. That is what we are now. What I have witnessed over years is you're watching a lot of the luxury brands casualize. So they themselves have trying to become more and more and more casual. But we still sit in this world that is approachable, obtainable, makes you feel good. And it's funny because while I've been building this brand for all these years, I go to work every day. I live in a uniform. I basically don't change very much. I'm kind of probably the most boring of the whole equation. And you're just going into comfort, and you're just going there to do your work, do your work, do your work.

[01:08:34.880] - Speaker 2
And yesterday, I think it was yesterday, I wore a new t shirt. I wore a colored t shirt and a pair of white pants. And everybody in the house kind of goes, whoa. Everybody commented, whoa, you look nice today. And then everybody at work, wow, where are you coming? And I just laughing because I was just saying at the end of the day, all I did was change the color. It was the same uniform I wear every single day. It's just I literally put on a pair of a white pair of pants instead of my usual earthy whatever, and then instead of a white t shirt, I put in an actual color. And then I even myself was saying I'm pretty pathetic.

[01:09:27.580] - Speaker 1
You talk about comfort, and I think that's a big key. Street wear isn't designed necessarily to be comfortable. It has a different purpose. Gucci isn't designed to be comfortable. It's got a different purpose.

[01:09:39.960] - Speaker 2
Right.

[01:09:40.690] - Speaker 1
I feel like your clothing is much more for the benefit of the wearer, not the perception from the outside.

[01:09:49.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I would say for sure. I think it's trying to build things that last, and I think that you have to try to. My biggest thing is trying to get all the kinks out that are the difference between, do I want this or do I not want this? Does it annoy me or does it not annoy me? Is it comfortable? Is it uncomfortable? But sometimes it's the subtlest things. It's your pocket bag. Like, I sit there and I hammer when they do pocket bags that are too short and your keys fall out of your pocket, it's driving me bananas, and it's like, you got to get the functionality just right, because if you get annoyed by that, my whole thing is you can't agitate anybody. You can't annoy them.

[01:10:37.680] - Speaker 1
You don't want them thinking about it.

[01:10:39.120] - Speaker 2
You can't have them thinking about that. They can't be repeating that. It has to be the opposite. They have to just sit there and love it and keep wanting more. So those little things are the things you have to keep sort of ironing out. And when you do become bigger and you're creating more, it gets a little more difficult to be so attention to detail on everything you're doing. However, I still always reel it back in and say, less is more. Engineer it to last. And let's spend the time and energy on making this great. Not processing, not just getting it out the door, not just another season. Look at what performs, look what lives with us forever. We have shirts that have been with us for 20 years. That's where the energy goes. And so you have to remind people. You remind people because you're running a business and you're running a process and you're running a machine.

[01:11:42.280] - Speaker 1
Tell me from the beginning of an idea, do you have the idea or does someone else have the idea?

[01:11:46.710] - Speaker 2
It's a combination of both.

[01:11:48.710] - Speaker 1
Do you have people pitch you ideas.

[01:11:50.820] - Speaker 2
Well, when it comes to making garments, I spend a lot of time on making sure the boat is heading in the direction that I want it to head. So I spend my time thinking about everything. Always everything. My brain goes to literally everything at once. It does not think about just the one specific thing. It thinks about the story, the environment, the space, the visual. It thinks about the business. It thinks about how we're going to approach this. Then I start honing in on the edit and the curation of it, which also involves adjustments and changes and also, let's just say, holes that don't exist where you're leading the process as a merchant, saying, we need to be doing this and we need to be working on this and we need to be doing more this. And then I just go into idea mode. And then I go into idea mode of, how do you take something you love and how do you play with different fabrics and what are the different possibilities of the different fabrics? Or if I am with a garment, I'm sitting there saying, then you start going into what you like and you don't like.

[01:13:09.920] - Speaker 2
The most important thing is to surround yourself with a phenomenal team.

[01:13:14.810] - Speaker 1
How do you find the team?

[01:13:16.580] - Speaker 2
Some of my team has been with me for years and years and years, and we know each other like back of our hand. Some of the team, as you explore, it's difficult. What I would tell you is, coming from Los Angeles, there's pros and cons. The pro is, I always wanted to be on my own island, and I'm officially on my own island. And I had this canvas to work from. The con is I'm not in the network of where a lot of the best talent pools and resources are.

[01:13:49.580] - Speaker 1
This is not the center of the fashion world.

[01:13:51.890] - Speaker 2
No, it's not the center of the fashion. There's needles in haystack around here, but it's definitely not the center of the fashion world. Which was funny, because every time I've seen years ago they would try to bring a fashion, like, do a fashion week in LA, and I would just be like, you gotta be kidding. Like, why would you ever try to compete with what's going on in Europe, let alone New York? But you're just like, this is ridiculous. This is going to make us look silly. Which I think they have discovered over time, is like, you're like, we're the source of inspiration. We're the source of experience. You miss the lifestyle aspect of what's going on here. Not that we need a formula that is feeding like, a diluted version of what the most cutting edge creators in the world are doing. Like, are you kidding me? What do we want to look at that for? But they're inspired by us. So embrace that. Be who you are.

[01:14:56.070] - Speaker 1
Do you ever look at trends of what else is going on in the world, or does that not apply in the big picture?

[01:15:03.300] - Speaker 2
Not really. We were never following a trend, like, ever. Like, if certain tops were in or whatever kind of. In the heyday, my attitude was like, I'm just going to become that because everyone's wearing it. There are moments where you can create your own interpretation of something that's in at the moment. So take, for example, like a Birkenstock. The interesting, funny thing is that obviously, Birkenstock's been around for a long, long time. Obviously going to the Grateful Dead. I've seen my share of Birkenstock, but I don't know how many years ago it was. I was in the mood. This is way before the craze of the reinvention of the Birkenstock, but I was in the mood. I thought with our California sensibility and our attitude, it was time to curate and put that together, the product. So we actually started buying just straight up Birkin stocks. And it looked amazing. It looked amazing because we were sort of modernizing the look. It was sort of the way we could mix it with our products. Just sort of looked like you were not in the parking lot at the Grateful Dead. And then we did a little collaboration.

[01:16:29.980] - Speaker 2
It wasn't necessarily easy, but just a little minor collaboration. And then it became a craze. When I say a craze, I mean the Birkenstock is no longer the Birkenstock. It's the crew neck, meaning it's a staple silhouete. Everybody has an interpretation of the silhouette, and Birkenstock themselves just exploded. But every designer was doing an interpretation of a Birkenstock, and it was just madness and the craze. And so that was one of those where we caught the wave before the wave, and we were actually just interacting with Birkenstock. But that's an interesting one because that one actually then became actually a shape and a pattern, and now it's become a staple. And now it's become. Everybody has that staple reinterpreted in some shape or form. And effectively everybody kind of wins because Birkenstock just exploded as well.

[01:17:38.890] - Speaker 1
But it happened at one time with Ug boots, too. Do you remember when UG boots sort of became the thing that's right.

[01:17:44.410] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It's kind of like some of those guys are so powerful with what their creation that it became effectively a staple. But I look at the wave to figure out what wave I want to catch. That's not the wave.

[01:18:03.960] - Speaker 1
Understood.

[01:18:04.860] - Speaker 2
So it tells me where the direction is going to go and where I have to place myself.

[01:18:10.580] - Speaker 1
You're doing alternative programming?

[01:18:12.750] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. Instinctually, that's more intriguing to me. And it's always about repositioning and saying, well, if it's going there, it's definitely going to come back here. So I'm going to place myself over here. But at the end of the day, the majority of what we are is about foundational engineering to last. And we want to run a business that's more on a consistent basis. We don't want peaks and valleys and we're not really.

[01:18:42.620] - Speaker 1
You don't want to be the hot thing?

[01:18:44.240] - Speaker 2
I never want to be too hot. Never. I want to be loved. Yes, but never too hot. And there's always a time to wake up and reinvent yourself and reposition yourself and evolve. And by the way, I learned these things very early on, and maybe those are the things that I became allergic to because they scared the crap out of me. And I got that taste of how quickly something can go south. And so I was always more about controlled and steady. And the benefit is it's resulted in a brick by brick, methodically built company. Probably could be two or three times as big as it is now. But I'm okay going at a controlled pace. There's a faster pace, but you give.

[01:19:44.160] - Speaker 1
Up something to get the faster pace.

[01:19:46.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, too fast. Too fast. I can't say I haven't been slow, but I've also spent a lot of time and energy into these other areas to set the tone of what the next 20 years can be. So that took a lot of time, but now we're bringing it back and saying, we want a store in Paris, we're opening a store in Dubai, we're opening a store in Abu Dhabi. Great. We want to venture around the world. And it's been really fun again to travel and to get out there and say, wow, I can't believe we're not even here. But my version of being there is, how do I localize? How do I understand where we're going? How do I understand how we can collaborate with where we're going versus just sort of show up? The same thing? The same thing. The same thing. It just, for me, becomes a new canvas to play with.

[01:20:48.890] - Speaker 1
How difficult is it to get the manufacturing part right?

[01:20:52.440] - Speaker 2
The manufacturing part, that's all about experience, and that's all about resources, and that's all know. So at the beginning, you're looking at the manufacturer. I would sit there in my jeep, and I'd be moving boxes from downtown LA to this place. I'd stay up all night in the dye facilities, making sure the colors are exactly they were supposed to be. I mean, I was neurotic. Like when the inside of the garment dyed a different color than the outside, I'd sit there with a blow dryer. I was out of my mind because I was a perfectionist, because I felt like, you get one shot at this, and I have this thing where if I said I was going to do something, I better do it exactly the way I said I was going to do it. I just care too much. It's good and bad. That's what consumes me. So over the years, we definitely had moments where you're like, okay, we have a little issues over here, or whatever, but that really comes down to resources and who you're working with. Because if you start finding the right resources and the right manufacturer, because we learned how to manufacture, there's effectively, like, two versions for the types of stuff that we do.

[01:22:12.960] - Speaker 2
You can actually cut, sew, and make the garment. Where you're buying the fabrics, you're sending it to one person to cut it. Another person's sewing it, another person's dyeing it, another person's finishing it. It's a lot of steps. And then the other version is you're working with a manufacturer who's kind of just taking control and handing you a finished product. And those tend to be a lot easier. However, there's something about the speed of what you can do and the flexibility, because those things have minimums, and they have this and they have that. And when you can just cut, sew, and make your garments, you can work around some of those restrictions very easily. That's a nice thing. Is like, I guess, by doing everything yourself, is that how you do it? We do both. We do both. But I mean, by my education, by learning and doing everything myself. The beauty of that is now when I'm interacting with any single department, I can speak to it. I understand what it is.

[01:23:24.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you know what you're talking about. You've done all the steps.

[01:23:27.780] - Speaker 2
Yes. The only step, I would say is, when it comes to it and technology, forget it. That's not my cup of tea. So I have an awesome group of guys that deal with that. But when it comes to software that's related to process in operating, I know, I understand that up and down and left and right. That's a huge piece of how you're going to operate.

[01:23:50.420] - Speaker 1
Who were the designers that were inspirational to you at any point?

[01:23:55.700] - Speaker 2
For me, the heyday, the greatest moment in time was I was obsessed with helmet Lang. Obviously the original helmet Lang, when he was doing his own brand, Jill Saunder. When Jill Saunder was running her own, know Margiela, when Margiela was running his brand. Those are probably my three all times, but always inspired by Yogi. Y three, but really yogi. And over the years, Phoebe Philo is brilliant. And I remember one of the first suits my dad had custom made for me with a tailor upstairs from the shop was like mirroring an Armani suit for a four year old. There's photos of me in the suit, but I would say those are probably never Ralph. Oh, well, no, but Ralph, he's God to me in the sense of storytelling and the environment and the lifestyle. When you talk about the term lifestyle and you pull the pieces together, there is no one better than Ralph. No one better than Ralph. I'm so enamored by the stories that he's doing and the environments and the merchandising and the visual merchandising and the different types of products and the range that he's doing that I almost don't even focus on the products because I'm so into.

[01:25:39.680] - Speaker 2
How could anybody dream this up?

[01:25:42.180] - Speaker 1
There's also so many products, it's hard to even know where to start.

[01:25:45.970] - Speaker 2
That's right. It's like endless. It's endless. It's funny because I would say the different references and sources of inspiration are for different reasons and different, you know, almost allows me to be me in the sense that he's very east coast and he has a very strong sensibility coming from sort of an east coast lifestyle that allows me to understand. I'm so west coast and I need to focus on what I know so well and what that sensibility is and those stories that I can tell and those life experiences that I can tell. So it's an incredible reference of teaching me how to build something that represents versus. You watch people sit there and tell stories and you're just like, there's no authenticity. So that's what I am so blessed by, is that everything that I'm doing, it just feels like it's me. All real.

[01:26:59.120] - Speaker 1
In your real life story, it makes.

[01:27:02.400] - Speaker 2
It easier because I've lived it and experienced it. I'm not just like pretending and making up this brand new story over here. I've been doing it for years and years and years. And that makes it fun to me because you can really be yourself.

[01:27:16.030] - Speaker 1
How important is distribution?

[01:27:18.800] - Speaker 2
Distribution is always important for us today we're primarily vertical. So it's all our own stores.

[01:27:26.200] - Speaker 1
Your own stores online and that's it.

[01:27:29.240] - Speaker 2
Right.

[01:27:30.980] - Speaker 1
Can't buy it anywhere else.

[01:27:32.470] - Speaker 2
Well, no, you can on a very small scale. We sell to some smaller boutiques still. What I preserved is some of the smaller boutiques, as in that's where we came from and that's where we started. And I've sort of always continued to do business with smaller boutiques. When it comes to department stores, we only interact with Bloomingdale's because we control our own concession.

[01:28:02.550] - Speaker 1
I see.

[01:28:03.110] - Speaker 2
So they're giving us the freedom to be us.

[01:28:07.840] - Speaker 1
And does it just get you into more places? Because I'm thinking what you're making is so beautiful and the stores are so great. And if I lived in a place where there wasn't one, I'd feel bad.

[01:28:18.360] - Speaker 2
Right.

[01:28:19.380] - Speaker 1
I haven't experienced the online enough to know that would motivate me to buy 100%.

[01:28:25.410] - Speaker 2
And that's something we're working on heavily, is because you'd say, like, why would I buy this versus this even within my own brand? Why am I buying this t shirt versus this t shirt? So we've been working on this whole major 3.0 site that hopefully is going to tell a much stronger story through a digital world, the way we have in our brick and mortar. But you're exactly right. And that's where boutiques and sort of being in areas and locations that are not accessible or we don't have stores because there's a lot of them still is very valid. And the introduction to those customers and all that, and that's why we've kind of maintained the boutique attitude. It's really about the whole business in itself is intended to feel boutique. So even if we scale it, if.

[01:29:17.900] - Speaker 1
You could have your stuff in whatever today's Max field is, in a place where there's no James purse store, seems.

[01:29:27.000] - Speaker 2
Like a good, like, like a boutique store. Yeah, it is. It is a very good thing. At the end of the day, just those seeds that are being planted and those people's experiences for the first time and engaging with the company and the brand is huge. So it is, it's hard internally to run different types of businesses at the same time because they're very different, understood so the whole process is different. Like, when we develop and produce for our stores, we just can stick to a calendar because you can just say, I'll make x amount go right when it's wholesale. You go through this selling period, and it messes up the calendar. Understood.

[01:30:11.250] - Speaker 1
Everything takes longer.

[01:30:12.730] - Speaker 2
Everything gets longer. You could project shit. It could create exposure, or you have to minimize it. So you can't offer all the same amounts of product. So it's complicated. So that's a little bit of the challenge.

[01:30:25.510] - Speaker 1
Well, it just tells me that there's so much potential for the brand to grow. It's the type of timeless clothing that could work everywhere. All over the world.

[01:30:36.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. It's true. Honestly, as I've been traveling, my eyes just keep opening up because I'm like, I can't even believe we're not here. And I can't believe we're not here.

[01:30:46.580] - Speaker 1
I can't believe it's a big world.

[01:30:48.230] - Speaker 2
It's a big world. And that's our next step, is now focusing on the international aspect of the business. There's not a lot to figure out. It's like time. It just needs to happen. We got to execute. And so we're refocusing on that game plan. But in the same breath, it's like you're going to different places around the world. And the world is so different today that there are opportunities to embrace all these different places that you're going to and find new methods of creating, manufacturing, or localizing, and being open to new ideas that even make sense, not just a style perspective. But I'm sort of at this age now where I want to listen and hear what a young generation is thinking. And, yeah, I can sit here and say, like, I don't know what they're thinking about, or I can listen and learn from where their heart is and where their thoughts are. And raising two boys, it's been fascinating, because I'll tell you this, I wasn't as into fashion as my kids are. It's just a different world because they're being exposed to this content and being influenced of where are this and where are that?

[01:32:23.860] - Speaker 2
And da da da da da. And it's funny because they're both on the same campus. So the older one just started at Malibu High because he had left for a bit, and he's come mean. He was going to school over the hill, and then he came back, and day one of dropping him off at school, when I pulled in and I looked at this scene, I mean, it was fast times at Ridgemont High. I mean, it was the coolest. It was fantastic. These kids, the attitude, the styling, they're all friends from nothing. They've all grown up together, which to me, is the most important thing in the world. It's that bond for life. But their interest. Like, they were all hanging out in one area, one zone, and you're just immediately looking at the styling that's going on. And when I was in high school, it was absolutely not like this. And, of course, as you know, in Malibu, it's got a very retro sort of sensibility. And these kids are pulling their striped socks all the way up. And it's got this sort of skater. It's like a hybrid of skate, surf, street wear, all combined.

[01:33:36.220] - Speaker 2
But they're all on it. All of them. I still want to say, in a down to earth way, not in a. You have this and I have that. These kids are trading stuff, which I actually love, because they have no concept of what anything costs. One kid's got this, and it costs this. The other kid, it doesn't matter. They start trading sweatshirts. Yeah, what's cool? So they start trading things with each other, and I think that's fantastic. You get sick of something, and then they start trading. But I'm blown away by the young generation and their interest in style. It is nothing like the way I grew up. Meaning, yes, I had a father who had it, but my friends in us was like, forget it. Go back and look at the photos. There was no but. You're going to go back and look at these kids'photos, and you're going to say, like, wow, they represented a time period. And I say fast times of Ridgemont High, because really, it's that on point. But it's got a little bit of, obviously, update and a twist. So I'm very open. I love to learn. I love to be educated.

[01:34:51.260] - Speaker 2
I love to be shown something new. What, you know, great. You've experienced it, you've learned it. But it's not about sitting there and just honing in on what you know. I don't feel alive unless somebody's teaching me something.

[01:35:05.710] - Speaker 1
So much fun to learn new stuff.

[01:35:07.560] - Speaker 2
So much fun.

[01:35:08.430] - Speaker 1
The best.

[01:35:09.880] - Speaker 2
It's been interesting since COVID where it's hard to get people back to the office. But I'll tell you, when you're in an empty space or you're just kind of on your own or whatever, I just don't do well with that. When I have energy surrounding me and I have groups of people surrounding me, and we're bouncing ideas off of each other. I'm born again. It's just like you're alive. And literally, I notice it to the day because I know which days everybody's in the office, and I know which days get very light days. And without your team and without, it's everything. It's the passion, it's the ideas. It's the fun of creating things. It's the sheer energy, personalities, humor.

[01:36:00.340] - Speaker 1
Describe the environment where you meet with your team.

[01:36:03.580] - Speaker 2
Well, we have two different environments. So we have one facility in the marina, kind of near Venice area. And then we have an environment down in Downey, past downtown, which is sort of the operations facility, where a lot of tech and the product development takes place. When we're in the marina office, it's a very kind of minimalist loft environment. Very warm wood bow truss ceilings with sort of white cube objects, kind of creating a dramatic corridor down the center. When we kind of walk into the. What I've been doing is sort of converting it to trying to. This whole marketing piece that never existed in the business is a new piece that I'm building, which is now all about renderings and digital communication and campaigns and even designing products digitally so that you can start to envision what these things look like and what the stories are going to look like. So it's transformed there to being much more of an environment of beautiful renderings and storytelling. So I like when I'm surrounded by my visual teams and the merchant teams and the marketing teams and graphic design teams, when we're all in there and we're dreaming it up and we're talking it out, I feel like we're making progress.

[01:37:52.320] - Speaker 2
I feel like we're creating structure. We're seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, and we're bouncing ideas off, and I feel alive. I grew up being in these factories. Like, if I walk into the warehouse or if I walk into a sample room, I come alive, because it just reminds me. It's just like, that's where stuff happens. That's where it's made, that's where it's created, that's where you get. My brain starts thinking about. And every time I go into any place, how can I do it better? How can I do it better? How can I do it better? The one thing I love about having my own business is that you could spend a lot of time in a creative situation. But everything gets exhausting. I refresh by then going into a.

[01:38:41.370] - Speaker 1
Business, it's like a whole new life. Complete palate cleanser and then when you come back to the creative side, it's like, oh, this is fun.

[01:38:49.780] - Speaker 2
Totally. There are moments, too when people creatively, I'm sure I'd be curious how you deal with this because it doesn't always hit you over the head. Somebody comes in, you like this, this or this and I sit there and go, I'm kind of in my brain going, I don't really like any of them, but I have to think about this. I can't answer why right now and then I have to walk away and I have to think about it and then I have to sort of figure out, is there anything from it? Do I have to start from scratch or is there something I'm going to pull from it? It's amazing to me how the littlest thing can give you the biggest idea.

[01:39:34.620] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[01:39:35.600] - Speaker 2
It's crazy.

[01:39:36.570] - Speaker 1
It's miraculous.

[01:39:37.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's true.

[01:39:39.230] - Speaker 1
And it can be a comment someone makes.

[01:39:42.020] - Speaker 2
Totally.

[01:39:42.740] - Speaker 1
It could be noticing a sign somewhere and you change everything in your life.

[01:39:48.910] - Speaker 2
Totally. The thing is, I wish I actually, I mean, maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I'm such an idea person that you forget your ideas.

[01:40:00.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:40:01.080] - Speaker 2
You're rambling so many ideas and then sometimes they come back full circle and then sometimes they vanish.

[01:40:11.180] - Speaker 1
I try to make notes and sometimes I'll make a note and it'll be too vague and then I come back to it later and I read the note and I have no idea what it is.

[01:40:19.070] - Speaker 2
I do the exact same thing.

[01:40:20.350] - Speaker 1
No idea what it means.

[01:40:21.160] - Speaker 2
No idea what it means. It's so funny because I just like a few days ago got this, there's this digital pad. I got to send this to you. But there's this digital pad that's like this notetaking pad. It's all digital. But it's simple enough because I have 5000 pieces of paper and I end up with all these pieces of paper and I renote the same thing and I end up with duplicate notes and duplicate, and I ended up with it all over the place. I'm not going to sit there and type everything. So I want to make my notes. Essentially, it's kind of infinite at the end of the day.

[01:40:52.020] - Speaker 1
It sounds right.

[01:40:52.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And you just can sort of keep going. But I joke all the time because I have the exact same thing. I have no idea. Read my note again. First of all, half the time I can't even read my own writing. The other half the time I can't remember what planet, what I was even thinking or what I was trying to say. And then there's the occasional, like, I got it. I remember well, when I listen to you, when you talk about the creative process, and you have such an incredible way of articulating a very complicated process. And to me, I'm bouncing around it's thoughts and ideas, and it's interesting how I'm becoming more aware. If you took before, COVID I worked around the clock for so many years and just grinded and grinded and grinded. But I always felt like I just loved what I was doing, and I just loved that energy around me. I loved being creative. I loved being passionate about everything that I was working on, so it didn't really feel like work. Of course, there's lots of headaches, and that's probably my least favorite part of the equation. Then Covid and I learned to sort of slow down, and then that became kind of special a little bit.

[01:42:26.370] - Speaker 2
You open your eyes, you slow down. But then I realize if there is a lack of energy surrounding me and there's a lack of similar desires to create a result, it's almost depressing, because you've thrived on passion for so many years that nothing should feel like it's work or nothing should feel like you don't like what you're doing. But what's crazy is how fast that switch goes on, that you put something exciting in front of me or just the beginnings of it's on. It's so weird. It's like, it's just. It's on. It's like I could be so upset, frustrated and pissed off and agitated and this and that, and all of a sudden, there's a shoe right in front of me, and I can taste the progress of what I wanted to have happen. And then all of a sudden, you're, like, thinking of 50 versions of something, and it's on. And it's really hard. When you thrive on passion and you go, and you go and go. To get yourself to slow down is confusing because you just don't even know what that means.

[01:43:56.560] - Speaker 1
What am I here for?

[01:43:57.870] - Speaker 2
What am I here for? And then when you're too slow, it can be depressing because you're sort of, where's the energy now? I don't even mean it's just the energy, the thing that fulfills me.

[01:44:13.700] - Speaker 1
But it sounds like when you go to Mexico, you can turn it off a little bit.

[01:44:17.950] - Speaker 2
Exactly. That's exactly right. It's the one place where I can go, because there's something about that. Even though I'm turning it off, there's a force of energy that is with me, that is sort of soothing me and feels like I'm doing something when I'm not doing something. And that's what I was talking about when we were talking about the waves and we're talking about Mexico. We're talking places. You can go to a place that's dead still and there's an extraordinary relaxing energy, or you go somewhere that's dead still and there's no energy.
