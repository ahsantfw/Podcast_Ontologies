[00:00:08.570] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammat.

[00:00:22.530] - Speaker 2
Basically London and. London and La back and forth. But I just follow the work of that period of. But I think that period of my life is stopping. Just going with the work, essentially, my work being my wife's saying and whatever she wants. Yeah, I do. But I don't know if I like that relationship anymore. You feel me in the way that it's the working relationship, putting her before me. I see when it's coming from me.

[00:00:54.210] - Speaker 1
Is it two way?

[00:00:55.200] - Speaker 2
No, it's not. It's just the way I've set up the relationship is wherever she wants. Wherever. All right, cool. This is what we got to do. All right, cool. Let's go there. And I've done it for basically 18 years, career. And I can see it's taking this toll on me because it's not reciprocal. Yeah.

[00:01:13.370] - Speaker 1
Have you talked to her about it?

[00:01:15.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's why I went away. I see the work. That's why I went away to kind of go, this isn't all right. It's not sustainable. Do you know what I mean? And it's like it got me to where I wanted to get to very quickly, which I think I wanted. But I'm looking at it and going, what do I want? And I'm now realizing, especially after this kitchen process, I'm realizing, oh, this is all a reflection of me working, is all reflection of who I am and my character, not what I can do. It's who I am. And if I'm not pouring into who I am, what am I doing?

[00:01:54.520] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like you're always in the characters you play?

[00:01:58.710] - Speaker 2
Yeah, of course. I always feel like how I've always see acting is like I'm using who I am to show you who I'm not.

[00:02:06.490] - Speaker 1
Say more about that.

[00:02:09.450] - Speaker 2
This guy's here, this character. This guy's here. I go, cool. I go to him and I find similarities. I find things that, oh, he's like me. Like this. He's like me and, oh, that's how I can. Because I want to root it in something real and present it and put on a patina and an esthetic and a whole aura that isn't me. But because it's rooted in something that I connect with, do you know what I'm saying? It's rooted. It's like, difference between what I aim for. I don't give you a pot of plant and go, here I go. Come look what I've grown. You feel me?

[00:02:50.010] - Speaker 1
How long does it take before you become the version that we get to see.

[00:02:55.770] - Speaker 2
I'll be like, probably a month. I probably lock myself off a month and I just immerse myself. I think about it, I kind of dance around it, but I think I'm just getting intel and stuff and infamous. I'm interested in that. I'm interested in that. And cool. It just starts arriving. Real things.

[00:03:17.100] - Speaker 1
And this wouldn't be what you're discussing isn't rehearsal. This is like you understanding who the person is in the context of this project. Is that right?

[00:03:28.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's like, kind of like. So when I'm on set, I'm not actually working, I'm presenting.

[00:03:37.930] - Speaker 1
You're just being.

[00:03:38.980] - Speaker 2
I'm being. I'm like. It came from process. I learned this way because I did this play when I was 21 called sucker Punch at royal court. And then I was like, I was overweight and then I got cast and they were like, is this guy going to do it? And had to be a lightweight boxer. And I just was like, I'm going to do it. And I'd never been slim in my life. And so I was like, all right, cool, I'm on it. Yeah. Then I got down to eleven stone. I can't remember what that's in pounds. Well, I lost 42 pounds in three months.

[00:04:07.980] - Speaker 1
Wow. How did you do that?

[00:04:09.970] - Speaker 2
Boxing, skipping. I sat down with a nutritionist with a british tennis team, and I just was non stop. I was nonstop. And how I did that is I had a target, I had a purpose, I had a reason. Because if I did that now, without the purpose, I wouldn't get there. If I'm being real, I had a reason that I connected with emotionally, and I got there. But when I did that, when I then performed it, I was like, I am different. Like, I didn't have to act. It's coming from, like, box. Every night I was getting shin splints. And then in the block that I grew up with, you know, when there's a swings and then there's like the kind of soft bit of swing, I had to skip on that to kind of do the 30 minutes skipping every night because I did this two minute monolog where I had to skip and act in the round and go and do tricks. Wow. So I would boo 30 minutes every night. And the people I grew up with, I remember once I had my headphones and listened to music. Skipping, skipping, skipping. And then I didn't realize my boys I grew up with were behind me watching because my back was to them and they looked at me and I turned around, they remember this is 10:00 at night.

[00:05:16.470] - Speaker 2
And they looked at me and I was like, this acting thing serious for you in it? I was like, yeah, because it's just dedication. And then when I was playing the character, I didn't feel I was acting. I was being.

[00:05:30.570] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:05:31.020] - Speaker 2
So then I found point. I found, like, a north star, and then I reached for that. That was a long process. Three months. I was gifted in that. You don't usually get that, but now I always reach for that lived in nature of the character where I'm not really acting. I'm just there.

[00:05:50.640] - Speaker 1
What happens? Offset, like, can you turn off the character? Are you the character for that whole window of time on and offset?

[00:06:00.050] - Speaker 2
No, but I'm in the vibe. I'm in the vibe because I'm doing his rituals. Offset, do you know what I'm saying? It's like, so say, as if chairman Fred, I'd heard that he listened to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. I would just listen to that every morning. Every morning, non stop. And the exact speech.

[00:06:18.720] - Speaker 1
So you're living the character's life so.

[00:06:21.950] - Speaker 2
I don't have to be the character when I'm in my wood. I used to keep the accent going throughout, and then I realized I need to rest. You know what I'm saying? And so it actually makes it richer if I rest. So I would just be myself. But doing what he does, listening what he does, and kind of getting in that vibe and understanding and having goals. Someone said to me is like, you sniff around the character, you sniff around him, and you understand these rituals. He's habits, he sings. But this is someone playing a real life person where it was a different thing for me. Because usually if you have a character, you're creating the target, you know what I'm saying? While with them playing a real life character, there is a target.

[00:07:07.070] - Speaker 1
How important is that your representation of a known character is like that known character, or can you find either a metaphorical or some other variation on that character that's more interesting to play that character?

[00:07:25.850] - Speaker 2
I think at the end of the day, you've got a narrative that isn't a documentary, so you're serving a story. So it has to be an interpretation if you do it. Sometimes I've seen people do real life people and they've got it right, but it feels wrong because you're serving a piece, you're serving an intention. So then what I do is I'll watch that person and I go, how does he make me feel? I want others to feel like that. Then I go for the energy that makes people feel like that. And then that allows me to make other decisions.

[00:08:03.950] - Speaker 1
How much is body language a part of it?

[00:08:07.130] - Speaker 2
Everything. It's the aura, it's the essence. How you walk, how you drop your head, how you like, how you look someone in the eye, how you tilt your head, how you like, just the whole. How I smoke. Like, say it's in Judas. I would just smoke in every night. I don't smoke, so I would smoke every night, like herbals. And just because I get really frustrated when I see actors that don't smoke smoke and it feels inaccurate and it's just like 2 seconds on screen, but that stuff gets you out of it. So I would smoke every night and film myself and go, do I buy it? Yes or not? Do I buy it? Yes or not?

[00:08:41.110] - Speaker 1
So you'd film yourself, like testing yourself.

[00:08:43.700] - Speaker 2
Almost to see if it's real amazing. Because if you're saying a line and then just going for us and even having the instinct of wanting to smoke and when you have the instinct is.

[00:08:56.760] - Speaker 1
Even the way you hold the cigarette. Every aspect.

[00:08:58.930] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It has to be lived in. It's the detail that actually gets it to the next level. Like, yeah, my lines of delivery is whatever. It's just those little things. I think certain things, you're like, I've got bigger. And then I'm like, I'm too big. And then I go cardio. Because it's just like, yeah, he was big, but he has to feel nimble. It's just everything is that going to a feeling and then everything is just an. It's not an imitation, it's an interpretation. And so then it's vulnerable. But you have to go, this is what I think. And people go, well, I don't think that. Yeah, but this is what I think. And you have to just stand on it. But for me, I have to just be so committed and confident to stand on what I feel and what I think so that no one can.

[00:09:49.130] - Speaker 1
Nothing can knock you off because you're being it. You're not trying to do it, you're being.

[00:09:54.820] - Speaker 2
I'm being. And I like this. I like this, what I like, but I like this. If you can, this what I like. And if you are very aware and very in tune with what you like, I feel like no one can shake me and I just stand on that.

[00:10:12.880] - Speaker 1
How similar would you be from take to take? Or might it be really different because you're just the person and the person wouldn't do it same way every time.

[00:10:20.680] - Speaker 2
I'm not even aware. I know I've got the same structural, skeletal. I do things intentional, like, say, if there's a rise in pitch, that's intentional. I remember when sometimes I do ADR, which is additional dialog recording when you go back, and then they were like, oh, yeah, it's really quiet here. Could you say it louder? Goes, no, I meant that. But in terms of how I do that, I let go of being good a long time ago and being great a long time ago. I want to be honest, and it liberates me when I watch my work a year later and you kind of go, flip. I want to do it like that now. And it's. What's frustrating about the process of acting is that you're the best person for the job at the end of the job. Do you know what I'm saying? And so you're like, oh, snap. Fuck. But you have to just commit to where you're at and be going, this is how I feel. This is where it is. And so some text is like that. That's how I feel. And I just let it go, and then, boom. Let it go, then boom.

[00:11:20.900] - Speaker 2
If I know what it's about, I know what I want. And if someone does something different, how could I not respond to that? It's listening and responding. It's as simple as that. It's not really that rough night, but sometimes people find it really hard to just listen and respond to that. It takes a long time to get to that place to find that simplicity of going. You're doing that. I respond to that, and then it's that.

[00:11:43.460] - Speaker 1
And when you're listening, you're listening to the actual words. You're listening to what the person is saying to you and reacting to those words.

[00:11:52.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And the tone, everything you listen to, everything. The body language, the energy, what those thoughts trigger in you, and you're open, so whatever you. Anything. But I got that from improvisation. I did improvisation for three years, from 13 to 16. That was how I got into acting. I didn't look at a script, so you have to be present. And I used to have this saying when I was doing improv, like anna shared. She passed away recently, rip, man. But I had this rule, like, once you're in your head, you're dead. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm there. And whatever you do, I'm taking that in because you're not having lines. Anything is a clue for the next line. So we can build, so we can find out who your character is. Who my character is. What is the storyline and narrative? And then we land on something. All right, cool. Let's go. And so then when I then was given lines, characters, I was like, wow, this is a lot. This is an abundance. But I'd still keep. My thing was like, when something is so premeditated, how do I keep that essence of real life?

[00:12:58.660] - Speaker 2
How do I keep that essence of spontaneity? How do I keep the essence of randomness? How do I keep the essence of.

[00:13:05.130] - Speaker 1
How do you do it? Tell me how. Yeah.

[00:13:08.250] - Speaker 2
Do you want to try dinner? Okay, so say as if, boom. Like you're doing an improv and that. So say as if, like, cool, I'll go like, where's your socks?

[00:13:18.080] - Speaker 1
I don't wear in socks.

[00:13:19.710] - Speaker 2
Why you moving your hand like that? I don't even know why you're moving your hand like that. I told you where your socks. I'm not even being like. I'm not even being this way. Why are you moving your hand like that?

[00:13:27.730] - Speaker 1
How was I using my hand?

[00:13:28.870] - Speaker 2
You were using your hand, Rick.

[00:13:30.280] - Speaker 1
You're using your hand.

[00:13:31.970] - Speaker 2
Yes, I'm using my hand to express how you're using your hand. There's no point.

[00:13:35.090] - Speaker 1
You were using your hand before. I use my hand, probably now you're smiling.

[00:13:37.650] - Speaker 2
What's funny? Do you think it's funny?

[00:13:38.810] - Speaker 1
Funny? It's funny that we're having a conversation.

[00:13:42.800] - Speaker 2
About I even fuck with shit like that? No. Even if you want to do all this stuff, like, you got me out here doing that, doing all hand movements, smiling, showing me your teeth, and I'm sitting there trying to be serious. I know what the fuck you're on, bro. You're still laughing.

[00:13:57.350] - Speaker 1
I'm still laughing.

[00:13:58.080] - Speaker 2
It's funny. You're a comedian, then you do comedy. Comedy.

[00:14:02.510] - Speaker 1
You want to bring the comedy comedian now? Not the comedian?

[00:14:05.170] - Speaker 2
Because I've done a couple of comedies in the cup of my life, bro. I've done a couple of comedies. I'm not proud of the comedies I've fucking done, but I'm fucking. And it's that.

[00:14:12.130] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:14:12.690] - Speaker 2
And so now it's about us, probably. You're a better comedian than me. I'm pissed that you're better. That's really the undercurrent is that you're a better comedian than me. We're two comedians, and you'll find it funny and I'm insecure, but, wow, you run. It's not premeditated.

[00:14:31.670] - Speaker 1
You listen to what's there and you.

[00:14:33.370] - Speaker 2
Respond, and then you go, and then if you're with somebody, go, I call. We're comedians. I think you're really funny, and I think I'm insecure about being funny. So anything you do, I'm going to fucking gaslight you by. But then you just understand it. And then you build and build. That's what I learned. That's what anna share fit was about. That's what I kind of, it makes you kind of go and you want to for me. And also, as well, it's like you have this other fourth wall of which is a bunch of kids that don't give a fuck, that you're trying to make laugh or you're trying to make listen, or you're trying to lean in, and it's just grabbing that and giving real reactions because you're just in it. So then obviously, when you're doing a scene, once you're in it, you give, like, a little bit of leeway. So in the edit, a couple of improvised lines that they can play within an edit and stuff like that. But then it actually gets you to double down and understand where your character is coming from and play with ideas and go, oh, yeah, that didn't work, but then cut it if it doesn't work.

[00:15:31.050] - Speaker 2
It's a hard thing to describe, but because it was the way that I learned how to do it, it's something I intimately know. And reading people and knowing every single inch, we are so limited to words mentally, like thinking that we just say things with words. We say things with everything. Words are a technology and not a great one, honestly. It doesn't really describe how you feel that more time, it's what you do. And so when you understand that dichotomy, then you're able to kind of swim around and play around and then build upon, and then it's just that thing where accepting, saying yes. So say, as if I said, you as a comedian, a thing you can't say, no, I'm not a comedian. Because then that stops the flow.

[00:16:19.610] - Speaker 1
Is that a rule of improv?

[00:16:21.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Well, why? I studied. Yeah. It's good to accept, to say yes. Any idea that's thrown, you say build yes and yes and yes and yes.

[00:16:29.780] - Speaker 1
And do any things come up in improv that become things you have in your pocket that you could use again someday? Is every improv starting from zero? Or might you say something one night that you think is funny and that you remember and then that might come back? Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:16:47.750] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it could do. It could do. But I think where the class that I learned all this from, it was about throwing it away. And sometimes there would be device pieces. That kid that had the play was like, oh, yeah, I want this to happen. Want this to happen. This to happen in the scene. And it was our job how we got there, you know what I'm saying? And then if you're doing it again, say as if you was voted best play, best devised play, and you did it for the performance, then you would have to remember what really worked about it, but still keep it loose enough to find some new stuff, but then not be too indulgent where you're actually just like, kind of wanking off and just going, oh, look how quick and great we are actually going and serving the goal and the intention of the piece. Now we are clear about who we are. It's freedom. But also once you land this restraint and find the freedom within that restraint and within those boundaries. I've never really even thought about this, but this is how I kind of feel I learned through.

[00:17:50.170] - Speaker 1
When you're doing improv, you mentioned being in it with the person that you're doing it with or the people you're doing it with. But you also have an audience and are you aware of them? Do you take them into consideration? Are they part of the improv or not?

[00:18:05.850] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because it'd be fake for them not to be. Because they're there. Yeah, because they're there. It's a performance. It's not a conversation. So this is just my philosophy, my belief. I'm there to serve the audience and grab their attention. I think the classes that I grew up in, there's a bunch of kids, when you're crap, they laugh. So it was the toughest play. It was so real. You wasn't entitled to their attention. If you're boring, they would start playing on their phone and playing. Was it back when they were snakes on Nokia? They were playing games. They were like, whispering this guy shit. And you would hear it.

[00:18:47.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:18:48.600] - Speaker 2
It's not like they're there where that chair is dead there and you hear what they're saying. It's an instant feedback that makes you go, this isn't the right decision, and forces you to go into another place if you wish to, or you could just stop. But then why? You can't stop because you're on the stage. It's a big stage. So then for me, it's just like, I go, I want them to lean in. I want them to listen, I want them to be with. You can feel them. They're with you. And when you're with them, you got them in your role. It's like a very, like, it's a relationship that they're there, but again, you have into them having to feel like it is private. Do you know what I'm saying? And they're not there. So it's a thin line of making it feel real, but also understanding that you're doing it for them. And that's the kind of line that you're treading.

[00:19:39.300] - Speaker 1
So you can't break that wall and start talking directly to them. Or can you?

[00:19:43.210] - Speaker 2
You can if it's required. Like, I remember one time I did a pilot. I was unannouncing a pilot, and then I just did this random voice and I looked directly to them because, I don't know, I just felt I need to do it directly to them because it was a surreal moment in the improv. But you could do what you want as long as it feel was real. Like, just don't reject it. I want to do that. I'm going to do that more time. It's about anyone that's like that and doing that is like, well, who's that in the scene? In certain scenarios when it's happening, are.

[00:20:14.730] - Speaker 1
You always in the moment or are you ever thinking ahead?

[00:20:18.470] - Speaker 2
I'm in the moment. The moment gets me ahead. If I take a step, I want to go there. If I trust that I'm going to want to go there, I'm not going to focus on. I'm just going to one step, one step, one step. What's that thing? Drop by drop. A river is formed. Focus on that. If you really mean it, you want to go there. If you focus on this, you'll get there. It makes you surrender and not be too controlling.

[00:20:46.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it sounds like free. Like you're free and it's a great feeling present. It probably is also tiring because you have to really be paying attention.

[00:20:55.290] - Speaker 2
It's very like you're on. It's, like, heightened. And because that was my way of creating. Now, in every state of creating, I'm in that height. And that's why it's quite draining because I'm just so on. It's like, say, if I do certain interviews or it's just the way I show up in a focus way and I'm like, I'm on. All right, cool. Take in. And then you have to go to places that top you up and water you and stuff like that.

[00:21:26.230] - Speaker 1
You said that there was probably a time that you wanted to be good or great. But then you got to the point of where you realize you just want to be honest. When do you think that shift happened?

[00:21:37.180] - Speaker 2
I was tired of killing myself. I was tired of ruining myself. When I watched my performances, I was like, I hate. Why did I do that? I wouldn't do that. You're crap. You're this. So much self hate. I was like, bro, if I keep doing this, I would not want to do this. This isn't fun. What's the point? And go, what am I doing? Like, I'm ruining them. I'm, like, so tough on myself because my stands were so high. But I would feel that, say, as if I'm doing this. Remember, this is after school club. These improvs. It's five pound a class. It's for underprivileged kids. So I'm doing it. I'm there and I do it. Improv. And then I'm on the bus home and a line would come to me.

[00:22:19.050] - Speaker 1
Because, fuck, I should have said that.

[00:22:20.680] - Speaker 2
Fuck, I should have said that. Beating yourself up for the whole week, Rick. Wow. The whole week I'm at school thinking, I should have said, and then you're building upon that line. You're building and building next time. I just got in that habit of, like, I think in a habit is probably what my inner dialog it was at that time of just beating myself up, going, no. And then when I get the bang. So then when I was more in a professional context and I watched my work, I just did the more professional version of that. And I'll be like, nah. But it's really tougher because now it's like millions of people watching it. And it's not like a week ago, it's like four months ago or six months ago or a year ago, and you're like. And you've grown so much. And you're looking at, you go, shit. And you're like, whack, whack, whack, whack. And then I just realized that me wanting to be so good and so great was hurting me. And then it was hurting me. It was. In hindsight, I see, I didn't realize that at the time, but in hindsight, I see that it was limiting my growth and how much I could be because I was prioritizing how I was perceived or my ego, or just I wasn't in service of the piece.

[00:23:41.140] - Speaker 2
I was in service of myself and wanting the next job or looking good in front of people or looking like the best or all that shit. I was more focused on that as opposed to just telling the truth and going home. Do you understand? And so then I realized that when I tell the truth and go home, when I'm honest, then I'm free. If I pour and give all that I can and I'm honest, I'm genuinely free. No one can say anything to me. Especially me.

[00:24:09.770] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because you're being true in the moment, and that's all there is.

[00:24:12.620] - Speaker 2
It's all there is. I did all I could, and I think, like, yeah.

[00:24:16.700] - Speaker 1
Could you have played Wild Bill in the movie instead of Fred Hampton?

[00:24:23.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:24:24.540] - Speaker 1
And what would that have been like? How would it have been different?

[00:24:28.210] - Speaker 2
You can't have the light without the dark.

[00:24:31.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:24:31.760] - Speaker 2
If light. If it's consistently light, you ain't going to register it as light. It's just consistent. It is, yeah.

[00:24:37.350] - Speaker 1
And there's nothing.

[00:24:38.240] - Speaker 2
There's nothing. When you have the dark, then you are able to identify and define the light. So I believe that whatever the story wants from me, I am prepared to give it, and wherever it wants from my soul and where I'm at or where the director feels I'm at, or then I can go, all right, cool. Is it whether I want to get in that space or not? But I do think that I could have played him. Yeah. And it's just that Shakar, the director at the time, saw that his vision is the key synergy. Do you know what I'm saying? But it would be a different film, though. Yeah. And that's my thing. It's like, for sure, it's just a different.

[00:25:16.530] - Speaker 1
So tell me about the different directors you've worked with. How different are they?

[00:25:22.530] - Speaker 2
So, like, someone like Steve McQueen. Right. I see him as, like, a composer. He describes it. To me, it feels like jazz, that we are all jazz players, and he's looking for the surprising moments. He's looking for that kind of like when a thought arrives to you in the moment. He's creating boundaries and the thing, and he puts people that he trusts and that are that way inclined, that are open enough to say the thing and then let reality show up through us. He is that, and he's got an innate understanding of human beings. And one time I did a scene, and he was doing another scene in a different location, and I went to do, like, a stunt rehearsal, and I came back to the other location he was at, and he said. And he said to me, what did the room tell you? He said, oh, you get it. Yeah. That's the way it does. Like, you go in there, you don't know what you're going to do. When you got the size. I kind of, kind of learn the lines, and then you're like, I'm like, 60% there. Then the room's got to tell you what to do.

[00:26:39.560] - Speaker 2
Your energy's got to tell you what to do. Then you start making decisions, because that's what life is like. I came in there, I thought I was going to be in a seated situation with you, no socks. I thought, this can't be. So I got to take off my shoes, and then I'm here. It's the environment, then you're in it. So I think he very much encourages that and actually prioritizes that.

[00:27:00.770] - Speaker 1
So even in terms of dialog, like, he's more flexible with the dialog to where improvisation is more apart could do.

[00:27:09.690] - Speaker 2
But I think I'll tell you what is about improv. I was always improv, but then I started being quite enamored with how you get that improv quality within the restraint of boom. I think that's what doing theater gave me.

[00:27:27.180] - Speaker 1
Does that have to do with timing? It's like when you say the line, how loud you say the line, the pitch, how long you wait before you say all those things.

[00:27:39.390] - Speaker 2
I just got really, like, I found it really rewarding to kind of go, how do I? I could say a line that makes that happen, but then that just means I don't trust the writing, and if I trust the writing, the guy. Right? Cool. And actually, it was actually an experience on Sicario and learning from Benicio, watching Benicio del Toro, and he was like, kind of like, how do you say less? So he was taking outlines. I'd never seen that in my life. I was like, this guy is a dawn, and it is that. He's just like, I could say it with my face. I could say that with my face. And I started to be more going, how do I say more with less? I started being way more on it with that, and I think it's just my kind of thing. I'm not saying it's better than anything else. I just go, Wolf. It feels like, because I don't think people expose much in real life in terms of their manner, only in extreme situations, they do when they're really pushed.

[00:28:43.420] - Speaker 1
And in terms of a challenge, getting all of the content across without saying anything, that's a noble challenge to take on. How do you do that? It's cool.

[00:28:53.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's cool. I just find it cool. So that's how I would do that. But then it was like, how do I express that improv quality with a look, with a gesture, with an energy shift as you do that? That's what the camera really reads. Because then you're not saying four, you're saying two plus two, and then the audience leans in. If I give you the line and tell you four, four, four, then you're like, jayz album.

[00:29:20.910] - Speaker 1
It's like you're finding the words as you're saying them. So the camera sees you finding the words, not just saying the line.

[00:29:31.140] - Speaker 2
The thought is what. Especially during this process on the kitchen and being in a post production, detailed in the edit, I'm always finding interesting when the thought arrives. That's what I realized. It made me articulate what I care about when I act. It's like, douche. That's what's fascinating. And then what are you going to do with that?

[00:29:54.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah, you may say the line. You might not even say the line because you feel the thought.

[00:29:59.680] - Speaker 2
The thought, yeah. You see something happen, and it's like that shift is what is rewarding, is seeing an evolution. The enamoring quality of storytelling is evolution. So if you see someone changed by someone, it's happening. If you are ready, then you're ready. But if you like going, and then you move, and then you move on that, then the thought brings the line. So I'll give you example. Say, I see people like, I see my friends like, oh, Daniel, brother, I ain't seen your film. I said, bro, it's cool. It's not cool. I want to see it. I said, bro, the fact you want to is the thing when you do it is up to your life. You may have kids, you may do whatever the want is the thought, and that's the valuable thing. The act is the product of the want. So that's how I see the acting thing is like, the line is the product of the thought. And seeing that thought arrive is the valuable bit of the storytelling for me. And so then I go, and then the line is the actualization of that shift. So I look to someone else's line.

[00:31:17.170] - Speaker 2
I'm listening, going, what is triggering this thought that makes me say this line? That's what I'm looking out for. So I'm there with you, and one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life in acting. It's mad simple. I saw Josh Broden did something amazing. Yeah, I said a line, and then I'm not trained, so sometimes I have diction issues, and then. So I'm working on it continuously. And then when I was in the. I was in the scene and he was going for it, and I said the line, and Josh had a line next, and then he just went, what? And then I said the line again and then he replied, because he's there.

[00:32:00.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:32:01.970] - Speaker 2
He's not got the performance ready. Yeah, he's listening, he's listening, he's listening. So he's like, what?

[00:32:07.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:32:10.770] - Speaker 2
And then I had to say it again. He got, oh, yeah. But it's not like that revolutionized my whole brain. I was 25. I'm going, what the fuck? That is the coldest shit I've seen in my fucking life. It's so simple. It's like an insignificant scene. It was like, that is one of the most, like he was there and it weren't fake, and it made me go, that's the north star. I mean it. I'm not going to say it until I hear it. Why am I saying it? It's as simple as that. And it's the audacity to stand on that and commit to that, because that's what real life is. If someone, you just go, what do you like? There's someone, I know that she's from the south, and I've got a deep London accent. We don't really understand each other. I misinterpreted her, she, me, but we all got bad intentions. But that's what life is, and that's what you want. You just want to be listening, and then that dictates every other decision. But, yeah, that Steve McQueen kind of creates that space and then someone else. That's extreme in another sense would be, I think, like, Ryan Kugla is very much very bespoke.

[00:33:19.760] - Speaker 2
I would see him very bespoke that he speaks.

[00:33:21.680] - Speaker 1
Describe that.

[00:33:22.400] - Speaker 2
He speaks to everybody differently. He speaks to everyone. He understands, and he's in it with you. Like, say, as if there was like a screen test and it was really cold and the girls were doing a screen test. He would take his jacket off and be in his t shirt, because I'm in it with you. He's in it with you. So you feel like you don't feel like an object. You feel like you have a collaborator, you have a partner, you have someone that's in the battle with you, and then he knows you, and he'll speak in what would bring what he wants out of you, but he would speak in the way that you would understand, and I'd see he would speak differently to different people. And that was really interesting. That was really interesting to see that. And it's something that I've kind of adopted when I have directed and stuff. And knowing that you got to speak in a way that it's not about just communicating. Communication is. People think communication is expression, communication is commune. So you have to receive it in order for it to be communicated. And so people just prioritize what I want to say and they don't acknowledge in how you receive it.

[00:34:38.310] - Speaker 2
And it's landing.

[00:34:39.950] - Speaker 1
It's about landing.

[00:34:41.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And I think he understands that. And he understands I want it to really land. So I'm speaking to you and so you feel quite spoken to and seen.

[00:34:52.730] - Speaker 1
How different is it depending on the skill level of the actor you're working with?

[00:35:02.410] - Speaker 2
It's different in the sense that I think being doing a lot of low budget stuff, like starting my career, it was all low budget and short films. And a, you have only two takes. You don't have a lot of time. You have a lot of time. And b, not everyone's there. So I think I've learned how to, if the camera is not on me, I've learned how to lean heavy on something to get out. I'm going to give it tailored to you the most you need so that it really comes out. It jumps out. If I hear some director saying something, I would then support what he's saying and support what he wants because it's about it coming out because we're in. But some people, you don't need to do that. And then they're able to get their own wave and they've surprised you and that will evolve what you're doing. So it's more like a dance. That it's like a dance. And sometimes you have to lead more than needed. But if someone is able to understand the steps, then you go into new spaces and do some new moves. But it's a reflection of what both of you intended and what you want from them.

[00:36:08.530] - Speaker 1
Do you ever have it the other way where you're working with someone who's just so great that you feel like it makes you better?

[00:36:14.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I've had a couple of moments where I was like, I've had a couple of moments when I was like, someone said something and I went, I actually stopped. I was younger, I was like, that's not a script. But he said the line so fresh and so present and so in it that it felt improv. So it felt like he made it up.

[00:36:38.560] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:36:39.690] - Speaker 2
So I was like, I stopped, then I was like, whoa. I'll say it was Chris O'Dowd. I did this tv show with Chris O'Dowd, and he just said, I was like, what the fuck? And it just went. And then I was like, oh. A, I wasn't in it. B, I was, like, too premeditated in terms of what you. I was so controlling. Yeah, because I've been worked. I hadn't worked with people that were high level. Yeah, probably at that point, I was 19 and like. And I was like, oh, you're going to say it in a way I wouldn't even imagine. You're going to put intonations in places. I was like, oh, shit. And then it made me just let go of preconceived notions and preconceived thoughts, and then they go, just be more cool. They could say anything. It could come any way and a bit more. And I think that makes you. It's not like what I'm learning now. It's not like growth is not about adding. It's about subtracting and going, oh, I can let that go. And then you're richer for what you let go, is what I've learned about when you're dealing with someone great.

[00:37:53.010] - Speaker 2
So say if that Josh Brolin story that's dealing with someone great. And he showed me, like, I've got addiction, there's something that. There's thing that's in my way. I have an anxiety about something that I need to let go of, but also that I assumed he's just going to say the line because I said it, because that's the job. As opposed to completely different idea, which is actually being present, truly and listening, really. It's taught me a lesson in listening that was like, come with less, come to the scene with less, and then you will feel more.

[00:38:43.480] - Speaker 1
How would you say, developing these skills in your craft impact your daily life? Are you always listening? Are you always in that, regardless of whether you're on or not? How is life different than how it used to be for you?

[00:39:03.550] - Speaker 2
I think, yeah, I probably listen too much, and that's probably why I lean on certain vices to distract, say, as if I'm taking too much in. I'll be food, taste, like my phone, like things that I like, substances. You know what I'm saying? I'll be just like, all right, cool, let me get out of this vein. It used to be drink or saying, it's like, we just get out of this vein because I'm taking in too much and I have too many feelings about what I'm taking in. It makes me highly sensitive. So then I like silence. I like being by myself. I'm very comfortable in my own company because there's less to respond to. I can hear people's chaos and I can hear what they say. You can hear way more. And you have to kind of, like, I've had to learn tools to kind of deal with that and actually be okay with. It's actually being okay with what it triggers in me. I read somewhere like, I never used to be able to sit through a film because it used to trigger me too much fall asleep. The pandemic showed me that when I was like, because it was like I had loads of sleep.

[00:40:12.620] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'd watch a. But you could still fall asleep. I would fall asleep. So it wasn't about sleep. I was like, why am I sleeping? But it was as a moyo, it.

[00:40:20.620] - Speaker 1
Was like an escape. You wanted to escape.

[00:40:23.720] - Speaker 2
I would watch a film every day at like 11:00 a.m. In a pandemic. So I've had my good amount of sleep. I've read today, I've eaten my breakfast, a light breakfast, not a heavy breakfast that will slow me down. And then I would still sleep. So then it was basically even without devices, I was running away from it, from whatever it opened. Do you know what I'm saying? So I realized I had to deal with that. I had to deal with, like, why do I want to run? Why do I want to not take in or accept or maybe because. And it's not usually not what, it's usually that I like something about it. That's what has helped me. Like, what do I like about this?

[00:41:01.720] - Speaker 1
Do you get lost in the story or you?

[00:41:04.530] - Speaker 2
If I feel the director's confident, I get lost. You can see that in the first frame. It's just basically, do they know where they're going? Are they going to take you?

[00:41:13.750] - Speaker 1
And do you feel safe about the first frame? I feel like when a piece of music comes on in the downbeat, like in the first sound, you hear 100%, you really kind of have a feeling of what's about to happen. You learn so much before this song even plays. Just like the intention of the first note.

[00:41:36.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I'm obsessed with music. I love music because I think I love music because it's an art form that I'm not a part of.

[00:41:42.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:41:46.080] - Speaker 2
I'm obsessive. And there was a time I was just obsessed. And I knew 1st 5 seconds. I knew if this producer knows what they're doing or where they're going. But for me, it was like the notes they don't play. It's the notes that they leave out and they go, oh, they're confident, they know where. It's just. That's the same thing. It's like, same with the first frame. It's like they know where they're going. Or if it moves you, does it make you dance? If there's no intellectual word, there's no intellectual justification, nothing to think about.

[00:42:13.980] - Speaker 1
You feel it or you don't feel it.

[00:42:15.280] - Speaker 2
You don't. Does it move you? And that's whether that person intended that or that. They just have that innate intention saying, you just know what's going on. And that's how I feel, like in a film that allows me to surrender and I go on with you, but when I'm like, it's hard because sometimes it's like you're thinking. You're thinking different versions of it, and then sometimes you're just inspired and it's open in new way. I was like, oh, shit, I could do this.

[00:42:43.380] - Speaker 1
Do you make notes while you watch if you get ideas?

[00:42:46.400] - Speaker 2
No, I do. I watch that. I just write things down. I have this thing now, and what I'm doing now, I just started, but I have a list of my films that I love, and I just watch that every morning. That's the first thing I do, is watch the film I love before I read a script that I need to read, before I do things that I need to do.

[00:43:04.110] - Speaker 1
But a different one every day.

[00:43:05.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah, different one every day, but just like a joyous one. Social network.

[00:43:09.820] - Speaker 1
How many are there on your list of ones you love?

[00:43:13.760] - Speaker 2
30, 40? I've only done five or six of them now after I come back from holiday, because I remember I read somewhere. Yeah. And it said, you should always revisit the things that you love as a teenager because you are waiting there.

[00:43:32.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:43:34.660] - Speaker 2
It was like stuff that you went to just because you went to it. There was no, like, I want to do it, to use it to this. It's just like, I love it, and so I'm going there. And then you'll meet yourself again. That's what it says. You'll meet yourself again.

[00:43:46.730] - Speaker 1
Do you ever go back and watch something that you loved when you were younger and it doesn't hold up?

[00:43:53.020] - Speaker 2
Sometimes? Yeah, sometimes I find that with books where I've got, wow, I've moved. This meant a lot to me at that time, and now it was the time that was me receiving it. Not necessarily.

[00:44:08.220] - Speaker 1
It's like the right teacher showing up when you're ready. It's like at that point in your development, that spoke right to where you.

[00:44:14.500] - Speaker 2
Were to me, that allowed it. But then I've moved on and evolved from that, so now I revisit it. It wasn't about it. It was about what it triggered in me and what it developed and moved to me.

[00:44:24.770] - Speaker 1
I think that's what the best work does for me. The best work is the thing that triggers something in me more than me getting involved in it 100%.

[00:44:37.350] - Speaker 2
And that's what I feel like. This is what I think I'm starting to realize in this process. The kitchen is like, I think we're so media obsessed. Media has just, like, taken over all narratives, right? And just that style of narrative, because it tells you what to think. And it's the equivalent. What media does is go, here's a fish. And art goes, here's a fishing rod. Here's how to think about whatever the fuck you want to think about. Yeah.

[00:45:05.140] - Speaker 1
Or the art might even just say, look at this without saying, here's a fish. And then you get to say, oh, it's a fish.

[00:45:12.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:45:12.870] - Speaker 1
But you get to say that.

[00:45:14.180] - Speaker 2
Yes. Two plus two. Yeah.

[00:45:15.620] - Speaker 1
I don't like being told what to think.

[00:45:17.330] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I don't like it. I don't enjoy it. Always think, like, it's more interesting what I discover. But I think that way of thinking, of not liking what to think, is not common. I think people want to know what to think.

[00:45:34.060] - Speaker 1
I wonder.

[00:45:35.010] - Speaker 2
I'm starting to accept that.

[00:45:38.250] - Speaker 1
I don't believe that. I have to say I don't believe that. I certainly don't want to believe it. But I hold people highly enough to believe they don't want to be told what to do.

[00:45:52.400] - Speaker 2
Maybe this is me I'm thinking. I was like, I think I have authority issues, and I don't think a lot of people don't. They trust. They have whatever great relationship, whoever person that they had their great relationship with. And so they didn't create this autonomy. And then they go, oh, cool. This person says, let's go. They want to be led. And I think that's a different kind of person. And I think the culture that we have at the moment encourages that side of people and punishes people that aren't like that. Thus people, you have to really believe in it to hold on to wanting your own thoughts and wanting to think independently. And a lot of people, it's just not that deep for them to hold on to that. Then it's like, resist. They're not emotionally resistant to that way of being led.

[00:46:54.600] - Speaker 1
That's a heartbreaking idea to me.

[00:46:57.720] - Speaker 2
I think it's okay. Tell me why I think it's okay. Because it's like, well, then cool. What are we going to give them? It's like if you deny it, then you're consistently trying to get someone to do something that they don't want to do.

[00:47:16.110] - Speaker 1
I see.

[00:47:17.580] - Speaker 2
As opposed to giving them what serves them in the way that they want. It's that communication thing. It's accepting and believing what you see. Understood and going, yeah, have that. That's how this person wants it. Maybe for me is a lot of my frustration with my creativity in my life. Is me being resistant to that. To me going, look at me and saying should is a cancer of a word. It's not even like I'm telling you what to think about how to think. It's like I'm like I'm being like them. As opposed to accepting and going, all right. You're like that going to think that?

[00:48:04.300] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I think it's cool that people do what they want. I just find it hard to believe that people just want to be told what to do and follow. I just find it hard to believe.

[00:48:15.600] - Speaker 2
I think it's because you don't.

[00:48:17.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I don't. That's my only point of view.

[00:48:20.640] - Speaker 2
You're rare. Do you think you're common?

[00:48:23.630] - Speaker 1
No, but I also think, I mean, historically, the things that I've liked seems like other people seem to like. Like I've made things that I like. A lot of other people like them. So I think there must be as odd as I feel, as different as I feel there's some commonality there because I'm not making anything for anyone else. I'm only making it for me.

[00:48:46.350] - Speaker 2
But the difference is that you made it. They didn't make it. So the fact that you can make, makes you separate to them means that you have a different idea. And they are like going, oh, cool. That person. That's what they're into. Cool. I'm just onto what, yeah, that's cool. And, oh, yeah, that is good. I like that moves me. They are looking to you to tell them, like, what's good? Oh, this is what you've heard. Because I don't think ideas are ours. I don't think. I think it's like, I agree. You're going into the pond and you're fishing, and then, so it's like you, signs arrived to you. You've worked your ass off in trying to actualize it. That's something that does. I'll give you boom. This is how I. It's how I interpret life, right? So then I go, this is what I've learned in my career. I'm from a cancer estate. I don't know if that's like the projects in London. People don't act from where I'm from. So I kept it a secret. And so everything I would do, like, I would go, I can see something's possible. And I go to Rick, do you see that?

[00:49:48.110] - Speaker 2
And then usually that person goes, they.

[00:49:52.500] - Speaker 1
Wouldn'T even see it.

[00:49:53.700] - Speaker 2
And then I go, all work. And then the win is putting it there. And that person say, dan, have you seen this? It's mad, isn't it?

[00:50:08.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:50:08.730] - Speaker 2
I don't tell them, but now it's there.

[00:50:11.830] - Speaker 1
You show them.

[00:50:12.730] - Speaker 2
I show them, but that makes me drastically different to them. And what I used to be is in denial that I'm just different. Like, you're just doing a different thing sometimes. I was in Brooklyn a long time. I sat next opposite this guy. I said, how'd you spend your time? He's like, yeah, I make tables. I'm like, what the fuck? What do you mean you make tables? What? Tables? He said, I make the one that we have right now. He had, like, a fucking sewing machine at the bottom of it. And I'm looking at it, I'm like, how'd you get there? Yeah, I'm just going to buy whatever. I'm going to go to Ikea and buy a table. I don't need to understand. It's like there's different departments in life where I delegate, and it's whether I am aware of what I like or who I trust to receive what I like and what I trust. And some people go, I really like that. And they're able aware and identify that, but they're not in a business of, like, control.

[00:51:08.840] - Speaker 1
But we're talking about now thinking for someone else, which is different than making something for someone else that people want to be thought for. That's a scary idea to me.

[00:51:20.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:51:23.340] - Speaker 1
Do you know what I'm saying? It's a different idea. I want you to tell me how to live my life. That's crazy. No one can do that. There's no version of that. That's okay.

[00:51:37.520] - Speaker 2
But they do do that.

[00:51:38.800] - Speaker 1
I know.

[00:51:40.480] - Speaker 2
Do you think no one man can have all that power? I don't think it's like, sorry, cool. Like control and power. It's control and power.

[00:51:50.500] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:51:50.740] - Speaker 2
And freedom.

[00:51:52.030] - Speaker 1
It's either freedom or not freedom. Those are the choice. One is if you're free to decide what you want, how you want to do it, that's freedom. And if someone's telling you what you're allowed to do and not allowed to do, this is how you think about it. If you think about it differently than this, you're wrong. You're in trouble.

[00:52:12.520] - Speaker 2
But, rick, bro, I don't think everyone's prepared for the cost and responsibility of freedom.

[00:52:17.580] - Speaker 1
That's not a human thing.

[00:52:19.170] - Speaker 2
I don't think we've been prepared for it. A lot of people have been prepared for it. They haven't been given the tools to prepare themselves for that cost. Cool. It's like going in there and going, all right, cool. I'm lifting 300 pounds. You got to build up to lifting 300 pounds. Heavy weight. Yeah. That's another thing I realized. A lot of people want to perks for leadership, but they don't want to cost. And I find that in terms of being autonomous within your mind and within your thoughts and within your direction of your life, go. I want to go here. I want to go there. You have to go through a lot of mad experiences to be truly free in terms. And freedom is just like, oh, I can just do that. I want to do this. It's where I'm at right now. Me, I'm open to learn and figuring it out, but that's where, for me, I just feel like a lot of people are not prepared for that cost and they're cool with it. And I think the environment that has been built within the west doesn't actually encourage it because it's too complicated and there's too much choice.

[00:53:18.900] - Speaker 2
And so then it's like the overwhelming of, like, I feel like the Internet is just gone. Like, all right, cool. Knowledge is power. Give them all the knowledge. Then you don't know what to get because you got too much information.

[00:53:29.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:53:30.260] - Speaker 2
You mean, and now you're like, all right, come on, curate.

[00:53:36.160] - Speaker 1
I can actually argue the other side of what I was saying based on what you just said. That's interesting. I remember when the streaming revolution first started, and I remember feeling like, wow, I don't have to go to the store and buy a CD or vinyl that I could hear any piece of music I want at any time. If I just think of something that I heard 25 years ago, I could listen to that right now. And I thought, I'm just going to want to dj all day. And I came to realize very quickly, I don't want to dj all day.

[00:54:08.620] - Speaker 2
No.

[00:54:08.930] - Speaker 1
And I want to be programmed, too. And it's fun when a song comes on that I wasn't expecting. It's a great experience. And I love that I get to have discovery versus choice.

[00:54:20.220] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:54:20.740] - Speaker 1
And that's fun, too.

[00:54:21.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And people want to be frilled in that way. I would be like that back in day in radio shows. I'd be like, all right, cool. This is the DJ. I follow djs.

[00:54:30.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:54:30.820] - Speaker 2
And I go, speaks to me. He's going to drop a song that I've never heard. What's this? This is that. I just won't find it. It won't arrive. To me, that person is. That's their job. That's what they do. And you want to be kind of. That's what I'm trying to say. It's like, it's a frill when that relationship is trusting and enriching and opens doors for you. But I think the way that it sometimes is used now is used to control and is used to diminish and is used.

[00:55:05.310] - Speaker 1
What you're describing, though, is a trusted source who you pick.

[00:55:09.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:55:10.110] - Speaker 1
Imagine if you got assigned a source of what you were allowed to listen to musically and you didn't respect their taste. That wouldn't be good.

[00:55:19.620] - Speaker 2
No, it wouldn't. But then if there was no other options, wouldn't you just have to find the good in it?

[00:55:26.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah, well, that's how it used to be when everything wasn't on demand.

[00:55:33.320] - Speaker 2
Or you would create what you want.

[00:55:36.270] - Speaker 1
Yeah, exactly. I think that's something we've both done.

[00:55:41.900] - Speaker 2
Exactly that.

[00:55:43.340] - Speaker 1
Create the thing that isn't there that you want.

[00:55:46.070] - Speaker 2
I just make films I want to watch and I want my friends to watch. That's it. Simple as that.

[00:55:50.130] - Speaker 1
Simple.

[00:55:50.570] - Speaker 2
It's worthy of my time.

[00:55:51.740] - Speaker 1
Simple. And if you think past that, it'll screw the whole thing up.

[00:55:56.160] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And sometimes someone's got there and done it before me and we're like, oh, thank God.

[00:56:01.030] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I don't have to do it. It's the best feeling.

[00:56:04.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Cool. Let me see what they did. Oh, they were closer to it. That's it. If not us, then who?

[00:56:13.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's us.

[00:56:15.620] - Speaker 2
You just go in and just do it. But then that's a certain kind of person that has a certain kind of. Nah, I want it like this. You mean not everyone has. That is what I'm accepting and I feel like I've been quite baby. Like when a baby feels like everything is them, they have this reality where, like, oh, that this ball is me and this thing is me. That's what I kind of been internally in my creative life and feel like, why? If I can do it, you could do it. And that's been a kind of being dismissive of what I've been given and what radio station. I can hear.

[00:56:57.470] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:56:58.210] - Speaker 2
Saying it's like I can hear things because of the experiences that I've had and my exposure. Like the fact that my people in my family didn't speak English when I was a kid. That's interesting. Obviously, that leans itself for improv because I'm losing body language.

[00:57:14.110] - Speaker 1
If I ask you, what is the kitchen? You tell me what comes up for you.

[00:57:19.880] - Speaker 2
A representation of an energy and an idea that, for me, is the essence of what the London that I grew up in and the London that I saw. And I do feel that there is a kitchen and a corner of the kitchen in every city that has, like, fuck you. We do what we want and we don't give a fuck. You want us to leave? No. But the narrative manifestation of that is a self sufficient community within this film and kitchen, that they're the last land standing. It's like it's a community of people that are still connected, that still believe in oneness, that still believe in community. And they are being asked to leave, and they said no. And they are dealing with the repercussions of that answer is how it feels to me.

[00:58:21.340] - Speaker 1
So is it a realistic drama or is it science fiction? What genre is this story being told as? Is it in a genre?

[00:58:33.920] - Speaker 2
I don't think so. I think it has elements of a lot of things, and it has a science fiction conceit. However, at its heart, it's an intimate drama about this man and this boy and how they reconnect. I think when I boiled it down, it's basically when your relationship has changed with your child, how do you redefine a friendship after a level of absence? And that could be applied to a mother and daughter when their daughter's gone to uni or college for a couple of years and they haven't been seeing each other every day, and it comes back and that daughter is a different person, and now they have to redefine their relationship and actually find a friendship. And I feel that's the strongest bond to get to with a parent child. This is me. My faults right now, that's not me. This is what it is, because I'm just living my life and figuring this out. But that, for me, is what the. Yeah, the intimate drama of it is like knowing that in order to fight what's out there, you have to be together within yourself and with the people that you care and love about.

[00:59:55.660] - Speaker 2
And if you're at war with yourself, then you are no use to the war out there.

[01:00:00.700] - Speaker 1
Are you in it as well as writing it?

[01:00:03.500] - Speaker 2
No, I'm just directing it, writing it, and producing it. I'm not in it. Cool.

[01:00:06.660] - Speaker 1
And how's that experience of directing and not acting?

[01:00:10.400] - Speaker 2
I love it. I wrote my fifth play when I was nine. Used to write plays. I wrote on a show called skins when I was 1819, and then I was 19, wrote two episodes of skins, and I just had nothing to say. 19. I was like, I got to live, and then I've gone back to here and directing and writing, producing, it's just that kind of thing where it's got me to fall in love with the art again, because I think there's something about acting. The more successful you get, the more isolated you become. And I think I fell in love with the collaborative nature of it and what directing and writing and producing does. I think directing does. It allows you to collaborate and allows you to kind of talk in and allows you to have funny jokes with grips. It allows you to. You mean you're back in it? In the thick of it. It's not weird that I'm there when I go on set and I'm, like, hanging out is that people move, like, why are you here? And so it makes you feel like you don't want to be there because you're not supposed to be there, and then you find out why you're not.

[01:01:11.860] - Speaker 1
Supposed to be there, or you're just not required to be there. I think people usually go where they're required to be.

[01:01:16.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And you have to hold your position. You're playing a position. And I think with this, I fell in love with, like, I fell in love with having an idea, getting a team of people, having a fucking laugh, and having a great time, being really happy, and then producing something that is a reflection of that time that we had.

[01:01:40.290] - Speaker 1
That's great.

[01:01:41.170] - Speaker 2
That's what I fell in love with. And that's what I felt like I found with this is that, like, oh, man, I could just make things with people that I fuck with. I care about that, challenge me, that I grow with. I challenge them. And then we have a laugh. We do have funny jokes. We spend time. Then there's this thing that we've made that is essentially like a photo album of the time that we shared for us.

[01:02:08.210] - Speaker 1
What triggered the initial idea to make it? How did it start?

[01:02:11.910] - Speaker 2
I was in a barbershop where I grew up. And this guy was talking about these smashing grabs, which is like doing million pound heists in a minute. He was chatting. I'm sitting there, I'm like, this guy is chatting about his business. He's very trusting of everyone in this barbershop. And I kept. I listened to him. I listened. I was like, I really want to watch that film. I was just chilling in the barbershop. I was, like, waiting for my appointment. This is like ten years ago. I was like, I really want to watch that film. That'd be a sick film. I couldn't stop thinking about it. And then a couple of months went by, and that guy, I didn't see him again. And it kind of was vague, but they were kind of like, basically he went away. Like, I'm presuming he went prison or whatever. I don't know what kind of happened. And I was like, then I did more digging about around it and I was like, wow, they're doing these million pound highest in a minute. And they were getting paid 200 pounds, so they're robbing diamonds and they were getting paid 200 pound.

[01:03:12.130] - Speaker 2
And I was like, there is conflict in that. That says so much about London, that says so much about where we're at. That says so much about the worth, how valuable they believe their life is. There's so much happening in that. And then I was like, I got to go there. The esthetic intrigued me, and then the dichotomy made me dig.

[01:03:39.490] - Speaker 1
Where did the man and the child piece come from?

[01:03:44.340] - Speaker 2
My subconscious.

[01:03:48.360] - Speaker 1
You don't have children?

[01:03:49.500] - Speaker 2
No. And I think it was. What's the thing you're scared to say? Because what it was, we understood, it was like about the I and we. I was just obsessed about how people vote against their interests because they vote aspirationally. They go, this, I want to be there. Therefore, I'm going to support that and undermine myself and not accept where I'm at and that my reality and what was the intimate manifestation of that, you know what I'm saying? Which was basically a man that is so about himself is not being able to be present for a child that he's co created. That's where it was. And exploring that. It's about starting, I really believe, starting a character in a really negative place so they can really go on a journey and really put the ugliness up front. And what I've found in this process, when you put the ugliness up front, it then triggers people, because some people go, I wish I could do that. I wish I could be like that. Do you know what I'm saying? It was like. But there is a respect there because that person's being honest and they're telling you who they are, but who they are is not serving them.

[01:05:14.480] - Speaker 2
And they understand it's not serving them is who they've been taught to be. And it's them getting closer to who they are and what they care about. That's the journey of Izzy in this. And then Benji, as the boy, accelerates that journey within him. And then he learns. Benji learns and grows for himself as well.

[01:05:34.680] - Speaker 1
At what point did the father and son appear in the creation of the story? Because the first story that you told me, inspired by the conversation at the barbershop. It's not that.

[01:05:46.610] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:05:47.370] - Speaker 1
So at what point did it. The father and son, we shot a taster tape.

[01:05:51.010] - Speaker 2
So we shot in the barbershop. We shot a taste of tape, and I wanted it to be like reservoir dogs in the barbershop. And that's what we shot. And then it was just style. It was just cool. It didn't mean anything. Do you know what I'm saying? And then it was just these iterations about, like, what's he doing it for? He's doing it for his kid. And then the kid was like, a baby. A baby. I was like this. And it was like this noble thing, and it was like. But the reality is, it grew as we grew is essentially because I directed it with kid boy, Tavares. And as we grew, it grew. And as we were. More frank, I'm not going to speak for him. I'll speak for myself. But I was more frank with myself. I was more frank with my blind spots. It then go, well, let's talk about this. Okay, we have to go there. We have to go. And it kept on going. All right, cool. But I don't think that decision of that boy, that man, having a kid, was out of nowhere. But I just don't think it was where that we went there.

[01:06:45.600] - Speaker 2
And I don't think it's like. It's just things that are coming out that feels right. That feels right. But it's not like. Because I don't think I was that aware in my creativity to know that. I remember one time when I first wrote on skins, this is about this girl who has become pregnant, and she's got to decide whether she goes, go drama school or have this baby. Not drama school. Look freudian. Go music school or have this baby. And then when I watched it back when I was 18, I was sitting there, I was like, oh, this is about my wrestling with the fact, if I'm going to go drama school, if I'm going to just go fuck it, I'm going to go for this career. And it was coming out. And that's why I just felt like I could just do it. But I'm not aware.

[01:07:30.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's like a dream. You don't know what it means when it's happening. But if you look years later, if you wrote it down, it's like, oh, yeah, exactly.

[01:07:38.450] - Speaker 2
What? Yeah. So I think that's where the father's son came in. Because there are questions that you want to explore in the same way that I want to explore this esthetic, this world, those questions. And then we set in the future, not to distance future, because we want it to feel big, and we want it to be felt free from the rigidity of reality right now and actually be able to use our imagination. Do you know what I'm saying? And actually go imagine. And then you can actually tell more of the truth when you use more of your imagination.

[01:08:14.140] - Speaker 1
Did you have a full script before starting the film, or was it something that evolved as you're making it?

[01:08:20.910] - Speaker 2
Evolved continuously? Definitely continuously evolved. And that was the process because of the. What I realized is it's a reflection of the people that are involved.

[01:08:32.220] - Speaker 1
Did you start with an outline or anything, or was just right at the.

[01:08:35.700] - Speaker 2
Beginning of the process? Yeah, an outline.

[01:08:37.460] - Speaker 1
An outline.

[01:08:37.990] - Speaker 2
An outline. I wrote an outline.

[01:08:40.660] - Speaker 1
And was it an outline of to the end, or was it an outline of. This is how the story starts.

[01:08:47.220] - Speaker 2
The taster was just the outline of the taster. And what. There's specific scenes that had a loose arc and it had a loose beginning and end. But that version of the film would have been like 20 minutes. Then when we did that, we expanded on it. And then I did a whole outline to an end. And then you have that outline. Then you go back and forth with the production company, and then you're going back forward, producers, and building it up. And then you get to land to a more realized outline. And then you'll go to script. And then you write that script. The script I wrote is not the film at first ever film that's there. So it kept on evolving and kept on like the process allowed it to come to.

[01:09:27.940] - Speaker 1
Would you say that it's better than the script or different than the script?

[01:09:31.900] - Speaker 2
It's more realized than the script. It's more realized than the first ever draft. It's more succinct. It's more pointed. It's more honest. It's more in service. I'll be real. I think that first draft was trying to show how good I can write. And I thought it was a well written script, but who cares? So I think a lot of ego had to die in me and in all the people in order for us to get to where we got to. I mean, I started the script, like, at 23, 24. So I was trying to. I had a negative experience when I was 19, when I wrote. Co wrote a script. And I wanted to prove. I wanted to prove how good I was. I was in that good stage. Good, great stage. And then I think the story suffered because of. There was too much me there.

[01:10:23.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah. At any point, did you consider it being a series as opposed to a film?

[01:10:29.560] - Speaker 2
No. I mean, I've written so many versions where I could have a series worth of it, but no, I love film. I love the completeness of film. I love the fact that in a pandemic, I'm just watching something from the 70s, randomly from the 50s. I'm just there. I don't think you do that with tv shows. Even though I love Twilight Zone.

[01:10:54.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I was going to bring up Twilight zone earlier. I really was. When you described it being the way you described it, rooted in reality, but being able to go beyond reality, I was thinking, oh, like a father and son story taking place in the twilight zone.

[01:11:10.570] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly that. Exactly that way. Basically, Izzy works at a funeral home that turns bodies into mean because they've got this whole technology and turns bodies into trees because they've run out of space and they need to help the environment. They've run out of cemetery space. And if you have money, you have the option to choose where your tree is, and if you don't, and that's where it's just like. It's exploring what the principles and the conflicts of now through a surreal version of it, let's think. Let's imagine. Let's just go there. So the kitchen is this community that feels like an estate. It feels like a block, but it's a whole town. It's a whole community. It's supposed to feel like London. Supposed to feel like this isn't like yo. In my booking research. Yeah. I love. I'm obsessed about London. I think London's so interesting as a city because it was bombed. People don't actually forget that, that it was like Paris wasn't because it was occupied, and London was. And so a lot of it's temporary. And then what I realized when doing the research, a lot of like, in the blitz, it was fear.

[01:12:29.590] - Speaker 2
And nazis bombed London. And then people panic, panic, panic. And then when they survived, what then happened was sham invincible. There was an attitude like the fuck. And there was less fear the more they bombed. So it was having the opposite, it was making them more resilient. And I was like, oh, that is still in. We are in a lineage of that. That's still here.

[01:12:54.600] - Speaker 1
That's really interesting.

[01:12:55.640] - Speaker 2
Still here. That result, the positive outlook of that trauma still exists within the essence of London. I saw that when I was on a bus. When I was like eleven. I went to big boy school, went to a boy school, I'm on a bus now. The brothers, the older boys, is like, we try and get off the bus. The driver's like, you're not going to get off the bus. And he's like, open the thing, pressed the emergency button in the middle of the road and walked out. The fuck that. I could see that. Fucking shut the fuck out. And that's what I wanted to show and it's what I've been around and what I've seen and what I feel in me and I think a lot of my career and what I've done is because, bro, you can hit me and I'll get stronger. My thing, I need to stop because I have in the past gone to be hit in order to grow, which is a different thing that I'm learning to leave. But I just saw that. I thought that was interesting and I just saw that, like, I wanted that mean, but it's about, how do you imagine that essence?

[01:14:11.970] - Speaker 2
How do you cinematically articulate that?

[01:14:16.320] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the London you grew up in.

[01:14:19.140] - Speaker 2
Grew up in. I was born in Camdentown. Very punk, very counterculture. Very.

[01:14:26.610] - Speaker 1
Was this after punk rock or during punk rock?

[01:14:29.690] - Speaker 2
Ninety s. Ninety s. I was born in 89. And so then my first memories is of seeing people with spikes. I think it was just a point where people were still believing in it, but it was at the tail end of true punk, but it still had that kind of like, there was just no place in fucking England that is like Camden and it still had that. It's just like. And massive drug culture in Camden. And you're exposed to a lot. I remember one time this guy came on the bus and he had spikes on his boots, spikes on his trouser, spikes on his ting, and he had purple, spiky hair. And I'm looking, I'm like, what the fuck is happening? I'm like, six. I'm looking and my mom doesn't worried. No one else has bat an eyelid. And then it made me go, oh, then why I won't look at him weird then. So it taught me that people are supposed to be different. That's the punk. Actually living with that punk energy is like, okay, you're different and cool. It's accepting, it does not affect my life. Why would I care? It's not like even though it's like everyone care.

[01:15:39.160] - Speaker 2
Okay, cool. And I behaved. That's the one I grew up with. But also it's like I grew up in a block and in a state and it's just that kind of danger, that kind of excitement, that kind of like, everyone's funny. Everyone is up to a scheme. Everyone is. There's all these probably 95 doors and everyone. There's something happening, there's arguments, there's this, there's that, there's people losing, people losing their kids to the system. People like winning the lottery because they won like 500 pounds or there's so much life. And also for me it was like you weren't defined by what you didn't have. And I feel like minute I moved, I got better grades and I went to a better school because I got better grade better, I got good grades. And then what happens is I don't think the school was better. I think the school was seen as better or they allowed kids with good grades in and they didn't allow kids with not good grades in. I then became aware that I was working class and that idea and my identity was in conjunction to another class's identity. And I was like, but once when I was in.

[01:16:55.920] - Speaker 1
How old were you when that happened?

[01:16:57.870] - Speaker 2
1617.

[01:16:58.860] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but before, that's a long time.

[01:17:02.000] - Speaker 2
Before that I was just like, everyone's in it, no matter what race.

[01:17:05.690] - Speaker 1
Would you say it was happy childhood?

[01:17:08.600] - Speaker 2
I would say yes and no. I would say that it was happy, it was joyous, it was fun, and it was up to scheme you get you early, like, all right, cool. How'd you play with this trolley? And you learn how to just play with things around you? All right, cool. Throwing water bombs at people and running the streets and it's like. But it's real life. The blocks are filled with people that in hostels, majority were single mothers and they've got a property, Jamie. And you kind of like getting yourself up and build yourself up. This is the reality of my block. And then you leave. I was really resentful of gentrification. And then in this process I realized that the junction nature of London is London. The kind of people coming in and out, it's like, oh, it's the irish people.

[01:18:09.790] - Speaker 1
That's what makes London. London.

[01:18:11.150] - Speaker 2
Jamaicans. Yeah, it's the Somalis. It's the. The. There's a new wave come out, you come in, leave, come in. That whole thing about things are always supposed to stay the same. Holding on to that is hurting yourself, and it's supposed to move. I've worked hard to stay, and then I realize everyone's moved, so they want my fighting to stay for this place isn't the thing, it's the people. So that's why it was exploring that nature. When people say, no, I'm staying. But then what's the reality of, like, people go, oh, you should stay. But it's like, say, if your kid doesn't feel safe, why the fuck are you staying? Of course. And people don't actually realize this is real life. And I wanted to kind of show also.

[01:19:02.440] - Speaker 1
You didn't choose it originally?

[01:19:03.900] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:19:04.270] - Speaker 1
You just happened to be there.

[01:19:05.340] - Speaker 2
It's comfort, it's familiarity, and it's whether. If you had. What's that I love now. And I put that in all the decisions I make in my life. It's like, if I started this now, would we decide to do it this way, if not for anything? I didn't choose to grow up where I grew up. And then you got to a point where, like, would I choose to stay in this block? Would I choose here? Probably not. It's just what I mean, and it's that.

[01:19:33.090] - Speaker 1
Tell me about your family.

[01:19:35.140] - Speaker 2
Grew up with my mom, my older sister.

[01:19:38.180] - Speaker 1
How much older?

[01:19:39.880] - Speaker 2
Eight years.

[01:19:40.780] - Speaker 1
It's a long time.

[01:19:41.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And, yeah, like, from Uganda. They were both born there, so I was the only one that was born in England.

[01:19:50.440] - Speaker 1
Earlier you said people in your family didn't speak English.

[01:19:54.100] - Speaker 2
Obviously. My mom, early years, she came to England to give birth to it, was. She learned English, and in my life was a reflection of that.

[01:20:07.760] - Speaker 1
Do you speak ugandan?

[01:20:08.870] - Speaker 2
No, I don't speak ugandan, no. She spoke to me in English. That was our thing. But. So there's a lot of things that I don't have access to, but I do have access to in the sense that I can understand certain things, but I read body language and understand that that is a true language. And I take that in and I'll read tone. I will listen to tone to really understand. So there's like, if I go Uganda, I have an auntie that doesn't speak English. I don't speak ugandan. We have a great time. It's not like that. But yeah, so my mom kind of started from nothing and kind of grew everything. Yeah.

[01:20:47.170] - Speaker 1
Never met your dad.

[01:20:49.340] - Speaker 2
Did as a kid and then he left my life and then he passed away when I was real young and then I didn't really have a relationship with him. Now.

[01:20:59.840] - Speaker 1
An extended family or just your mom moved.

[01:21:03.380] - Speaker 2
I had aunties and I had cousins in London. In London. I had family in London and then basically it was cool when I think family stuff happened and then I didn't really beef in the family and then suddenly we didn't really work cool anymore. So then it was just that kind of the nuclear element of our family by post. Like 910, definitely. But I've got cousins in London. I've got a family in London.

[01:21:31.590] - Speaker 1
Was there music played in your house?

[01:21:33.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, lots. Like Bony M. Abba. Mom loves Abba. Mom loves Elton John. Mom loves Queen Michael Jackson. There's this ugandan artist called Philip. He's got this song called Born in Africa and a song called Entbe. And whenever I listen to it, it just triggers me and just such sweet music. And what's interesting about that time is like, no matter how much money you had, you had a great sound system. Everyone had a great sound system. And, yeah, music was just everything. It was just like, it was always played. Always played in my house. A lot of those guys, I love ABBA. Abba's cold.

[01:22:13.710] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Trying to picture it. How tall are the buildings?

[01:22:18.140] - Speaker 2
So including ground, because you guys include. It's four, so it's three. We would say free, but it's four. And only the top floor had upstairs. And it wasn't like a high rise, but it was big. And if you go on top floor, you can see down and you can see a great view of London and see all the buildings if you're at the top floor, that's where, when I wrote the script, wrote this woman, Cynthia past rip. She used to travel to Africa for half the year and then allowed me to house it. And I would write there and she was at the top flat and I could see the whole of London whilst I was writing. So it was a bit like that. You could see the view, not too high, but you can see were the.

[01:23:04.460] - Speaker 1
Buildings that you were in the highest buildings in the area or as high as the highest buildings in the area?

[01:23:10.440] - Speaker 2
As high as the highest building.

[01:23:11.470] - Speaker 1
So there were no skyscrapers around you?

[01:23:15.660] - Speaker 2
No, it was just like kind of like medium sized, kind of like buildings around. Yeah, it wasn't really a skyscraper environment. It was kind of the borderline of Camden. And like I would say like a no man's land. It kind of doesn't have a named think people call like Cantaloupe's or St. Pancras. And you can say it's Kentish Town, you can say it's Camden, you could say it's like near Market Road. It's this kind of like near Cali Road. It was just this area, but there was not a lot of high rises and there was like this amazing astro turfs pitches at market Road that everyone would play games in. And so the best footballers around the area would go there and all these teams would go there. We'd go there to play games. And it was a block across the road, there was a petrol Station there and it was like. It was a park down the road. Yeah. No, there weren't no high rises there like that. No.

[01:24:07.200] - Speaker 1
Have you ever done any kind of therapy?

[01:24:09.400] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:24:10.700] - Speaker 1
To helpful.

[01:24:12.860] - Speaker 2
Yeah man. A lot has happened in my head. I've experienced a lot of scene a lot. So it's good to let out, to kind of like work on not judging myself and really strengthen that muscle in me and acceptance and having safety, someone to partner up to accept things and going, all right, cool, let's accept that. And seeing it as that's something that I did as opposed to who I am and knowing that I did that, that's not me. I think it gave the point of view. I fought with a point of view and it allowed me to kind of grow and see things how they are and accept and believe. We see believe as an ugly word. If someone's like way inclined go, I believe you, that is that. And then you act accordingly. The conflict comes from not believing, resisting in that acceptance. So I think it's helped me with that. Have you done therapy? I have.

[01:25:19.990] - Speaker 1
You've done all different kinds. And it's interesting, I remember the first time I did therapy. I didn't know how I felt about anything and I didn't know how to talk about it at all. It was really difficult at first.

[01:25:33.630] - Speaker 2
Did you see that your art as therapeutic or cathartic or how did you see it at a time? And how do you see it now in that area? Your creation, your creative?

[01:25:45.350] - Speaker 1
I think it's always therapeutic, it always feels good, but it feels good because there's nothing there and then there's something there and it's something you like. That's cool. It's a great feeling. And when it goes from not good to good. It's a great feeling, like the moment when it shifts from this kind of amorphous, mediocre thing into something you really care about. That's a great feeling to addictive feeling. How is performing comedy different than performing drama, or is it different?

[01:26:20.120] - Speaker 2
I'm really happy that I started out doing comedy because I think it's made me a stronger dramatic actor. Because, you know, the importance of rhythm. Rhythm is what I feel makes something funny and pockets and placement. And for me, I feel drama is less rigid. I see laughing is dancing. There's a tune that you can say that people won't even understand me, I've done it before. When people don't understand what that can trigger a laugh in someone just through.

[01:27:02.740] - Speaker 1
The rhythm of the. Through the rhythm.

[01:27:04.170] - Speaker 2
Because that's what I found.

[01:27:06.730] - Speaker 1
Like, you're signaling this is funny. It doesn't even matter what the words are.

[01:27:12.680] - Speaker 2
That and then allows you to place what's being said in a different place within someone. And I think in drama, it's having a bit less control. And I've never really thought about this, so I probably will have a much different answer when I leave and come back. But I do think that I do do rhythmic things in drama because there is certain pockets that you think, but I'm just less beholden to the result. Yeah.

[01:27:45.590] - Speaker 1
There's also a different. The feedback mechanism in comedy is immediate. People laugh or they don't. Whereas in drama, can you always know when it's landing.

[01:27:57.220] - Speaker 2
You can feel if people are listening, if people are leaning in. It was like Luffy Vandross quote, they said to Chris Rock, he was like, anyone can make an audience scream, but can you help make them quiet? And I feel like in drama, there's a thing that there's a kind of like. That you're kind of searching for. There's like, an emptiness in the space that you are searching for when you are saying things. And it comes with, like, a fearlessness of getting straight to what you mean. And maybe that creates a vibe or something like that. There's a sound that I am searching for that just happens. And it's not necessarily to do with what people say, because when I'm set, everyone's at work that's watching what you do. They're focused on something else. So it's a sound that's away from that. There's an emptiness, that there's a silence that you're looking for that allows them know that you're in an interesting place that you can keep going in it sounds great. That sounds like a great place to very. So say, as if when I did the crime scene and get out, there was some place that we went to, me and Catherine, that meant that it was like, we're in here and people are too scared to move.

[01:29:28.040] - Speaker 2
Or it's the equivalent of, like, someone's on the floor, they've dislocated their shoulder, fuck. You want to help, but anything you do, that, like hesitation, that, like cautiousness is what's created, I think, is the only way I could describe it right now in this current moment.

[01:29:51.720] - Speaker 1
It's a very palpable, alive space you're describing. There's a void in it, is what it sounds like. There's space in it. It sounds great.

[01:30:01.650] - Speaker 2
It's like people move out the way and let the person just give them space. It's interesting because what, it will make the audience lean in, but anyone around there will lean out.

[01:30:12.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:30:12.980] - Speaker 2
You know what I'm saying? And then they just create it more space for you, then it allows it to grow out more. I think that's the void. It's like a void as collectively people just allowing it to grow. That I can sometimes feel when you're in those spaces, in them moments.

[01:30:37.320] - Speaker 1
It sounds mystical.

[01:30:41.020] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's mysterious. It can't be articulated. It's to be felt. It's like you can't describe how you dance. You can't describe why you dance. There's things that are just out of the remit of vocabulary. And I think we're so rigid in the sense that if you can't describe it, then it doesn't exist. It's crazy. Yeah, it's actually crazy. There's this stuff that you're not supposed to. And I think my family just being more, like, less western in thinking that's what world I grew up in, is that. That's what it is. You actually accept that. You know it's that, and you know that's real. You don't question it, you don't even interrogate it. It's just there. It is not there to be. I think you accept that, and that's what it was. When I was doing improv, when I wanted. When I was doing dramatic, I wanted people to be scared to talk, people watching, they're scared to cough, they're scared to disrupt that moment, you mean? Yeah, there's a nervousness that dramatic and I think comedy allows is a release. Yeah.

[01:31:52.750] - Speaker 1
Almost opposites from what you're saying, because the comedy is an energy out and the drama is more of an energy in.

[01:32:01.970] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's like contain, contained.

[01:32:07.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I take. It's really exciting.

[01:32:11.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And then that creates a kind of. I realize that I kind of create. Sometimes I'll create that space before the take to make it easier to come through, especially if I'm in pressurized situations where I have to hit it. On this one take, I'll create that move before, let's say they were rolling, and then they say, action. And I just won't do any. If I'm leading the act, first thing, I won't do anything until I feel it. Then I'll go. As opposed to using the scene to create it. I think that's what my experience has taught me. Just like, it's the guy I go in when I say we go, and it go when it hits and it feels. And then you're just in the space. Because when everyone's silent and waiting, that uncomfortability, it creates it itself creates itself. And so then you're able to just. It should be able to come to. It's just way easier. That's when I'm like, I've got one take left. You got to do it. You have to control the space.

[01:33:22.300] - Speaker 1
Also. Patience sounds like such a key piece of the process of being comfortable waiting.

[01:33:30.560] - Speaker 2
It's audacity. That's another thing about it's audacity is being silently audacious. Yeah.

[01:33:37.140] - Speaker 1
It shows confidence.

[01:33:38.380] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:33:40.500] - Speaker 1
Do you think of yourself as a spiritual person?

[01:33:45.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I do. My mom brought me up in the church. Maybe read a Bible every night. I'd read psalm and proverbs, and I think ingesting that every night meant I knew things. I remember I would say certain things, like school, and I'm like, where the fuck does that come from? No one spoke to me about that. And you're like, I think I believe in Jess and they believe something, and then. But you know what is? I don't actually know what the word spiritual means. People say it, yeah. But I think I'm in a place where. What does that even mean? I think I know what religious means. I don't believe I'm a religious because I don't go to church every Sunday. But spirit is kind. What does it mean to you?

[01:34:36.250] - Speaker 1
I feel like you feel connected to something larger than yourself.

[01:34:40.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I would say that. I would say that then if that's what's being said, I would say that if I thought about my life and my career, I wouldn't get here. And I feel like I'm being used and things are coming through me.

[01:34:57.010] - Speaker 1
That is straight up spirituality right there.

[01:34:59.440] - Speaker 2
That's spiritual, I think. Yeah, 100%. I think a lot of the things that I've done have come to me and have come through me. I've not been premeditated. I think I come from a lot of faith. What they say, delusion is faith without God. And I feel that, yeah, I think, I do think there's more than what people say. Makes sense. Doesn't even make sense to me. That's what it is. It's like, what logically makes sense doesn't really make sense in the stuff that I've seen and the stuff that's happened in my life and the stuff that has happened in other people's lives. And I do think that it's like, I'm a firm believer, like you are. Anyone that's in your life is a reflection of you in some way, shape, or form, whether you want to see it or not, because why does it stick? And so, yeah. In that regards, yeah, I do believe. What does spirituality mean to you?

[01:35:54.400] - Speaker 1
A sense of connection. A sense that there's more, that we're not doing this ourselves. There's a bigger thing going on, and we're participants or vehicles for something larger.

[01:36:10.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:36:11.620] - Speaker 1
I think most creative people can't help but feel it. It's like it's in the territory of what we do, that we experience these things that rationally don't always make sense, yet we watch these things unfold in the same way that you told the story about when you were pointing and your friends couldn't see the thing that you were seeing, and then you showed it to them by doing it. It's that same idea. The fact that you can recognize something that other people can't see. I think that's a form of a spiritual practice.

[01:36:50.580] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I know I've been gifted a level of sight in things.

[01:36:54.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Is it the nature of the story, or is it the embodiment that gets into you beyond work?

[01:37:05.060] - Speaker 2
I don't think it's an embodying. It's the intention. So it's the nature of the story. And beyond work is, like, what I interpreted my interpretation of that would be, like, beyond in your life. If we're looking at a story like, get out. Right. See, when get out happened, what happened was I was an avatar of a lot of people's feelings that they never knew that they had. And so I would walk on the street, and black women would come and hug me and leave. Just leave. Not even say nothing. Hug me. Some would cry. I was like, what the fuck is happening? And I think the strength of that narrative that Jordan built and the fact that I embodied it meant that people were receiving me as that parable, as that idea, as that concept. And then you are basically in the center of an idea, that nature that's been built around you. And because you embodied the nature that was around you, therefore everything is now projected upon you. And that sort of energy and being in different positions, because I do think story and narratives is like formation in the sports, being in different positions in the narrative.

[01:38:35.140] - Speaker 2
So if you're a villain, you're, like, in a different set of things. If you're like a supporting character, you're in a different position. People then receive you different as a product of that embodiment, essentially. And the nature of the narrative and the arc that you were expressing, and it's just something that moves to you, that litters in your life, is one thing I've interpreted.

[01:38:56.610] - Speaker 1
How would you say success is different than you would have imagined it?

[01:39:03.500] - Speaker 2
People see you less.

[01:39:05.420] - Speaker 1
People see you less.

[01:39:06.970] - Speaker 2
See you less. Yeah. There's a difference between success and recognition.

[01:39:10.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:39:11.050] - Speaker 2
They're two different concepts. That's one thing I realized. Success is like, you're part of a team. It's that you're up. This is that the other people want to be relying with success. If you are recognized, then a lot is projected upon you, a lot of people's insecurities and fears. And then you are then now like someone to be projected upon as opposed to a person. But what it does, it gives me more insight into them. And why would you say you see how people saw you? Because it's something shifted, you mean? And you see what they care about, but you know that you're not being seen in that sense. One time, and then I went to party after. Yeah, for a party for Judas and whatever. Okay. And it was the only time I've walked around with the Oscar. That shit is powerful. That is a powerful object. People are moved by it. I was like, I'm holding something crazy. It's hard to even describe. I was just like, I'm holding something that people just like, what the fuck so much is like, and you disappear. Yeah, but you are now. And I think I lived that because I've won it.

[01:40:35.100] - Speaker 2
And so people have their attitudes of it. But then I think that was the only time I really saw it clearly. Because I had it in my hand. Yes. And it was like, whoa. And so success for me has made me had to confront things in myself and to stay safe, to be clear and to keep creating. I have to let go of things to grow and still do what I do because it's just an exasperator. Just turns the volume up to eleven in every department. And I had to learn a skill in facing things and being direct in my communications. I can't be as internal as I've been. That is no longer beneficial success. It's a wild and I don't even think I've kind of really gone into it and really engaged with the spoils of it because it happened later in my twenty s, twenty seven, twenty eight and done that level. But it's a lot to. I've seen a lot.

[01:41:54.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it's strange.

[01:41:57.140] - Speaker 2
It's Od. Yeah, it's OD, man.

[01:42:01.220] - Speaker 1
It doesn't feel natural.

[01:42:04.260] - Speaker 2
I know I wanted to be successful because I was like, what's the point of doing something? I was always like that since the very beginning. But I didn't really think of all the sides of it. But I think that's what makes you go there. Because if you really thought about all the sides of it, you probably wouldn't go there. And it just becomes a thing. It's not necessarily anything better. It's just now this thing that you have to deal with all the sides of. But it means that there's a certain group of people that means that you're not as human as you once was because you now have that success. Therefore your life is. Your problems aren't really real problems. They're not going to receive it like that because of.

[01:42:47.780] - Speaker 1
And you have a different set of problems. Like when you're making something. When you're young, stakes are low now when you make something, a lot of people can see it. And now it's much more vulnerable position to be in because there's an expectation that wasn't there before.

[01:43:08.650] - Speaker 2
I've had to really strengthen my fearless muscle. The more successful I've got, I've had to really be like. And actually it's way more exposing, way more vulnerable, way more. And I've had to learn how to manage that.

[01:43:22.300] - Speaker 1
How did you meet Jordan?

[01:43:24.860] - Speaker 2
The Zoom or Skype? It was Skype. Back in the day, he'd watched Black Mirror. This black mirror episode I did. It's nearly twelve years ago I did that and he saw that and he was like, oh, this script, I'll send it to you.

[01:43:40.640] - Speaker 1
So he already had the script?

[01:43:42.570] - Speaker 2
No, he had a script. He sent me the script. And then I said, and I said, and what was at that time? I was reading the script today. I was just reading my favorite films because I was writing the kitchen. I was learning how to write, like self taught like that. So I was just reading script a day. And what I realized in that process, I learnt what I liked, and that was invaluable. So when this script came in, I wasn't acting. I stopped acting for like a year and a half, and then the script came in, I was like, that, what the fuck is that? A lot of people in my team didn't understand what it was. They were like, well, and I went, jordan was like, brother, you know, you understand. You've done the work. I know. You know. He's like, yeah. And he knew, he knew like. And I was like, this is a thing. He's like, yep. And then that was first time I spoke to him. And then Sicario came out. So the week of Sicario, I was in LA came out and then I was just in LA. I was like, it's wise for me to be here to see what it comes.

[01:44:40.600] - Speaker 2
And then the get out audition was around that time and I auditioned for it. And the first time I met him in person and he was just really supportive of me and my ideas, not my ideas, like me. He believed in what I could do. Then I did the crying scene in the audition and another other scene, I think the scene by the lake, I think he was like, yep, got roll in the room. But then I was kind of like, I've had that before. So I was like, I'm not going to believe it because it's just like, it's just too heartbreaking to actually believe in. And then it doesn't work out, so I'm like, cool. Then he met up with me again and he spoke to me about his philosophy and his ideas and how he saw cinema and film. And then I kind of was like. And it was my first lead role in a film. So I was like, asking questions about what you want. This is Danielle. But, yeah, that's how we first met.

[01:45:31.850] - Speaker 1
What was it that spoke to you when you read the script?

[01:45:35.800] - Speaker 2
I felt that shit, man. I felt like it. I felt like it, man. I was so angry, bro. I was so angry in that early stage of my life. And I think I stopped acting for a year and a half. And I remember, I knew I said, anything I do next, I'm going to go crazy. I got so much shit in me.

[01:45:59.070] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:45:59.490] - Speaker 2
And then I was so full, and then it came and I was like, wow, this is what I've realized is not a lot of things allow you to give everything. And I was like, wow, this is a space for me to give everything. And it was so angry and so concise and so articulate about its anger, and it was so anger that I think that 85% of the film is repressed anger, which I think is so honest. The straight laced nature of just having to be polite to accommodate for others feelings when people are not accommodating for yours and how that pressure Cooker goes over the top. But usually the real anchors that the fact that you let it happen, I felt that in the script, allowing yourself to be betrayed and believing in things that hurt you, I felt that. And I felt the kind of like, this shit is entertaining with it. Because for me, if it's not entertaining, what's the point? I don't think I'm here for that, to just make things as a piece of visceral art. I enjoy things like that, but I don't think I'm here to make things like that.

[01:47:23.740] - Speaker 2
I think there's loads of people that can do that. For me, it has to be digestible to people that don't understand cinema in a deep way because I'm not in commune, I'm not communicating with them. That's my friends back. And they watch french films with our friends and ask them what they think, and then I would understand what they like and what they don't like. So that's how the script made me feel.

[01:47:47.320] - Speaker 1
How is acting in a movie different than acting in front of an audience?

[01:47:52.820] - Speaker 2
Acting in the film is quieter. You're like seducing the camera. You're like, well, I choose to come in. Come to me. You can do that on stage. And there's elements, you do that on stage. But the fundamental thing is, if you're at a certain level of fit, you have to be heard by someone at the back. So there's a level of projection that means you're going to. But also the contract is different. People are leaving their house, baying a ticket, and they understand to see you in person, and they are believing that you're not you and not all the time, that the set is always there. It's like there's a level of imagination that a theater audience needs that they come with you on. While there's a level of. In film, there's a level of everything is real, this is the world and this is happening and everything's happening. And when it's not there, like, why is that not there? But if someone then double. If someone is like 24 and they're playing a baby, you not go, why is 24? You're playing a baby, you're just accepting that. That's the form and that's the style.

[01:48:56.720] - Speaker 2
There's just a different contract. I think on stage you're the editor and so you're carrying the arc and you're managing the arc.

[01:49:05.250] - Speaker 1
That's a big point. I think that's a big point with.

[01:49:08.080] - Speaker 2
The decisions that you've made with the director in the rehearsal period. And whilst in film, I feel like what I do, I see acting as helping someone say something and I'm giving you all these different ingredients and spices and styles into the stew. So when you go and make your stew go, I like that one. And then, boom, you can pick what you want. That's your choice. I'm not part of that process.

[01:49:36.040] - Speaker 1
Do you typically ask directors a lot of questions or.

[01:49:38.980] - Speaker 2
No, when I don't understand something or if I feel something doesn't make innate sense. I think a lot of times a lot of the scenes have been written for the scene and I'm a firm believer, like, what is this scene? Interrupting? This person's going to do something, so this scene happens and it's got to interrupt. He's not coming into the scene to do the scene. So when I feels like that, I feel like I will ask 10 million questions. Because fundamentally, I'm like, this doesn't really make sense.

[01:50:06.460] - Speaker 1
Doesn't make sense.

[01:50:07.520] - Speaker 2
But if I believe in it, I'm not going to ask questions. I just believe. I trust it's written well. Cool. Let's go.

[01:50:14.350] - Speaker 1
How important is it for you to believe the characters you're playing?

[01:50:20.400] - Speaker 2
What? Believe in what they say and believe in what they believe. It's important for me to believe that they believe it.

[01:50:26.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:50:27.620] - Speaker 2
If I don't feel they believe it, then I can't believe it.

[01:50:30.370] - Speaker 1
And if they believe it, you believe it because that's your.

[01:50:33.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's like, it's because you're true to them and then you can find why it's true. You know what I'm saying? It's like they believe even if it doesn't serve them. It's made me move away from good and bad and go towards what serves you, what doesn't. And people believe in things that don't serve them, creating negative realities for them.

[01:50:53.020] - Speaker 1
But they believe all the time.

[01:50:54.210] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly.

[01:50:55.100] - Speaker 1
All the time.

[01:50:55.660] - Speaker 2
But they believe in it and then there's a conviction to it and I got to know if they believe in it. Yeah.

[01:51:01.840] - Speaker 1
It's like a self limiting belief.

[01:51:03.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:51:04.960] - Speaker 1
How often does your understanding of a character change over time? Like, from the time you start a movie till the time you finish a movie? Are you 100% that person before the first day of shooting? Or does it evolve over the.

[01:51:19.530] - Speaker 2
Are you going to different scenes and you're there? I remember there's one time I play someone and then you're walking in the scene and then you're talking and you're like, oh, this guy fucks a lot of girls just because the way he's. The way I engaged with this woman and this, I was like, oh, if you're like this and you're going to indulge. That wasn't something I thought about before, but it was in the scene, it was like, oh. And then it changed. How? Then I engaged with everything else after that.

[01:51:51.990] - Speaker 1
It's really interesting.

[01:51:53.300] - Speaker 2
You could just find things go, oh, shit, this is real. But you need the experience to reveal the character. The character is not just something you've made by yourself. You find out or I find about out by myself with someone. Sometimes you need someone there to kind of reflect and go, oh, shit. I do think that. I don't know, I felt like that about dramatic acting. Yeah. I think there's know before Sunset this film, Ethan Hawke, isn't it? But the woman in the film is basically saying. They were asking like, what's God? And then basically she was like, between us. It is what exists between connection, essentially. I think that when I'm acting, it's like, if you're true and present, you find more things. That's why I don't come in there with too much preconceived notions and thoughts, because it's going to reveal more to you if you have less in the door.

[01:52:51.100] - Speaker 1
It also makes sense that the character probably knows less about themselves. People don't study themselves, they just do what they do.

[01:53:00.530] - Speaker 2
And also I have an awareness on him. He doesn't have the awareness, so it'll be incorrect for me to play that awareness that I've discovered. I'm just going to action it and I'm going to use it in a slight look. And someone that has been exposed to a man like that goes, uhoh, I know what that is. Like widows, right? Widows. I played essentially a Murderer. And it's not that he's scary, I just didn't play it scary. I played it with a lot of love. But it's the fact that he's bored. That's what makes it scary. Because then how many murders has he done? The fact that he's creative, he's made new ways. How'd you get there? It's the kind of the office nature of it makes it go, what the fuck? And then the mind goes, but he's not aware that. He thinks that's really normal. And that's what makes it even scarier. He thinks it's very normal. What else would I do? That mentality is what is like, whoa, you are down a street that not a lot of people touch.

[01:54:17.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:54:18.640] - Speaker 2
And that not necessarily going, what they say is a Hitchcock thing. Terror is not in the bangers, in the anticipation of it.

[01:54:26.690] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's the bomb that's hidden under the table that the audience knows about and the characters don't.

[01:54:31.370] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And it's just about knowing that something could happen, but not knowing what. And it's about that. Just know what I played widow is he wasn't aware that. He doesn't think it's bad. That's what's scary. He thinks he's doing the right thing, and it's like, how do you get to that belief and go, whatever, cool. And then just carry on reading a book after that? Is the fact that it doesn't affect you means that what have you seen as a kid?

[01:55:02.090] - Speaker 1
That was a fictitious character? Yes. Do you look for real world references? Not even necessarily like that. Like, do you see someone who has a certain mannerism and think, oh, I could use that mannerism in this character?

[01:55:17.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think in widows, I'm not saying what he's done was a lot of it was like, in one scene was Beanie Siegel. And I saw this video of Beanie Siegel when I was younger, I was 16, and it popped in mind of him. Petey crack was rapping, and then Beanie Siegel was just listening to him. But how close he was listening to him may goes, that's Od. He didn't understand personal space in that moment. And then they go, what's that? And I think I'll see certain things and go, what's that? Majority of time? That's, like, a rare occasion. Majority of time is people that I've seen and people I've been exposed to. And it's an energy that just in real life, that I go, I've seen that energy, and I know that energy, and then I want real life in a film. So it's people that I've actually met or people that I've been around, and people that I've seen and people that I've spoken to. Because I think the truth is way weirder.

[01:56:17.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it's the only way you can really get those. Like you say, people are so strange that if you make it up, it won't be as strange as what they're really like.

[01:56:27.610] - Speaker 2
No, you'd be too limiting.

[01:56:29.230] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:56:29.820] - Speaker 2
You would go, how did, like. It's like this, and it's more of an attitude. Remember one time I was in research for kitchen, and then this guy, he's been in the game. He's done a lot. And then I asked him one time, I was like, yo, sometimes when I see certain guys and you just know they're on stuff, you know they've done something and, you know, something crazy going to happen, I said, what is that? And how he articulated it was like, it's when they've done something they can never forgive themselves for. It's like if they robbed their grand, if they've done something that they're like that they had to do, they just can't face themselves. Right. So they're just like, fuck it. Bets are off. They've gone over the threshold.

[01:57:19.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:57:20.070] - Speaker 2
You mean where it could be as minor or as big. They violated something that they didn't want to violate. They've under, like, what that builds and what that grows into someone, what that explores, what that matures. I find that interesting. Like, certain decisions and what you've realized about your character. I want that essence in all characters I play and make.

[01:57:48.340] - Speaker 1
You said you were doing research. What does research look like for you?

[01:57:51.800] - Speaker 2
Conversations. Listening to conversations. Reading, like, dissertations. Reading around. Actually, I'd go places and I'll sit in a place and I will research in the place. So, like, rent a spot, and I'll be in the environment and I would read and I'm in it. And I could just go out in the day, come back in, like four or five, six, have my food. And then they're just in it. And it's always about being in the space.

[01:58:19.950] - Speaker 1
And you just pick up, like, subtle cues of what it's like.

[01:58:23.230] - Speaker 2
You get nuances and little detail. It's the details that make people believe. For me, it's like, you see the people that you want to articulate the things that people don't even know about themselves, that they don't even know they have it. That's what you're looking for, and that's what's real. And having something and not knowing you have something makes the character fuller, you mean? And that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for like, those little nuanced stories. How they behaved on certain kind of people. How they. Or the light. Where do they play? What do they love? Who do they love? No matter what they've done and what the character, who do they love? And where's the lovingness? In whatever they do, where's the lovingness? And I think once I find that, then it becomes intimate. It's like certain scenes, you're like, this becomes voyeuristic.

[01:59:18.490] - Speaker 1
I was going to say, are we just all hungry for intimacy? So that's why it feels so good. What do you see? A great, intimate performance.

[01:59:28.500] - Speaker 2
I think intimacy is very satisfying and an evolution in intimacy as well. I think it's very satisfying. From what I know right now, I'm open, but I would agree with that. I think that is honesty is intimate. Truth is what happened. Honesty is how you feel about what happened. That's what I've learned, how to be more.

[01:59:56.940] - Speaker 1
Honesty doesn't have right or wrong associated with it because it's how you feel. All it is is how you feel.

[02:00:05.210] - Speaker 2
But you're saying both sides of it.

[02:00:07.270] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[02:00:07.590] - Speaker 2
You're talking about the bit when you was the victor and the bit that you weren't the victor. You're being honest. You're going, oh, and that person is, oh, man, this person is vulnerable and it allows intimacy to grow. And I feel like sometimes when I find out an audience, when audiences laugh, it's not funny. These people recognize the honesty. It's a recognition of, like, oh, I feel like that, too. I never say it.

[02:00:35.400] - Speaker 1
Can you be more honest or vulnerable in a performance than you can in real life? Is that possible? Yeah, of course.

[02:00:45.900] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[02:00:48.700] - Speaker 1
That's fascinating.

[02:00:50.000] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Like I say, the contract is pretense so you can expose more of yourself because there's almost no repercussions. But what happens is that then there has to be a point where you actually do that for yourself, though. And not just do that for money or do that for career trajectory or do that for validation. You're doing it just because you want to do it and because it's the true thing to do and it's about.

[02:01:18.020] - Speaker 1
And now you know how to do it. Now you're a professional at doing that. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like, that's an incredible skill set to be good at. And the fact that it's not required for you to have done it in your life to be able to do it. It's a great gift to yourself to be able to now do it. Based on the skill set you've built.

[02:01:45.270] - Speaker 2
Outwardly, yeah, but I think I didn't feel safe to beforehand, probably in myself. I haven't acted since 2021 because I realized that I'm giving too much to these characters and I'm like. And actually, it's actually now going to do the opposite effect. I'm going to be more withdrawn, more withdrawn if I don't actually just be real as myself and just do it for myself and be real. I think I wanted to be more honest just for me, in myself, for money, not for career, not for anything else. It's just like in private, in the dark. Am I real? Are you real in the dark, Jimmy? Because then that always will come out and then it becomes easier as opposed to engineering it and having this is a safe space, because what happens is when you become more successful, you do it less. Yeah, I should do acting every week, three times a week. I do it once every few years now.

[02:02:47.220] - Speaker 1
Wow, that's interesting.

[02:02:48.880] - Speaker 2
You mean it's not like. So you don't have the.

[02:02:51.280] - Speaker 1
And do you miss it when you're not doing it?

[02:02:53.970] - Speaker 2
I miss the old version of it because you're just doing it to play, right? You're just doing it to explore. You're just wondering and there's no result to it. There's no point to it.

[02:03:04.490] - Speaker 1
Is there any version of it that you could do now that has no stakes, just for fun, that you could do just to get to do it?

[02:03:14.320] - Speaker 2
I could do. I could create a space, but I do feel like the space that was created then, it was reflective of the time as well. And I feel like it was a time when I never was honest and never was. And it was just a complete. Kind of like I'm able to exercise all these emotions in this space as, like a teenager. And I feel like I've grown as an artist that I think it'll be quite indulgent that I wouldn't enjoy it. I think now I've got to a different place and more transcendent places when I'm doing it for something bigger than me doing it to serve something doing to serve a piece, to serve an idea, to serve. And I think that getting to that place is just more enriching and rewarding, genuinely than just exploring and playing and doing. It's just a different. You just moved.

[02:04:08.020] - Speaker 1
Understood.

[02:04:08.530] - Speaker 2
You mean it's like going back to your old school? It's small now. You mean it's just that there's people. There's just. And if I created that environment I would have to create the time because the time was as important as me and the space.
