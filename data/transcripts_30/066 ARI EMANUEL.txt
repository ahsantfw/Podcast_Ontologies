[00:00:04.590] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Sunday night, wrestle, the event's on, and we were a bunch of people over to the house. We're watching, and they're like, they can't believe the spectacle of it all because it's huge. It's huge, and it's unbelievably great. Paul has done a great job. All of a sudden, Dwayne comes out with Roman, and the look left, look right. I said, it just starts all flashing back. I said, That's a throwback to Hulk, Dwayne's doing this reciprocal. I just start reciting where Roman comes from, the whole story lines, back and forth.

[00:00:58.960] - Speaker 2
The bloodline story.

[00:00:59.860] - Speaker 1
The bloodline. It's amazing. It's amazing.

[00:01:01.790] - Speaker 2
It's the greatest story in the history of wrestling.

[00:01:03.720] - Speaker 1
I started watching with my grandfather.

[00:01:06.290] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:01:07.250] - Speaker 1
Sundays, when the regions happened, Crusher and the Bruiser. Going back with Vince, I think it's 25 years, when Vince, they couldn't sell it and he started his advertising business, we were out doing that. We moved it from USA to Spike, got sued by Barry Diller, then moved it back to USA. All the different-It's such an interesting business, and it feels like no one knows about it. Well, now they're beginning to know about it.

[00:01:39.160] - Speaker 2
Maybe, but still-No, it's on a fringe. It's the biggest underground thing in the world. It's counterculture.

[00:01:46.870] - Speaker 1
It has always been. Yes, but it is when you think about it, he touched culture. He influenced culture. Absolutely. He was way ahead of culture.

[00:01:59.660] - Speaker 2
Every Every step of the way. Every step of the way.

[00:02:01.720] - Speaker 1
Every step of the way. I said it to him at one point. I said, Andy Kaufman. When you were Mr. Mcmahon and Vince McMahon, and they just constantly lapped on each other.

[00:02:15.140] - Speaker 2
The story of the creation of the character of Vince McMahon was really interesting because it wasn't intentional. No. It happened because-It happened because he had to get the ratings up and he had to have that storyline of when they were going to the extremes because you had Ted Turner there.

[00:02:28.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:02:29.970] - Speaker 2
But also because he pissed off Brett, the hitman, hard, who then spit in his face on television. Because he wouldn't give up the title. When he was Vince McMahon, exactly. Brett screwed Brett. We all know the story. But then, based on the experience in real life, he turned it into part of the show. And they always do that.

[00:02:52.200] - Speaker 1
That was his genius. Then he brings the whole family and when the Linda and the other women and the daughter. I mean, it's just the guy was one of the greatest.

[00:03:02.050] - Speaker 2
There's nothing else like that where it's scripted, but then-But then it's just free-flaw. But then real life intervenes and it gets weaved in, and the audience never really knows. Was that supposed to happen?

[00:03:16.320] - Speaker 1
That's part of being a wrestling fan is you're always watching.

[00:03:19.740] - Speaker 2
It's like, Was that supposed to happen?

[00:03:21.910] - Speaker 1
Was that real? Or was that scripted?

[00:03:25.840] - Speaker 2
When somebody gets hurt, it's like, Well, they broke their arm. Did they? Are they hurt? If you remember, Mr. Mcmahon blew up in a car at one point in time. Oh, yeah.

[00:03:37.340] - Speaker 1
How about remember when his... Was it his thigh? He blew out his whole-Yeah, in a match.

[00:03:42.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah, in a match. Yeah, for real. For real.

[00:03:44.370] - Speaker 1
Yeah. For me, when I was sitting there and I was telling everybody all the things that were going on, and when it went back and the undertaker came, I like, Here's what the undertaker was. And I was like, Oh, my God. I just have so much history theory and knowledge.So cool.It was Marty Edelman, who was a partner at the time, and I saw it. And we said, We got to sign him. And we realized it was the same thing happened.

[00:04:10.300] - Speaker 2
It was 25 years ago.

[00:04:11.710] - Speaker 1
Twenty years. Twenty-five or 26. Then Marty and I, mainly Marty, saw the star power of Dwayne that he could transition in.

[00:04:23.050] - Speaker 2
Was there a moment in time where The Rock is the biggest box office star in the world? He is now.

[00:04:27.300] - Speaker 1
He's one of them.

[00:04:28.400] - Speaker 2
That's unbelievable. Without wrestling, that guy is not an actor.I.

[00:04:34.690] - Speaker 1
Mean, I don't think that that happened.

[00:04:35.440] - Speaker 2
I don't think he would think he would be an actor without wrestling.

[00:04:37.940] - Speaker 1
But also, he's such a good businessman, and you learn inside the power of how to sell. That's what Vince taught everybody. Now, Paul's taking over the story lines, which I think are gone to another level. He's amazing. I thought this Russellmania was the best. The only one that might have been close, Andre and Hulk in Detroit.

[00:04:57.910] - Speaker 2
But if you watch it now, it doesn't I haven't watched it in a long time. At the time, it was tremendous. At the time, it was tremendous. But that was 36 years ago. It was Russellmania III. Yeah.

[00:05:11.980] - Speaker 1
Well, he needed to do that. Again, he comes up with Pennsylvania, his Super Bowl.

[00:05:20.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah.genius.genius.underappreciated.

[00:05:22.040] - Speaker 1
Genius.yeah.he's.

[00:05:22.550] - Speaker 2
Like Walt Disney.Oh, incredible.He's like Steve Jobs. It's like that.Yeah.

[00:05:26.660] - Speaker 1
No question.

[00:05:27.200] - Speaker 2
How would you say the pro- wrestling business and MMA business are different. How are they the same and how are they different?

[00:05:34.800] - Speaker 1
Well, Dana saw somebody nobody else saw. Dana is as good as it get in promotion, realizes how to create fights. And he also, over time, realized social media before anybody how to communicate. He has not leveraged that better than anybody. And then, like Vince said, wait a second, we got to go direct ourselves on fight pass and now uses social and has become a huge personality in and out of ourselves with health and et cetera, but leverages that back. And in the space, there's no better promoter in the world. And he realized it was like Friday night fights. And when that good, better, and different, I understand why it happened at the beginning, he realizes there was a space for this thing, the consistency, the product, the spectacle.

[00:06:31.130] - Speaker 2
When we were growing up, boxing was a big deal. It feels like UFC has completely usurped boxing.

[00:06:39.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, I agree. And that's Dana.

[00:06:41.760] - Speaker 2
It's a whole different thing. Yeah.

[00:06:43.150] - Speaker 1
And he understands that mechanism and what the best fights are and what you and I want to watch. Yeah.

[00:06:49.120] - Speaker 2
It's also interesting in the early days of MMA, it was Horst-Gracy, if you remember, the very first champion. And that was interesting, but it felt like it would be boring a lot because there'd be 20 minutes. Two guys would be laying on top of each other. Nobody would be moving. Then all of a sudden, one guy would tap out. The guy who was in control often would tap out. It was like, What just happened? It was hard to understand.

[00:07:11.910] - Speaker 1
But people then over time, one, got into the sport. They started training themselves. Now when you see it, I don't know how many you've come to, people understand everything going on when it's a really high-level grappling situation in jiu-jitsu, it's incredible. I think the audience understands it, too, now. It's 31 years. People get it.

[00:07:33.990] - Speaker 2
I think also Joe Rogan's ability to explain it to the audience, which he does as the commentator, that's a big part of it, too. It's like, would boxing be the same without Howard Coselle? I'm not sure. Do you know what I mean? I'm not sure. And Vince was theouncer. Oh, my God. He wasn't just writing the story or hiring the people. He was the narrator of the show.

[00:07:57.940] - Speaker 1
Remember when his father owned it? Yeah. He was the narrator. Yes, already.

[00:08:02.380] - Speaker 2
Already. Already the narrator. So he was always the person telling us the story.

[00:08:07.140] - Speaker 1
Way, way back. Yeah, forever. Before he had bought it. Yes.

[00:08:11.110] - Speaker 2
Tell me about getting run over.

[00:08:12.510] - Speaker 1
Here we go from there. It's '93, '92. I have a breakfast at Kate Mandalini's, which is like, I think, Doheny and Wiltshire. At that time, ICM was down the street a little bit. I'm walking because I'm in ICM, I'm walking to Kate Mandalini's going to cross through. I said, Wow, man, you need to get hit by a car. I say that to myself. Really? Yeah. I go to the breakfast. It's a Friday. Walking back on the other side of the street. Guys coming out of the street, flatbed small, like a Ford flatbed truck. Bang. I go, flying. Wow.

[00:08:53.700] - Speaker 2
How old are you at this time?

[00:08:55.010] - Speaker 1
34, something like that.

[00:08:56.000] - Speaker 2
You're working as an agent at this time, going back to work at ICM.

[00:08:59.790] - Speaker 1
I I had been at CAA, then this little company called Inner Talent. Icm buys the writing, motion picture and television writing division. I go over there with Bill Block and et cetera, get hit by the car, fly through. And I remember the falling. When you're up there, I was like, wow, down in my body, I'm screaming. And all I said to myself, I can't describe more than that. I said, Just wiggle your toes and wiggle your fingers just to make I'm not crippled. That's what I said. I did. The guy comes over, gets out of the truck, and he's right there. And I said, If you don't get away from me, I'm going to grab you and I'm going to do whatever I can to kill you. I I went to the hospital, X-rays. My knee was gone. My hips were all fucked up. Of course. Ribs broke in, cracked open my head. So I had to do about six, eight months of rehab because my leg wouldn't bend. At my knee. It was like... I did the rehab, had the surgery. So that was about a year to a year and a half. And at that point in time, I realized the phrase, Life's not a dress rehearsal.

[00:10:13.270] - Speaker 1
You never know. It's like...

[00:10:15.400] - Speaker 2
Anytime.

[00:10:16.090] - Speaker 1
Anything can happen. That's when I started saying, I didn't want to be at the ICM at the time. For whatever reason, bad good. I just they weren't good managers, in my opinion, the people running I just wanted to be by myself. I want to start my own thing. That's when David Greenblatt, Tom Strickler, Rick Rose, and I started building the concept of going off on our own. That was one of the reasons.

[00:10:42.120] - Speaker 2
Was CAA, Ovitz, and CAA an inspiration?

[00:10:45.650] - Speaker 1
They were still there. Mike and Roni, and Bill Habor were still there.At.

[00:10:49.060] - Speaker 2
Caa?at CAA. What was the story of them starting their own thing part of the inspiration?

[00:10:54.180] - Speaker 1
No, I just didn't want to work for anybody anymore. I realized the other concept, I realized I read this book by George with Gilder that said, Life after television. I said, I got one of the best television lists out there. There's going to be more distribution than ever. I'm going to get more TV packages. I'm going to make a lot more money than whatever they were offering me. My father almost lost his mind. I was like, What? They're offering you a million dollars? And this, that, and the other, and your packages. I was like, I'm not doing that. I think I got a shot here.

[00:11:21.230] - Speaker 2
Was it that you could make more money or that you wanted to be your own boss? Both. Okay.

[00:11:25.870] - Speaker 1
At the time, it was like, I want to make more money. I think I can do it. I I want to be my own boss. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm watching guys. And I had experience in her talent. And then I looked around and I said, There's not a lot of independent television businesses.

[00:11:41.300] - Speaker 2
Tell me your experience at each of the jobs leading up to the crash, just so I understand, what was the first real job?

[00:11:47.610] - Speaker 1
So my first job was working for this guy by the name of Robbie Lance at the Lance office in New York City.

[00:11:52.670] - Speaker 2
I didn't know you ever lived in New York City. How long did you live there?

[00:11:56.280] - Speaker 1
I moved back from Europe, where I was just screwing around. Moved to New York, applied to business school at Northwestern, got into the night school, but went to New York and worked for this guy, Robbie Lance. And so he had the Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammond Estates. Amazing. He had Milo Shorman, Peter Schaffer. I used to make copies of Amadeus with their notes. Wow. Incredible. And it was the single page. And I used to send tellexes. And I used to say to them all the time, You're the greatest writer. Take all writers that you represent, you're the greatest writer. Because I used to dictate, and he was Austrian., exclamation. These love letters to people.Incredible.Wow..

[00:12:42.030] - Speaker 2
Would they have criticism as well or only love letters?I.

[00:12:46.200] - Speaker 1
Don't remember any criticism.Okay. He was 85, and he said, Listen, I'm not growing this business. And he had Betty Davis. He had Liz Taylor.Wow..

[00:12:56.860] - Speaker 2
So he was from the old generation studio system system Hollywood.

[00:13:00.770] - Speaker 1
Him and Sam Cohn, who was the head at ICM. Yeah. Him would on Friday at lunch, I'd have to make it at the... I don't know if you remember, the tea room was the place. Yes. They would have lunch every Friday. The Russian tea room. Russian tea room. Yeah. I would make the reservation. Sam was a legend in New York. He had every theater person. He was a great agent, and Robbie Lance. He taught me, and he said to me, he was, Listen, the reason people call me back is because of the clients I represent.

[00:13:34.960] - Speaker 2
Tell me quickly the level of taste in the world at that time in that job versus today.

[00:13:41.920] - Speaker 1
Well, there just wasn't as much as there's going on right now. And when you look at Mike Nichols, Peter Schaffer, Milosh Foreman, Tennessee Williams. I mean, it's like...

[00:13:56.140] - Speaker 2
The greatest of all time, Evergreen.

[00:13:58.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and they keep on going.As.

[00:13:59.290] - Speaker 2
Important today as they were then.

[00:14:00.790] - Speaker 1
Yes. And so he had incredible taste. He read like crazy, saw everything because you could. I remember a period of time when I could see every pilot that was made and every pilot that was put up. I don't remember the date, but there was a moment in time, and I learned that from Bill Haver and Ron Meyer. I remember there was a period of time where all of a sudden, I couldn't get through it all. I couldn't get to the 150 pilots. I wanted to see what was made, what wasn't made, who started them, who was great.

[00:14:37.920] - Speaker 2
What do you think change had allowed that to happen?

[00:14:40.460] - Speaker 1
Well, then it went to six networks. Then HBO showed... I mean, It just started growing.

[00:14:46.950] - Speaker 2
And so to get-So based on the distribution, there were more channels of distribution, so more shows were made. It was just numbers.

[00:14:56.320] - Speaker 1
But that was for me on the business side, not on the creative side.That was a good thing. Fantastic. That's how I... In the first two years, we start, King of the Hill, Mike, Roni, leave the business and Bill Habor, the guys that are in power now take over. They're actually in Power now longer than Mike Owets and Ron Meyer in Power. There's a generational shift. We sign a bunch of people. Then Marty brought over David Kelly and the Turners and a bunch of people. We put on the '70s show, all of David Kelly shows. I realize, Robbie Lance is trying to make a five-picture deal for Al Pacino at Canon Pictures. Do you remember the old Canon Pictures?Of course. And he's also trying to sign a movie star that CA has. So he has Al Pacino, and he's trying to sign some actress. He's writing her love letters, and I think he's going to get her. And the call comes in. And I think Arthur Klein was Al Pacino's lawyer at the time. Tom Rothman worked for Arthur Klein, and we were in the room when they were trying to make the deal. The call comes in from Mike Ovid's, and I knew about him, really didn't know about him.

[00:16:15.540] - Speaker 1
I'm listening because you can't as an assistant. Mike says to him, You no longer represent Al Pacino. We do send over all the files. And it's the first time in my life, because I had been only in the business six months, I hear a teeny quiver because he blindsided by Mike Owens. Robbie Lance was a God to me. Yeah. I go, I got to go over there. I got to figure out what that guy's doing. Wow. So I come out for an interview. I do leading artists with Jim Berkis. Oh, cool. And then I do a meeting. Jim's still around, too. Yes. Jim's great. And he and I are friends. And then I do an interview with Ray Kertzman, who was the head of business Affairs for Michael at the time, and he ran HR.

[00:17:02.640] - Speaker 2
How big is CAA at that time?

[00:17:04.700] - Speaker 1
They were in Century City on one floor, but a big floor on Century Park East.

[00:17:11.150] - Speaker 2
How long had CAA existed at that time? Ten years? Less?

[00:17:15.530] - Speaker 1
Might have been 15 years. Okay. Yeah. He says to me, Ray says to me, which you can't say now. He goes, You're too old. I said, What? So I just do what I do. I just kept on calling him every day. And he says to me, If you can be out on a Thursday or Friday, if you can be out here on Monday, this is after three weeks of pounding him. And I had gotten back into business school at night school. You can start in the middle. Pack up, fly out. My dad Dad, he got me in the car. He said, Why don't you go to business school, get your piece of paper in his heavy Israeli accent? No, dad. I think I can. He goes, How much are you going to make? I said, I'm going to make 15 cents a mile. Yeah. 15 cents a mile. I took $1,600 Went to the Valley, bought a Lecar, red one with pullback, right? Mm-hmm.used.yeah. He said, I'll pay for the car. I'll pay for your insurance for eight months, six months, whatever.Your dad.My dad was incredible.Yeah. Started You know, had the Thomas guy. Remember the old Thomas guys?

[00:18:18.270] - Speaker 1
Didn't have wings.

[00:18:19.080] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:18:19.870] - Speaker 1
No, of course.

[00:18:20.420] - Speaker 2
Had to figure out.No, there's no internet. No. There are no cell phones.

[00:18:24.260] - Speaker 1
You get taken around for a week to how to drive on a run because they sections of the town, the valley, Malibu, Hollywood, where you're going to deliver packages. You have to pick up them, do all that stuff. You got to stay at night until all the scripts are copied.

[00:18:40.270] - Speaker 2
That's part of the mail room job is making deliveries.Oh.

[00:18:43.070] - Speaker 1
My God. Back then, you didn't text a script.

[00:18:47.090] - Speaker 2
You were more like a runner.

[00:18:48.620] - Speaker 1
No, that's where you were.

[00:18:50.250] - Speaker 2
Okay, I didn't understand. I was the mail room as more like a clerical job.

[00:18:54.180] - Speaker 1
No, you're a runner. I see. You're picking up lunches in the morning. You'd come in early and you'd get orange juice and bagels and cream cheese, and you make sure offices were clean. Oates' office was the way he wanted it with the juice in the... Yeah, that's what you did. Then at times, as you moved up the mail room off the runs, which is what you wanted, you then got to sit on desk if somebody turned in sick, get out of the mail room, but then you have to come in and copy everything until it was done.

[00:19:24.090] - Speaker 2
Then you'd work like an assistant. Essentially, you'd be the assistant.

[00:19:27.260] - Speaker 1
Then you would become an assistant in the department.

[00:19:29.580] - Speaker 2
But you started as an interim assistant if the assistant wasn't there. Correct. You got to learn essentially on the job. Right. Then I-Would anyone tell you anything? No.

[00:19:39.470] - Speaker 1
They would just sit there. You're figuring. Make calls, and they'd scream out, Get me X. You'd go through the roll of X, and you try and find X. If you didn't know how to spell it, you… Okay, they're going to fire me. I realized I wanted to be in television. I worked for this guy, David Tenser, and then I worked for Bruce Vinaker.How.

[00:19:58.960] - Speaker 2
Do you pick television?

[00:20:00.200] - Speaker 1
I just like television. I used to wake up early because I'm ADHD, and I used to watch television. I love television.

[00:20:06.180] - Speaker 2
I just loved it. Growing up, what we are watching, listening habits, everything.

[00:20:10.480] - Speaker 1
So I would get up at 5:00.

[00:20:13.250] - Speaker 2
Every day?

[00:20:14.160] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I don't know. I would be watching whatever was on in the morning, mainly on the weekends. And then at night, when I came home, it was The Monkeys. It was I Dream a Genie. It was like...

[00:20:26.820] - Speaker 2
Like, swinging 60s.

[00:20:27.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It was Gilligan's Island. Great.

[00:20:31.350] - Speaker 2
I love all the shows.

[00:20:32.380] - Speaker 1
Same. Monster's. Monster's. I'm trying to figure out there was-Flinstones? I was a big Flintstones. There was a space show on Sundays before wrestling. I don't remember what it was. I used to love that show. It was so badly done. It was so good.

[00:20:48.930] - Speaker 2
Like science fiction? Yeah, science fiction.

[00:20:50.280] - Speaker 1
So good. Then I have to go to Sunday school. Then I became an agent for those guys, and Bill Haper was there. Every Friday, he'd play his violin. It was really fun. That's cool. It was great. He was great. That was cool. He was incredible.

[00:21:06.440] - Speaker 2
You have to admit there are a lot of interesting characters in the entertainment business.

[00:21:11.180] - Speaker 1
A lot more before than now. Yeah.right?yeah.a lot more.

[00:21:16.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah, just interesting people.

[00:21:19.380] - Speaker 1
Like, crazy.Odball.Odball.Interesting.Incredible. Then saw the Mike Ovid's rise to power.

[00:21:29.020] - Speaker 2
Who was the first client you signed?

[00:21:31.650] - Speaker 1
The first client I signed was, I think it was Amy Lippmann or John Veedie or Greg Daniels. It was in that group. I think it might have been Amy Lippmann that did Part of Five, and she had a writing partner, Chris Guise. Or it was Greg Daniels, he had a writing partner.

[00:21:47.610] - Speaker 2
In television, you're still working mainly with writers or no?

[00:21:50.950] - Speaker 1
Only with writers.

[00:21:52.380] - Speaker 2
Only with writers.

[00:21:53.620] - Speaker 1
Here's how you would do it. You would go to... Like Trace Yeoman was being filmed and The Simpsons came out of it. So you would go to the set on Friday night at Fox. Jim Brooks would be down there doing The Tracey Elman Show. And then there would be all these writers writing these little skits. And I wanted to sign them. And I was told I couldn't sign them by Lee Gabeler. I had a service list, and I serviced the list, but I wanted to sign some writers, going back to what Robbie Lance told me.Yeah. And so I did it.

[00:22:25.520] - Speaker 2
Did those writers in Jim Brooks's room have agents or no?

[00:22:28.810] - Speaker 1
They did. And then I realized a lot of these people were coming from the Harvard Lampoon, and then they would go to SNL, and then they would go. So I went to the Harvard Lampoon. Harvard Lampoon. Yeah, and get them early. Now, there's thousands of places to find writers. So I went to the Harvard Lampoon and then SNL, and then they would transition. So that was that. And then I realized about two and a half years in, Bill Block, Judy Hufflin, David Greenblatt. I don't know if Mark Rosen was part of that group at the beginning. He came in afterwards. They started intertelling. They broke off and started intertelling from ICM and from CA.

[00:23:06.960] - Speaker 2
And that was just a little indie group?

[00:23:08.750] - Speaker 1
That was that group. Then Tom Strickler, who was a friend, went over. And then I realized they had just moved from Century City into that. Remember that place they had on Wilcher and Little Santa Monica? Yeah.right. That was the thing.Yeah, the I.

[00:23:24.900] - Speaker 2
N. P. Building.

[00:23:25.520] - Speaker 1
I remember walking over to that building.Beautiful building.It was incredible.Yeah. And they did a whole ceremony. It was crazy. I was like, first we started at Jimmy's. Do you remember old Jimmy's in Century City? We walk over and there was this whole ceremony. I was like, okay. And people were totally into it. I was like, we've entered the cult. I'm not a cult. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I said, I got to get the fuck out of here.

[00:23:49.930] - Speaker 2
Wow. That's interesting.

[00:23:51.450] - Speaker 1
I was like, what are we doing here? We're blessing the ground. And I got Mike's whole thing. Mike Schtick is incredible. And the most in a positive way.

[00:24:00.690] - Speaker 2
Yeah. No, he believes what he's doing.

[00:24:02.560] - Speaker 1
That's why it worked for him. Yeah. He was committed. People were committed with him. They had the license plates, CAA, BV, CAA.Is that true?Oh.

[00:24:11.850] - Speaker 2
Yeah.i didn't know that.Yeah..

[00:24:13.580] - Speaker 1
Then Bill Block and David Greenblatt, who I knew from CAA, and Thomas Strickler recruited me, and I said, Yeah, I'll do. Left and started their lit department at Intertalent. Three months in, four months in, maybe, I don't know. It's right around there, writer strike happens. I'm like, there's a small agency. They were on top of sunset in that building where Soho House is.9,000.

[00:24:45.570] - Speaker 2
I think. Something like that.

[00:24:46.010] - Speaker 1
And I called my dad. I said, I'm definitely getting fired. He goes, What did you do wrong? I said, No, I didn't do anything wrong. There's a strike. They're going to have to save some cost. I'm the new guy. I'm dead. They didn't fire me. Nine months. They didn't fire me. And then staffing season happened. I went buck wild on staffing season. It was fast. Staffed everybody. Then they moved to Rodeo Drive in the old Drexel offices. They had started to grow. Then they sold. The talent department with Patrick and David Schiff and Judy Huffland went to UTA. What? Bauer Benedict and leading artist merged and called UTA. They went there. That's how the company got brought up. And the lit department Bill Block went to ICM.

[00:25:31.930] - Speaker 2
Why would it get split?

[00:25:32.760] - Speaker 1
I don't remember. I was a pimple on the ass of an aunt at the time. And so we were there.

[00:25:36.930] - Speaker 2
Why did they decide to sell?

[00:25:39.180] - Speaker 1
I think Bill Block realized, looking back at it, remembering Whispers. The chemistry wasn't right. I see. No disrespect to Judy. Judy wanted a certain talent, a client that wasn't commercial. Not in a bad way. Great actors. And there wasn't the confrontation that It needs to happen when you're in a partnership. No, we're not doing it.

[00:26:03.340] - Speaker 2
There were different visions.

[00:26:04.420] - Speaker 1
There's commerce also.Unresolved.

[00:26:06.240] - Speaker 2
Different visions.So.

[00:26:08.130] - Speaker 1
That happened.What was next?Car accident happens. Ari Lee starts his firm.

[00:26:13.960] - Speaker 2
Tell me the story of Endeavor.

[00:26:17.650] - Speaker 1
Tom Strickler, David Greenblatt, Rick and I, car accident, we're talking like, We can't do this. We can't do it. We can't work for them anymore. Greenblatt was always a rebel. The guy's got unbelievable guts. We convinced Rick Rosen. We made a fake budget of how much we were going to make that year. A complete fraud. Here's what this one's going to go. Because Rick still had people in school. He had to pay for school. We didn't take salaries for two years.

[00:26:45.310] - Speaker 2
Is there any budget that's not a fake budget?

[00:26:47.990] - Speaker 1
No, they're all-It's all gas. It's made up. For sure, at the beginning of a company, you think, Here's what this one's going to be.

[00:26:55.690] - Speaker 2
It's always so odd to me that people make something up, and then everyone It's like it happened.

[00:27:01.270] - Speaker 1
Tom Strickland and I made one up. With Joel Mandel, our business manager at the time. We got a loan from Russell Goldsmith. Joel secured that unsecured because we didn't have any.Yeah, there was nothing to secure it.For a million dollars to start doing stuff.We were at the...What.

[00:27:21.400] - Speaker 2
Would you spend money on?

[00:27:22.830] - Speaker 1
You had to get copy machines. You had to pay infrastructure. You had to get the phones, all the...Yes. We then bought furniture from flea market.Of course. Then we just started. I thinkAnd did you bring clients with you or had nobody?

[00:27:39.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah, we brought clients.

[00:27:40.110] - Speaker 1
Eric Gillland, Amy Lipman, Greg Daniels. We signed up, I think, Our first client, before Marty came over, our first client before Marty came over. Our first client was Bob Singer, Big Hot writer at the time, one of the great guys. We got lucky. We got King of the Hill on the air, which was a package.What.

[00:27:58.000] - Speaker 2
A great show.Right? The best.Great show.

[00:28:00.230] - Speaker 1
People were great to us. Like the old Brandon Tartuff talking about characters, one of the great guys. We start the company. He takes us to him. He goes, We're going to breakfast right away. Meet me at the time. Remember, the breakfast area at the Four Seasons was the place to be Boom. And there was bad people, too. But there was people that stretched and said, We believe. I mean, the guys at ICM, that they took the press that we left and blew it up. We were four schmucks. And they made us this huge thing that we… I mean, I had the clinics all over the place that we were nothing. Nothing. They sued us for nine months. Wow. Breach. We settled. We got 90 cents on the dollar. Made our career.

[00:28:50.370] - Speaker 2
Was there any mission statement or organizing principle beyond, We don't want to have a boss?

[00:28:55.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was it. That was it. Distribution is going to expand. We're going to get to... There's going to be more product needed.

[00:29:03.480] - Speaker 2
You saw the opportunity. Yeah.

[00:29:05.600] - Speaker 1
That was it. Not that that wasn't a big deal, but-No, no, no. Yeah. We have a new one now, but... Yeah.

[00:29:12.500] - Speaker 2
Then tell me about the history of the William Morris Company. What is William Morris in the entertainment business?

[00:29:21.220] - Speaker 1
Well, it's over 120 years old. Like, MCA was The Company. When we took it over, their original offices, they gave gas to employees. They had drivers. It was insane. They started the packaging business. It was the founding agency, not that there weren't, in the business, and it had lasted over 120 years. And it just kept on going. I don't remember all the leaders of the place. You remember I mean, if you're a student of the game, you remember Lou and Jules Stein? Yeah. But when we looked at it, going back to when we were going through this, we did something at Harvard analyzing the business. How do we make it a two-horse race? At the time, it was CA It was CA, was Mike and Roni and Bill left that brand, which was the best brand, and gave it to these guys. I mean, again, you realize just in life, what they created, it just keeps on going. They He did the dine out of it.

[00:30:31.290] - Speaker 2
Mike went to Disney. Is that why he left?

[00:30:33.080] - Speaker 1
At that time, Mike, Roni left first.Yeah.He went to Universal.Right..

[00:30:37.400] - Speaker 2
And he ran Universal ever since, ever since. Until recently.

[00:30:39.290] - Speaker 1
And then Mike then had to leave because Roni left before. That was the whole thing. Then Mike went when Michael Eisner had the heart attack, I think, he went there. And then Bill just left. He did the theater business and et cetera. And between, I think it was Jack Rappke and Rick Nesita and the guys that are now running it, ran that business. I think Doc O'Connor was in that group. They've run it for 26, 27 years. That place has been around for... It's very hard to put an agency out of business.

[00:31:17.770] - Speaker 2
William Morris was the granddaddy of the whole thing. You'll hear interviews with actors in the 1930s talking about, call William Morris. And in the 1950s-It was the brand. It was the brand. It was almost shorthand for agent.

[00:31:38.370] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and I think they went... We got lucky because it had taken a downturn. They had a great agents in there. They had a book business that was great. They had a music business that was great. They had a non-scripted business. They had a great motion picture and television. It just wasn't managed.

[00:31:54.950] - Speaker 2
Did it get too big for what it was? Sometimes old businesses-I don't want to talk ill of people that ran at the time that we came and merged with it.

[00:32:02.980] - Speaker 1
These things, you have to manage them. You have to make sure everybody's working together. You can't be afraid to fire somebody. God forbid, you have to. You have to manage the process. And if you're not willing to manage the process and you don't have big enough clients, you can't threaten me. I can step into that situation. No problem. That was one of the problems I faced with IMG, which is different. I can handle a nonscripted. 99% of the jobs I can do, I have done. So you're not going to threaten me like, okay, lock yourself out. Except for the first year that we merged. That's a different conversation because it was '08 and the world was changing.

[00:32:43.430] - Speaker 2
Tell me about the idea of the merger, and how did it end up being Endeavor? Because you would think in any version of anyone who knows anything about history would say...

[00:32:57.430] - Speaker 1
It should be William Mars.Of course. That's right. It is William Morris & Dever.Okay.Okay. The parent company is WME. Wme. Yeah. Okay. I won't tell you why we got there. Patrick and myself, I don't remember who else was in there, we went to Harvard Business School, and we met with the then-You didn't go to Harvard Business School. To meet with a professor. At the time, that professor became the head of Harvard Business School. At the time, Professor Nitten was not. He gave us the courtesy of walking us through the business plan. And we laid out for two days on a whiteboard, the business, see as the dominant player. It was ICM, William Morris, UTA, and us. And we laid out a plan. We have to go after William Morris. And here's why they have a music business, they have a theater business, they have a commercial business, they have a book business, they strengthen a movie business, and they strengthen their television business. And then it would be a two-horse race.

[00:33:55.490] - Speaker 2
Was there a second option or no?

[00:33:57.160] - Speaker 1
Well, the second option was ICM, and then ICM sold to this guy by the name of Suhal Rizvi and made the worst deal in the world. They gave him his packages, and they could have banked the packages and gotten the money. Stupid. And UTA was much of the same, not in a bad way. They just had assets that we had. If you believe that distribution is a commodity. We didn't have other areas where distribution was going to go.

[00:34:20.600] - Speaker 2
The fit wasn't as good.

[00:34:22.040] - Speaker 1
It took us five, seven years of taking clients, taking agents, attacking.Wow..

[00:34:30.450] - Speaker 2
William Morris.William Morris.Wow..

[00:34:32.820] - Speaker 1
It fits and starts off happening. There was some really bad meetings that Patrick and I walked out, and Patrick looked at me, Well, that's never going to happen. I said, Yes, it is. I was the obnoxious one, of course. Really?

[00:34:43.510] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I find that hard to believe.

[00:34:45.810] - Speaker 1
And then we wore them down, took a bunch out. It was not at the top of the place they weren't getting along. And we got to the people that wanted to do And then everybody got to the table. It took a year. And then at the end, as our friends at Harvard told me, there's no merger. There's somebody wins and somebody loses.Wow.And so here's the battles. Fight for the name, give up the name, but win. Business affairs, communications, CFO, da, da, da, da, da, da. We just followed that game panel, and we did it.Amazing.And so we took people off the board that didn't deserve to be on board, put people on that then were loyal to us, not to them. From their side. It's because they were dysfunctional, not because we were geniuses.

[00:35:34.570] - Speaker 2
No, completely understood. It also was new blood. Sometimes a younger upstart brings a different energy to an old organization that ends up being good for everybody.

[00:35:45.240] - Speaker 1
And they wanted it. But the craziness, it was '08. People don't remember the world. We were all going over the edge in '08. The world was coming to an end financially. People had bought 19 houses. Yeah. And so they made $20 million less they thought. We had to give $20 million of bonuses to keep everybody in line because they were guaranteed, as I remember. I might be wrong, but I think so. And we lost... William Morris had a lawsuit on a building that we lost for 35 million. So we were at $75 to $100 million. In '08, we had to beg for a loan to keep to Russell Goldsmith to keep the dream alive. Yeah.

[00:36:26.930] - Speaker 2
Why was making it a two-horse race important?

[00:36:30.230] - Speaker 1
Icm was, because they had sold their assets, nothing. I mean, they were nothing. So it was UTA, small, British, compared. And then it would just be us and CA. And then when you're talking about signing clients, We had all the divisions they had. All we had to do is now organize them, make sure they work together, realizing that the business was turning to television with everything coming. And we thought we could compete at that level because we had a better motion picture writer-director business then, actor business, TV business. You wanted to tussle? We'll tussle. Before, we were a small agency. We tussled. We were a small agency. Now, we have every division, actually more divisions than they have in the theater department, in the book department. Really big. Our commercial down and bigger. Like, Okay, you want to play? Let's play.

[00:37:21.890] - Speaker 2
How long did it take to sort out?

[00:37:25.020] - Speaker 1
Until about 2011, 2010. Two years. Two years to organize it, let people go, keep people there. And then two years to get it really going. And then in 12, Teddy Forgeman passes away from IMG, who was a friend of ours. And we had started this company called Raine, which is a merchant bank, with Joe Ravich and Jeff Sein. We were raising money. He was on the cover of Forbes. I called Mark Andreessen, who had just started his VC fund. I said, I want to meet you.

[00:38:06.900] - Speaker 2
You didn't know him?

[00:38:07.780] - Speaker 1
Didn't know.Cold called him.Cole called him. After reading the article, I said, I'll fly up. He says, No, I'll fly down. He flew down. He told me what he was trying to start and why Ovis was advising him at the time. And he had a vision of that. We talked about my business. And I said, Listen, I got this merchant bank. I want you to put in some money. So he put in money, him, Egon Durban from Silver Lake, their friends, and Nikesh, who was at Google at the time. They had a separate little thing.

[00:38:34.970] - Speaker 2
Did you call him because you saw the-Similarities. And the synergy in-I read articles now and I call people if I find them or it interesting. But Is money money? Do you take money from anyone?

[00:38:48.740] - Speaker 1
No, I just thought he was interesting. I just thought he was... He saw an industry, he went against trend, and he was trying to build something against trend, an establishment. I said, I want to know that, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I then met Egan Durban from Silver Lake at that point, and he and I started talking. He had bought Skype. He and I would have lunches every once in a while, and he buy Skype, and he calls me up and he says, Hey, I think this should be some content animation on Skype. He sees what I see. At least that's what I thought. It didn't happen. We hadn't raised the money yet enough money. I wanted to put Rain into Skype. And he was the younger guy at Silver Lake at the time. He then sells Skype, his first big deal to Microsoft. Thinking about it, Skype could have been WhatsApp. In two seconds, that was thinking back, Microsoft could have made it WhatsApp. Blue it. And then he calls me when Teddy Forceman dies and says, Can I come down to see you? And I'm trying to raise money in my head. I'm flying all over.

[00:39:51.250] - Speaker 1
I went to Brazil to see Ike Batista, Martin Sorel at WPP at the time. I'm trying to put the money together because I want to go after that because I want to I have sports now in the business.

[00:40:03.350] - Speaker 2
Would that have been the first big acquisition? Yeah. Okay.

[00:40:06.300] - Speaker 1
Because the William Morris thing only cost me to let people go $40 million. It was nothing. That would have been at the time. A big deal. Yeah, a lot of money.

[00:40:17.930] - Speaker 2
Tell me about that business. Before you got involved, tell me about the IMG business.

[00:40:23.460] - Speaker 1
Well, IMG had events. They represented about 150 sports, from Snooker to darts to tennis.

[00:40:34.730] - Speaker 2
Who was their competition? Nobody.they were just the sports.It.

[00:40:38.480] - Speaker 1
Was octagon a little bit.

[00:40:39.900] - Speaker 2
But they were the big sports player.

[00:40:42.160] - Speaker 1
That business had been around for 60 years when he'd passed away.

[00:40:47.380] - Speaker 2
Did you always think sports would be a good piece? Yeah.

[00:40:50.010] - Speaker 1
Because it was-Since when? I thought about this for a long time, this concept that got built.

[00:40:55.600] - Speaker 2
A long time starting when?

[00:40:58.270] - Speaker 1
When I started in '93, '94, when I looked at maybe a little earlier, that here's where the world is, I thought about how you're going to discover stuff. You got to have marketing in there. I didn't realize what social was going to do, but social is that marketing arm. 30 years, 35. Five years. So I'm out raising money, and Egan calls me up and he says, Listen, I want to come down and see you. I got an idea. So we go have lunch at the Grill. And he says, I want to invest in you and I want to go after IMG. I said, Listen, dude, I've been talking a lot of You're a PE firm. You're never doing this. You just can't get around running an agency and money. He goes, Show me your numbers. I come back down in three weeks. Showed him the numbers, came back down in three weeks. I could have signed the original agreement, but I went over with our friends at Harvard, our lawyer. We negotiated, made a deal like three weeks later, it's been the greatest relationship ever. He's back to every play. Amazing. Yeah. And he's not one of the promise we made him was most people come to Hollywood on their private planes.

[00:42:14.200] - Speaker 1
They leave on American Airlines. We promised them we were never going to lose them money. Have not. And it's just been incredible. And then we were in the bidding for IMG. I moved to Europe for four or five months in the summer. Every three weeks, come back for a weekend with the kids in the summer. Met everybody. It was the representation business, the production business, the events that they did, and just started building the business. And then that then started fitting in, and they had a licensing business. They had a lot of pieces. And at the time, when you saw it, the studios, probably music, too, television companies were abdicating a lot of their responsibility. And we then started building things things that we could do internally when you had a book division. And then we realized we do all these things for people, and we see businesses that if we owned, we would do this and that. So half the business should be things we represent. But if we owned it, here's where we could take it. So then half the business was that, and then we went after things we could own.

[00:43:23.460] - Speaker 2
When did that start, the idea of ownership? That's a big change.

[00:43:26.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that was Brent Richards. I remember he presented at Wimbledon, 2014, I think it was.

[00:43:36.570] - Speaker 2
That was recently. I mean, 10 years. Yeah.

[00:43:39.320] - Speaker 1
And so the first one we went after to own, we owned some events, and then we bought some events. And then the big one we bought, we made a leap. We bought Droga5, the advertising agency. But then the biggest thing we really bought, we bought bull riding. We turned that thing around, and it's going great now. How popular is it? I don't know anything about it. No, it's popular.

[00:44:07.100] - Speaker 2
That's great. And we created-Is it popular just here or is it popular in other places?

[00:44:11.120] - Speaker 1
Brazil, Latin America, China, Australia, There's pockets.

[00:44:17.020] - Speaker 2
And is it local or?

[00:44:19.380] - Speaker 1
All over. It goes to Manning Square Garden, comes out here, goes to the South, Canada.

[00:44:23.880] - Speaker 2
But the same guys who are popular are popular in all those places.

[00:44:27.250] - Speaker 1
Actually, the biggest players in bull riding, not that the riders are not popular. They are the Bulls. Really? Oh, yeah.

[00:44:34.590] - Speaker 2
Because they're the wildest bull riding the Wildest Bull.They're.

[00:44:37.210] - Speaker 1
The stars.Yeah.

[00:44:38.570] - Speaker 2
That's interesting.

[00:44:39.740] - Speaker 1
Turn that around and then cut our teeth on that about owning something and high sponsorship teams and all that crap and built a sponsorship group, which took a lot of time. While managing these people that, like I said before, I could step into a book business or non-scripted. Not be perfect in all of them, but I could handle them. I don't know anybody in Italian soccer. I don't know. I mean, they had me over the barrel until I learned that business.

[00:45:15.580] - Speaker 2
Is there an advantage in the synergy? When you got sports-Well, then you realize you're going into ESPN and Disney, and you're selling them X TV show, X movie, and you want English Premier League, or you want X XYZ.

[00:45:30.880] - Speaker 1
That was the advantage. You have a lot of fingers in. Then when you own something, you see what they're spending on across it, and then you're like... Then we did that, and then UFC came up. I had represented them for a long time.

[00:45:47.360] - Speaker 2
What's good about it is by representing them, you get to really learn the business.

[00:45:50.690] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I learned the business. I saw the business and realized the business, and they had created an incredible thing, and Dana was growing, and it was great. So The guys wanted to sell. Reza and Frank, Fatida. I talked to Silver Lake, and I said, We have to own a sport. Multiples in sports are going to go up. Back then, nobody thought like, What?

[00:46:16.820] - Speaker 2
What made you think it was going to go up?

[00:46:20.200] - Speaker 1
Again, when you looked at the ratings in television, all sports were up there, both. So you knew. And then S Passpots were coming, meaning the Netflix of the world, that was growing. So it was inevitable. And you had the rumors of other people getting into the space, more distribution, price elevation. I had a long history with Dana. At the time, it was a crazy multiple. Crazy. It was like 22 dimes. But we had a thesis that Fox couldn't give it up because for their station group, they had all of our Our library. They needed because of the broadcasting and the ratings he was getting. And cut to Fox, raise their hand, we're selling. They can't bid. Espn can't bid. At&t wanted it also for TNT. John Stenge wanted it bad. And Trump stopped that transaction from happening. So that was off the table. Nbc didn't want it, and Paramount didn't want it, even though we started a paramount. He started on Spike. So we were shit out of luck for like nine, 10 months. I mean, it was bad.

[00:47:37.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And you had you already paid 22 times?

[00:47:42.410] - Speaker 1
Oh, we paid 4.2 billion. So I put all the chips on the table. And clients were in it. And we had nothing. And we were like, I think it was like three or four months left on our deal with Fox, and we had nothing. Then the ice broke with ESPN. They wanted to go direct to consumer. Dana says this all the time. The guy running ESPN was just shining me out all these years about making a deal with the Oasis. He never wanted it, thought it was like a bad sport. Yeah. Beneath that. Yeah. He gets kicked out for drug-related issues and other things. Iger saw it because he came out of boxing. He realized it. Like, right away, Bob realized it, and Kevin Mayer realized it for direct to consumer, our guys buy pay-per-views. It's going to be good for us. We We make the deal. And it's a funny thing. It's a long story. But we were in Paramount trying to convince them to make Spike back to the sports channel. And I get a text or a WhatsApp from Kevin Maher, and I think, yeah, Kevin Maher. We have a deal. And this is after many backs of-Wow.

[00:48:48.350] - Speaker 1
I slide my phone over to Shapiro, and I end the meeting. I said, We got to get out of here, Mark. We got a meeting. We get in the car. Jimmy Vittar, who's unbelievable, Bob Iger, and Kevin Maher are in the plane, flying to New York, and we're making a deal over WhatsApp.

[00:49:09.080] - Speaker 2
Amazing.

[00:49:10.050] - Speaker 1
And Bob, to his credit, Dana Nead wanted, instead of eight episodes, 10 episodes of fight night on ESPN because that's how you make stars. Still, broadcasting is important. They were on the 8. And God bless Bob Iger. He goes, Give them the two. Great. We got a deal. And then our The first night, fight was in Brooklyn. Blew the doors off. And they were unbelievable partners in promotion. Incredible. And then they bought the fight. Then they bought the pay-per-views.

[00:49:42.630] - Speaker 2
And so there was-Hypothetically, That's a critical question. Now, going forward, is there a time when it makes sense for UFC to have their own network instead of being on ESPN?

[00:49:55.070] - Speaker 1
I would say I thought about this. Is there going to be a period of time when Direct Consumer, they are the most incredible because you still... Even though we all pooh-pooh linear, NFL is unlinear, the NBA deal is going to be linear, a portion direct to consumer, hockey is going to be linear.

[00:50:15.150] - Speaker 2
How did the last deal work with Peacock? Was that good for Peacock? No, great. There was the WWE Network.

[00:50:21.930] - Speaker 1
No, they have that. I call those the PLEs. Okay. They have that, Primero Live events. I think it's at four or five million subs to Peacock. That's a huge number. I need to run the math on it. It performs. But we're going to see. We moved from Fox to NBC.NBC?Smackdown was at Fox. We took that and we moved that to NBC.NBC?

[00:50:52.460] - Speaker 2
Broadcast, NBC?No.

[00:50:54.630] - Speaker 1
I want to say NBC. Usa Network. Usa Network. There's shows, specials that will happen On the network, on NBC, in that deal, which are incredible for us. I see. Breaking stars going down. We took the CW-Nxt that we were getting nothing for. Sold that for a great number.

[00:51:13.070] - Speaker 2
And Nxt has grown into a serious third brand within WWA.

[00:51:17.030] - Speaker 1
It's amazing. That is compared to what Dana created when he created the Contender Series. And then we had raw. Everybody killed us because we didn't make a deal for raw. We had raw, the stock market. And Mark and I had an idea. And nick Khan, at a breakfast, I started with Bella this concept. Before I'm making the NFT deal, I thought I could get her into Nxt. And then once she realizes this is where she was incredible, she realizes, wait a second, this audience moves wherever it goes, it moves. This audience moves. You go to Spike, everybody moves. You go back, everybody moves. You go to Fox, everybody moves.

[00:51:59.040] - Speaker 2
Dedicated fan base.It's incredible.

[00:52:01.220] - Speaker 1
And gross. Every year. And so she realized, wait a second, the overlap, we could gain a ton of subs here. And it's a lot of programming, and it's global, a global fan base. And so she got it. Once we showed her the numbers, number one for 24 years in a row, so she got it. Ted got it right away and made the deal for Raw.So.

[00:52:30.320] - Speaker 2
Raw will start on Netflix in January? Yeah. It's a big deal.

[00:52:35.210] - Speaker 1
Huge. It's a big deal. And so nobody saw that coming. And now we have the PLEs, which everybody wants because of how many subs it has. And so we feel good. It's all going.

[00:52:48.620] - Speaker 2
What was the thinking in putting UFC and WWI together and spinning it off as TKO?

[00:52:56.280] - Speaker 1
I was getting frustrated We weren't getting any value. I said, if we could have a pure play, we should trade it more, move that over. We're bigger than them financially, so we would get majority. We can consolidate it back in. And made it pure play.

[00:53:14.360] - Speaker 2
When does it make sense for a business to be public? And when does it make sense for a business to be private?

[00:53:20.720] - Speaker 1
Here's what I have learned, and it took me three years to learn this. I don't think this is not a fault of anybody. When it's a clean conversation and the story is simple, I think people get it. Back maybe '70s, '80s, conglomerates people got, and that was the story they believed in, and the GEs of the world, all those guys, they believed that, and they could sell that story. A simple story I think people get. At least that's what I understand. And yeah, I think that's why that thing should be public, and this other thing shouldn't be public. It never.

[00:53:55.550] - Speaker 2
Does it change anything in the day-to-day running of the company or nothing? Nothing.

[00:53:58.890] - Speaker 1
Same thing. I've been doing the same thing, whether it was inside or whether it's outside. We have incredible executives across the team. Everybody plays fairly and well in the sandbox, or they have to deal with me and other people.

[00:54:15.560] - Speaker 2
In some ways, in the agent business, you're always accountable to someone already. Do you know what I'm saying? It's the nature of the business.

[00:54:23.060] - Speaker 1
That's one of the great things about being an agent. It actually teaches you an incredible skill set for investors. Dealing withDealing with people, all that stuff. It's incredible. It's actually incredible. So that's been the great... Over the 29 years, 30 years of doing it, that skill set, if you can deal with agents, If you can deal with actors and writers, directors, you can then deal with investors and public markets. It's just part of the process.

[00:54:52.140] - Speaker 2
Do you work with some of the greatest creators on the planet?I think so.You do. What do creators understand that traditional business people don't?

[00:55:03.250] - Speaker 1
The great thing about great creators, they believe in their vision, and they will do anything to follow that thing to the end. They'll go do anything. Great ones listen to people in their own way, not that they'd make their adjustments to get to where they want to be because they have this burning desire to tell that story. Whatever it is, music, theater, they want to do this. And that ability... Because remember, when you're doing that, you got to take a lot of punches because there's a lot more nos than yeses. Yes. And so I think they have a lot more endurance because they have this love, passion, vision, and they have to tell their story. And I tried to tell my kids, and I said to my agents, Being a CEO is not how many punches you throw, how many you can take. And that's what creatives, right? I mean, I don't know what you feel when you're doing music with people. It's a lot of just... What did Tennessee Williams say? Writing is rewriting. You got to really grind.

[00:56:09.600] - Speaker 2
You got to grind.

[00:56:12.260] - Speaker 1
And it doesn't just like...

[00:56:14.180] - Speaker 2
It does justIt doesn't just-Sometimes it just happen. It doesn't just happen. Sometimes it just happens, but then you have to make sure that when you're grinding after the special moment, that you don't ruin it. It's delicate.

[00:56:24.270] - Speaker 1
It's super delicate. It's super delicate. They know that and that they still get into that ring and do it. It's incredible. That's why I love them. As much as it's sometimes frustrating, and I think I frustrate them. Larry David has a vision, man. Eric Sorgan has a vision. Jim Brooks has a vision. I mean, Greg Daniels' vision. Mario Scorsese's vision. They have Michael Moore vision, and they're just, Let's get into the ring. That's a hard thing to say. I want to get in the ring and be naked in front of people. This is what I'm going to go do. And people saying no to you.

[00:57:00.940] - Speaker 2
And that's what it is. When you have a crazy idea- Too many. And you're excited about it, how hard would someone have to argue to get you out of the idea? Or is it even possible?

[00:57:14.980] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Here's what I say to, and this is why my partnership with Mark Shapiro is incredible. I have a lot of ideas, and I've learned over time, 90% suck. But there's 10 that really are good Good. The one thing they know is-And does he help edit?

[00:57:32.220] - Speaker 2
Is that how that works?

[00:57:32.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah, he helps edit. He's really good at the edit.

[00:57:35.160] - Speaker 2
Is there any time where he says, Don't do it, and you say, We're doing it?

[00:57:38.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I say something like, No, we got to try this one.

[00:57:43.300] - Speaker 2
Is it just that the vision is It's clear.

[00:57:46.410] - Speaker 1
No. You want to know something? I'm okay with his arguments why it shouldn't work. I'm okay getting into the ring and trying to make it work because I think it's more important for the try. Because also, I don't know if you learn this in your life, success doesn't just go straight up. It's a squigly lying down to the left. It's a roller coaster ride. It's all. And in that, it's like what I said to you. I started with Joe and Jeff Raine. I met Mark Andreessen led me to Egon Durban. We tried to do something. It didn't work. The lines of how you got to where you are, they're all... Sometimes it's important to get into the ring and not get it done, but it's going to lead you to three other things that create unbelievable opportunity. And so sometimes I sit there and say, and I just do it in my head like, I'm not sure where this is going.

[00:58:39.080] - Speaker 2
Yeah, something's going to come from it. Something's going to come from it.

[00:58:40.870] - Speaker 1
Something's going to come from it. And the hard thing is when you're dealing on Wall Street, Or with PE sometimes, and this is what's great about EGON, they let you go down that street, even though, how's your pencils? That's rare for a PE firm, CEO, difficult Wall Street.

[00:59:00.710] - Speaker 2
No, they expect a certain...

[00:59:02.470] - Speaker 1
They want the straight line.

[00:59:03.520] - Speaker 2
It doesn't work that way.

[00:59:04.530] - Speaker 1
It's impossible to work that way. It's impossible.

[00:59:06.870] - Speaker 2
What are your thoughts on cancel culture and free speech?

[00:59:10.590] - Speaker 1
Cancel culture and free speech. Well, I cannot stand what's happening in these schools. Campuses right now. I don't understand it. King Jeffrey said to me, In the Gaza Israeli situation, there's Goliath and David. In the greater Middle East, Israel is David, their Goliath. I don't think they understand when you say from the river to the sea. They don't even know what the river is. Actually, there's a Jordan River. The sea's over here. That means no Jew would be there. That's genocide. I don't think How did he realize that. That's the frustrating thing.

[00:59:47.650] - Speaker 2
The lack of information, just how ill-informed people are.

[00:59:52.320] - Speaker 1
I'm going to get more likes if I say it this way. That's what your life's about? I don't understand it. I think Bill says it right. He says, They are hurting the Democratic Party and the Republican Party hate, woke more than they hate Russia. So they'd rather be with Russia because they hate that more. John Stuart said that one, and he's right. It's so ill-informed. It's shocking to me.

[01:00:22.740] - Speaker 2
Do you think there's going to be a World War III anytime soon? No. Why do you think no?

[01:00:26.960] - Speaker 1
I don't go there. Okay. Because Because if I go there, I'm not getting out of bed. I like getting out of bed, and I like working, and I like doing what I do, and I'm trying to make the world a better place.

[01:00:36.110] - Speaker 2
When did you get serious about exercise and biohacking?

[01:00:39.360] - Speaker 1
I always worked out. I started intermittent fasting I was playing ice baths 13, 14 years ago, 15 years ago. Then it just... It's on a steep incline of the craziness. I always pick up the phone because my brother Zeke is a doctor, and I just say to him the following, Here's what I want to do. Could it hurt me? And he says to me, yes or no. And if it's a yes, I don't do it. If it's a no, I do it. So if you do those things right, You got a better chance of living long. I don't want people to go, Oh, you want to live forever?

[01:01:20.190] - Speaker 2
No. You want to be healthy?

[01:01:21.330] - Speaker 1
I want to be healthy.Of course. Right. And so I love my life. I have a great life. I worked really hard at my life. And so I just want to enjoy it for as long as I can and be around to see what the hell fuck happens because it's as interesting the world as it's ever been. I think if you ask people, 1969,What happened in 1969? It was a big concert. Remember that concert that happened in New York? Yeah. You know what also happened then? What? You had the flu. It was a 1969 bad flu. 120,000 people died.

[01:01:57.390] - Speaker 2
Same time as Woodstock.

[01:01:58.560] - Speaker 1
Woodstock? Oh, yeah. I didn't know. Parents That sent their kids to Woodstock. Yeah. You had Nixon. You had Vietnam War. The world was coming to an end. Now, we'll figure this one out, too. Yeah.

[01:02:13.370] - Speaker 2
I'm going to list a couple of biohacks You can tell me which ones you've done in a hop. Okay.criotherapy.oh, yeah.

[01:02:18.790] - Speaker 1
I do a nice bath every morning.Okay. Hyperbaric oxygen.Yes..

[01:02:23.310] - Speaker 2
You're at a meditation practice?

[01:02:24.960] - Speaker 1
I meditate every morning in my sauna for 25 minutes.

[01:02:28.230] - Speaker 2
Great. What style of meditation is it?I.

[01:02:30.110] - Speaker 1
Have a... A mantra? A mantra.

[01:02:33.240] - Speaker 2
Out loud or internal? Silent.

[01:02:35.160] - Speaker 1
Silent. And then after that, during the day, I do a... There's this guy, Brian McKenzie. I do an incredible breathing. I do about a 15, 20 breathing.

[01:02:45.590] - Speaker 2
What time do you go to bed?

[01:02:49.180] - Speaker 1
10, 10:30. Wake up about a quarter to five, five.

[01:02:53.220] - Speaker 2
I'm going to say four qualities, and I want you to prioritize them for me. Enthusiasm, work ethic, smarts, instinct.Can I add one more?Yeah.

[01:03:07.090] - Speaker 1
Endurance. Endurance is the number one thing.

[01:03:10.650] - Speaker 2
Number one?

[01:03:11.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:03:12.730] - Speaker 2
Is that part of work ethic or it's different?

[01:03:14.810] - Speaker 1
I don't know. It falls under maybe it's A, B, and C. Endurance, enthusiasm, work ethic, I think are in one group.

[01:03:22.450] - Speaker 2
Okay. Right? Instincts. Instincts before.Yeah. Then smarts.

[01:03:25.800] - Speaker 1
Instinct before, then smarts. I mean, hello. I remember having to go to China for lunch. I went to Abu Dhabi to get that relationship way before anybody else 20 times.Wow. Yeah.

[01:03:47.730] - Speaker 2
That's brutal. Yeah. Is there anyone that you feel intimidated to talk to? No.not a person on the planet?No. Was there ever a time that you felt that? No.not a person on the flat?No. Okay. Do you think pretty much anything can be worked out if people talk about it?

[01:04:08.700] - Speaker 1
Yes, I really do. Me, too. I had this conversation with Martin Lau from Tencent, who I went to China for lunch for a while, and one of the great guys runs Tencent. And I said to him, I wish... Because if it was up to us to do business, we could do business. We do business, and it's good business. I'm not really sure about the country situation. I don't really understand why that can't be figured out. I'm not a religious person. I believe in how you have to treat people. That's like religion, about that stuff. And I just don't understand it.

[01:04:42.250] - Speaker 2
Do you believe in God? No. Do you pray?

[01:04:45.960] - Speaker 1
No.

[01:04:46.660] - Speaker 2
Are you spiritual in any way?

[01:04:50.420] - Speaker 1
No. I want to treat people right. Of course. But I mean, I don't...

[01:04:58.020] - Speaker 2
That's a separate thing.

[01:04:58.820] - Speaker 1
That's a separate thing. How are you defining spiritual.

[01:05:01.030] - Speaker 2
Do you feel connected to something greater than yourself?

[01:05:04.160] - Speaker 1
Do I feel connected to something greater than myself? Yeah. I want to believe I do that there's some...

[01:05:11.400] - Speaker 2
Well, you either do or you don't.

[01:05:12.410] - Speaker 1
I'm not sure I'm a spiritual There's no right answer. I don't think I'm a spiritual person. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.

[01:05:19.180] - Speaker 2
At least not yet.

[01:05:20.350] - Speaker 1
You're going to get me there.

[01:05:21.670] - Speaker 2
Whatever. Have you found joy outside of work?

[01:05:25.090] - Speaker 1
Yeah. How? Well, I find incredible joy in my relationship with my wife. Great. I feel incredible joy in my relationship with my kids and their growth and everything else. I love now surfing, as you know.

[01:05:43.270] - Speaker 2
How did you come to surfing?

[01:05:46.230] - Speaker 1
My wife said, Let's go to Costa Rica. I said, Really? She goes, Yeah. She goes, You're going to love it and you're going to learn how to surf.

[01:05:53.350] - Speaker 2
Have you ever done anything in the ocean before? No, not at all. And you grew up in Chicago. There's no ocean.

[01:05:59.030] - Speaker 1
But when we went to Israel every summer, we went into a walk. She got me out there, got wiped out tons and tons of time, but I'm competitive. Then I got one. I got a wave, and it was like...

[01:06:16.610] - Speaker 2
This is it.

[01:06:17.280] - Speaker 1
This is it. It was like when I first started golfing. I signed this guy, Chris Thompson, who was one of the great writers. He took me out to Lakeside. Summer, July, I'm in a suit, pick up a club. Never golfed before. Shanking, shanking. Hit the ball right on the screws, as they say. Sold.wow.same thing with surfing.That's.

[01:06:40.420] - Speaker 2
Beautiful.yeah..

[01:06:41.140] - Speaker 1
And I just love it. If you know anything about golf, I'm a 15 handicap, which is not a very good handicap, surfer.

[01:06:47.220] - Speaker 2
But you love surfing? I love it.How great is that?Yeah.And it's a new passion.Oh, yeah.

[01:06:53.420] - Speaker 1
There's a surf ranch up here. I cannot wait two days. And you just get better.
