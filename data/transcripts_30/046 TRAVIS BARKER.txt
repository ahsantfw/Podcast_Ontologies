[00:00:08.490] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammatin. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:22.770] - Speaker 2
The way the story is told to me is I was like four years old, and I was banging on pots and pans constantly to the point where my mom said to my dad, I think he's a drummer. And then they got me, like, this little animal drum kit you could get from whatever toy store. And I played that every day.

[00:00:43.020] - Speaker 1
Did you play just by yourself making noise, or did you play along with music?

[00:00:47.180] - Speaker 2
Sometimes with music like, my mom loved the Beatles. She loved, like, Elvis Presley, so I would play along to those.

[00:00:53.890] - Speaker 1
Was there always music playing in your house?

[00:00:55.910] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no musicians in my house, but music constantly playing in my house.

[00:01:01.440] - Speaker 1
Were both your parents into music?

[00:01:03.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah, my dad was more into, like, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson's still his favorite artist of all time, Buck Owens, stuff like that.

[00:01:13.590] - Speaker 1
How did your mom and your dad meet? Do you know?

[00:01:16.060] - Speaker 2
They met at Bob's big boy diner? Yeah, my dad grew up in Pennsylvania, came out to LA. My mom was working at Bob's big boy and, yeah, the rest is history.

[00:01:30.750] - Speaker 1
Do you have brothers and sisters?

[00:01:32.090] - Speaker 2
I do. I have two older sisters. Yeah.

[00:01:35.090] - Speaker 1
What was it like being the youngest?

[00:01:37.160] - Speaker 2
I was an accident. I wasn't supposed to happen.

[00:01:39.790] - Speaker 1
How much older are your sisters?

[00:01:42.190] - Speaker 2
Like seven and nine years older.

[00:01:45.080] - Speaker 1
Okay, so you were a long way away.

[00:01:46.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I was an accident. My dad says the story kind of goes, like when they came to the doctor and they had said, I think I'm pregnant. He was really upset. I told you guys not only, I think, because income wise, my family didn't have a lot of money or anything, the doctor was kind of scratching his head, like, what are you guys doing? Told you idiots to stop. But there was no question they were going to have me. But, yeah, it was cool. My sisters were old enough to have different musical tastes and be into different things than I was, so I could hear whatever music they're blasting. They're listening to Janet Jackson records, and I'm kind of learning to play along to those, too, as well as whatever I'm into at the time. And both were into singing and dancing when I was a kid. So my parents did their best to make sure we were always busy with something.

[00:02:43.330] - Speaker 1
Also, you got to grow up in a house, both with your parents music, which was from an earlier generation, and then from your older sister's music. So you got a wide variety of music. It's great.

[00:02:52.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it really was. My dad also listened to jazz that would be like. Remember being six or seven and around that time they had figured out, okay, he's for sure a drummer, or he's really serious about this, or we want him to be serious about this, so let's get him to start taking lessons. So we would drive to Hemet from my house, which was like, I don't know. Sometimes with traffic, it might have been an hour and a half.

[00:03:16.240] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:03:16.900] - Speaker 2
And we would just listen to chick Korea or just jazz stations. So that was also just pushed down my throat, but I really wasn't into it at the time. I was into a lot of different music, obviously, but my appreciation for jazz now, I'm so thankful. I was on all those long car rides wherever we were going, listening to whether it was jazz or Willie Nelson or Johnny Cash.

[00:03:43.100] - Speaker 1
When you started taking lessons, what was that like?

[00:03:45.360] - Speaker 2
My teacher really focused on sight reading because locally there was these competitions where you'd go and you'd sight read against other drummers, and I could just nail it because I was just a bookworm. My teacher was really strict. My instructor was really strict. So it was a lot of that. And then reading charts.

[00:04:07.050] - Speaker 1
What were the things that you like to read?

[00:04:08.770] - Speaker 2
It was like syncopation, stick control, all these things. And then, okay, learn everything in syncopation with your left hand on the snare and your right playing like a jazz pattern, then vice versa. Left hand playing the jazz pattern open handed, and your right hand is answering all the snare notes.

[00:04:27.500] - Speaker 1
And how old are you?

[00:04:28.230] - Speaker 2
Stuff like that.

[00:04:28.650] - Speaker 1
At this time that you were doing this?

[00:04:30.300] - Speaker 2
I'm, like seven or eight.

[00:04:31.930] - Speaker 1
Wow. So it's really early. Yeah.

[00:04:33.900] - Speaker 2
It was really creating and building my independence as, like, a drummer and just shaping me because I would know how to play jazz, I think, to now in whatever music I'm recording, or if it's just, like, even a blink song, like doing something weird. This latin pattern I learned when I was nine, it's really helpful, and it helps me have, like, a distinct sound. Not on purpose, but just organically.

[00:05:04.270] - Speaker 1
Seems like most of the best rock drummers have a jazz background, and it's not always apparent in the way they play, but there's some subtle sophistication in the grooves.

[00:05:15.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah. To me, it's like you might hear that drummer who you're describing. Maybe they have really great ghost notes or just their approach to how they play a rock song versus just a rock drummer that's only played rock music. It's so funny. There was just something that happened the other day, like, one of my friends who. They run, like, this really popular site called drumio and it's like, just everything. Drum and he sent me. It was, like a new song that I produced on the new album, and it's called one more time, and it's a ballad. And I actually produced this song out about seven different ways. One that had big instrumentation and real drums and guitars, one where it stays pretty normal, like the same throughout the whole song. And what it is, is the lyrics and the melodies are so touching. And what he's talking about is so profound and special. It was like anytime I put all this instrumentation on it, it actually take away from the song, even though sometimes whoever I was in the room with, they're like, yeah, this is awesome. This is awesome. But when I put on the version that just had brushes, bass guitar and piano, people would cry.

[00:06:33.730] - Speaker 2
And I played the other version and I wouldn't get the same reaction. So I think it's like knowing when not to step all over a song. And I think you learn that in jazz, too. You have your parts where. Yes, set up this accent that's on the e of three, whatever. And that's called for. But the other parts, like the trumpet player is doing a solo or the guitar player is doing this melody or someone's singing and, you know, not to step on those. And I had to explain it because he sent me this version. He's like, what if it sounded like this? And I'm like, it's funny. I made a version like this. No one cried. And then I made this other version where I just played brushes on, like, a 1938 black beauty Ludwig, and everyone cried. And it's also, I think, people, for me, it's like, why isn't there crazy drums on it? Why aren't you spazzing on the song? I'm like, well, it's not called for. That's not what I'm supposed to do. It's actually a disservice to the song, and I don't want to do that. So I think learning how to do that was from jazz and then relearning it is now being a producer, and I have to block out what people expect of me as like, oh, why aren't you going crazy on this song?

[00:07:43.020] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm thinking about that feeling of obligation because you're known for a thing.

[00:07:47.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I would go to studios sometimes and they're like, we want you to go crazy. We want Travis Barker on here. I'm like, okay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll overplay here if you really want me to. But doesn't feel right to me, but I'll do it. And I actually have learned to be like, okay, it's okay to live a little here. This is a bridge section. It's musical. Could flex right here, do something cool that's musically interesting. But I think the majority of my career is, like, once I started writing or producing or recording, I think I was more reserved and more laid back, and I had to be told, like, hey, we want you, and kind of, like, let me off a leash a little bit. And I learned to do it again. But I think my first instinct is to lay back.

[00:08:35.100] - Speaker 1
So much of the sound of blink is associated with bombasts to the drums, but it makes sense in that context because that's what that band sounds like.

[00:08:44.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah, completely, 100% correct. Like, we're a three piece. Tom doesn't love guitar solos. He never wants to play a guitar solo. I generally write all the bridges to all of the blink songs. That's usually a place where they're like, trav, do something weird. Trav, we came up, we'll get in the studio, we'll all jam, or I'll present an idea for a song, and then we get the verses, choruses finished, and then my job has always been the bridge of the song and kind of the arrangement or whatever. So I always have had this freedom most drummers don't have in a band, and I wouldn't normally take in any other project, but they've always given it to me, and Blink's always had that. The drums are like. I don't know, the drums are kind of loud in blink songs, too. Almost like how you hear them in almost like rap music or electronic music.

[00:09:38.620] - Speaker 1
That's part of what makes Blink Blink.

[00:09:40.310] - Speaker 2
It's not broken. I'm not going to fix it, of course. And it's been cool and it's been really fun for. I don't know, just to let blink be influenced by all these other things, because I did listen to punk rock, I did grow up listening to punk rock, but also was raised on rap music and jazz music and drum and bass. So being able to express myself and include that in a band like Blink has been so exciting and fun.

[00:10:06.470] - Speaker 1
Tell me the thinking that goes into, we have a verse and a chorus, and now we need to do something different.

[00:10:12.290] - Speaker 2
I guess I always want it to be somewhat of a departure to a song. It depends if it's a musical bridge or a vocal bridge, if it's a vocal bridge. I'm very mindful of what melodies are going to be saying over it. If it's just music, then it's different. Like, oh, cool. I'm going to experiment with this drum and bass part here, and I'm going to put really cool 909 drums as accents in it, and I'm going to be really experimental.

[00:10:39.280] - Speaker 1
Might you ever do a tempo change or. Rarely.

[00:10:42.190] - Speaker 2
Sometimes we'll slow down a couple of bpms for a bridge and then come back for choruses or something like that. Or there's a song on the new album that's, like, in seven, eight and four four in the bridge. It goes in between, and it happens in a way where it doesn't make anyone trip or stutter or feel like, whoa, whoa, what's happening here? The untrained deer, they're like, oh, cool. To a musician, they're like, whoa. Seven, eight and four four. And I feel like that's when you've succeeded integrating an Od time signature into a song. I think a lot of things are natural for me. Sometimes I'll put on the song and I'll go in and I'll just to listen in context, hear the verse, pre chorus, chorus, if there is that arrangement. And then I'll just play into something, and then a lot of the times I'll be like, okay, let's come up with music in this part. Do we change the progression slightly in this part? Do we make it anything? So it's like a breath of fresh air, and it's kind of an answer, or kind of like that part of the song that complements the verse in the chorus or is like, I don't know.

[00:11:53.580] - Speaker 2
Does something different for the song takes you somewhere else?

[00:11:56.280] - Speaker 1
How does a blink song come into existence? What's the first thing that happens in the group?

[00:12:01.220] - Speaker 2
It could be anything. It happens so many different ways. Like, on this new album, it could be a start that Tom has, and he's just like, I have this riff. Then we'll get together and we'll come in and I'll really kind of push him to be like, let's just jam.

[00:12:15.730] - Speaker 1
Would you say jamming typically an aspect of the songwriting?

[00:12:19.610] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It could either start, like, for edging. That's, like, on the album. It was our first single on the album. We released way before the album, and I just said, like, a shuffle is so powerful. If it's done right, it's like, bounce.

[00:12:33.210] - Speaker 1
Started with a feel.

[00:12:34.100] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it could start with a feel. So I started with that and then just said, jam. Don't think about it. Let's just jam something. And then it's pretty normal for Tom to be like, okay, that was cool. I'm going to go. And I'm like, no, just get on the mic really quick. Just do whatever comes to you. It doesn't have to. Don't think about it being permanent to.

[00:12:51.210] - Speaker 1
Get him to just freestyle over the jam.

[00:12:53.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll do something on the drums where he's like, oh, that's cool. I never thought of that. Whatever. I like this. And if he's interested in that, then I'll get him to just play guitar over it, come up with some ideas, and then I'll do that for a couple of ideas. And then I'll find these snippets of things that I really, really love, that I think are special. I'm like, go in there and just give me any melody, whatever that you have or whatever comes to mind. And then from there, so it starts.

[00:13:17.080] - Speaker 1
With a big aimless jam. And will you loop it?

[00:13:20.850] - Speaker 2
Well, usually from that jam, we'll usually have an a and b part. I will loop it to where there's verse, chorus, verse, chorus.

[00:13:26.470] - Speaker 1
From the original, or do you play.

[00:13:27.890] - Speaker 2
It again from the original?

[00:13:29.390] - Speaker 1
From the original, yeah.

[00:13:30.580] - Speaker 2
And then come up with some kind of lyric or melody. We'll sit there and mess around with that, and then from there, go rerecord stuff if we need to.

[00:13:38.970] - Speaker 1
Usually we do been like that from the very beginning.

[00:13:41.120] - Speaker 2
I mean, from the very beginning, we were never in a studio. When we'd write, we would go in a room and we would write the entire song in a practice room.

[00:13:48.560] - Speaker 1
Like a live band that didn't record, essentially.

[00:13:50.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Up until our untitled album that was written in a house, in a studio, as we went.

[00:13:58.640] - Speaker 1
When you would write in the rehearsal room, would you be playing loud?

[00:14:02.100] - Speaker 2
Loud, yeah.

[00:14:02.800] - Speaker 1
Could you always tell? Yeah.

[00:14:04.450] - Speaker 2
It's so weird to think back that things happen like that, but, yeah, a lot of those things, too, would come from jamming at sound checks, being on tour, because we were tour all the time, and it's those goofing around noodling that we'd be like, that's something. And then isn't it a great feeling when you'd like the best?

[00:14:25.190] - Speaker 1
There was nothing before, and you're messing around and it's not serious, and then you recognize something really serious. Yeah.

[00:14:32.800] - Speaker 2
I mean, even to this day, when I go in the studio and do that, when you go into a studio, like, if we came here and then we had a session and we leave with something, and we're like, so exciting. That didn't exist before, we were here today. That's so exciting. So, yeah, we used to do it like that, and now that I think back to it, it's wild that that's how songs used to get written. Yeah, I think it's really important for a bunch of songs to start a bunch of different ways on this album. There was times where it's the first time I ever produced a blink album. I'd always help with arrangements or do whatever I was supposed to do or come up with ideas. Like, we should do this tempo. Everything shouldn't be a punk rock boot. We should try other things. And I think this time was the first time where I would come and I'd present actual song ideas. And it is a challenge being in the band and then also producing the band. But I felt like I was so aware of what the challenge was. I had really sat around and thought about both scenarios and was able to really think about meaningful, profound things that we would write about that were really, really sincere to our band.

[00:15:45.250] - Speaker 2
Like, writing about how dysfunctional our band is, or it takes one of us to almost die for us to get back together or to record an album or to tour. So I feel like writing stuff like that and really touching on those kind of sensitive subjects were so powerful with this album because we lived through it, our fans watched us live through it, and just the most humiliating times of the band, like, we've written about. And I think it's just been so cool for us to share that with them and then also be able to relate to it. Yeah, just be really freeing rather than going in. I've been in a lot of sessions. I used to just kind of be like, yeah, I'll be in the room. I'm down to be in this session. I'm down to do whatever. And I would see some sessions where it's just like, we're just trying to write a hit song. The subject matter and the concept of the song has nothing to do with an artist, and those are not as special. And don't hit me like these ones do. And I didn't even know songs got written like that until I was in those kind of rooms.

[00:16:57.510] - Speaker 1
It's strange to me, too.

[00:16:59.000] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I know it works, and I know a lot of people do it, but I know it doesn't resonate with me.

[00:17:07.690] - Speaker 1
Tell me about blink from the beginning, was the band already existing when you joined?

[00:17:12.110] - Speaker 2
Yeah, they were around for probably a good, like, five or six years at the time when I had heard about their band, I was in a band called Feeble it was like a punk rock band. I was a trash man in Laguna beach, and we were just playing locally, and we would see their name pop up in fanzines.

[00:17:30.070] - Speaker 1
Just as a fan, would you go to every punk gig? Yeah.

[00:17:32.240] - Speaker 2
Where I grew up, we had Spanky's cafe, we had showcase theater, the Glass House, the barn.

[00:17:40.280] - Speaker 1
And what were some of the bands coming through when you were a kid?

[00:17:42.820] - Speaker 2
I saw everyone from inside out to the Dickies, like, played shows with the Dickies with my punk bands when I was a kid. Agnostic front bands like no doubt were playing at Spanky's before they were big, the Misfits, everything, basically. Before. Before I joined Blink, before I moved to Laguna to be a trash man, I was living in the Inland Empire. And I went from playing in punk bands, doing little tours here and there, to, like, one of my dearest friends still to this day is a guy named Bill Fold, who now owns Coachella with Golden Voice. But he started off this little crew of people called 98 Posse, and they put on shows in the Inland Empire. They put on every show. If it was a rave, if it was a metal show, if it was punk rock, rap, whatever. So I grew up, like, ticketing, doing whatever, passing out flyers for him. Whatever he needed, I'd do anything that he asked of me in return. I got to see every band I wanted to see and every band I didn't want to see. And it was a beautiful thing. I was just around music.

[00:18:46.870] - Speaker 1
And at this time, punk rock was underground again. Punk rock had its moment with the Ramones and the Sex Pistols and those bands. Then it had another moment with Dead Kennedy's black flag, first wave of american hardcore. And then it was kind of quiet.

[00:19:04.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah, you were just going to, like, punk shows at little venues. 800, 500 theaters. That's basically what it was. Unless he would do a Misfits reunion show or he would do whatever, some big ones that we would see. But, yeah, that's kind of like what? I was around a lot, and then I was about to give up on Music. I just turned like 17, I think I just graduated high school.

[00:19:30.390] - Speaker 1
What were you going to do? Give up music to do what?

[00:19:32.310] - Speaker 2
Well, my pops had told me. My pops was in the military. It was like a biker, very great father, but very strict. And he had said, like, look, if you're going to be here at the house, you got to pay rent. You got to work 60 hours a week plus, or you can't be here. You got to pay rent. You're not just going to play in the garage with your friends. Like, play drums. So I was like, damn, maybe I need to do what Pop said. Maybe I need to join the military. Yeah. I don't know. We didn't have anything. And I was like, man, maybe I should just stay home and help pops out. And I was playing in this band called Feeble at the time, just kind of playing with whoever I could play with. And I called the singer of my band. I was like, look, I think I got to get this job. I got to help my dad out, got to pay rent. I think I'm just going to stop playing drums full time right now and just focus on a job. And then he was like, golf, phone me, call me right back.

[00:20:25.550] - Speaker 2
He's like, no, but I go, no, what? And he's like, I don't think so, man. I think, I can't let you do that. If you want to come crash on my couch in Laguna beach, I'll get you a job at the city. You could try to get you a job being a trash man like me, whatever. But I think most it was life changing for me. He changed my life. And he was like, think you're too talented? Just give up on drumming. You can get this job any time of your life. You are going to regret this if you don't do what I told you so, packed my stuff, went to Laguna, slept on the couch.

[00:20:57.740] - Speaker 1
Did you tell your dad?

[00:20:58.890] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:20:59.240] - Speaker 1
And what did he say?

[00:21:00.580] - Speaker 2
I mean, I think luckily my dad was kind of like tough love. It was like, well, go figure it out. He was also encouraging. And it taught me because I really couldn't just sit there playing in a punk band, playing in the garage or doing whatever I was doing. So I left. To me, I made it because my aspirations weren't too high. They were only, can I play drums? Find a way to live and eat.

[00:21:28.040] - Speaker 1
Survive.

[00:21:28.770] - Speaker 2
Yeah, survive. And I was like, I'm going to do it. I'm going to figure it out. So that was a lot for me. It was liberating. So I moved out there and trash man played in feeble.

[00:21:40.980] - Speaker 1
Did people already realize you were good?

[00:21:43.540] - Speaker 2
I mean, I didn't really know. I mean, of course your friends gas you up. There was like a crew of older kids that skated in the neighborhood and they had a half pipe, and I'd always want to go skate over there. And the only way they would let me skate over there because I was younger and I was kind of like a grom compared to everyone else. They're like, you got to learn master of puppets, front to back, if you want to skate the ramp, and we're going to come over and watch. So I'd be like, okay. And I'd learn it. And it kind of got me into hanging out with the kids I wanted to hang out with. Like, oh, I can go skate now. And of course, I loved skating. I was so passionate about it. But then I started around this time, also right before this time, I had learned I'm way better at drumming than I am skateboarding. I love skateboarding, but I suck. I'm not as great as I think I am. I'd learned, like, whoa, my drumming gets me into to skate with these kids I want to skate with.

[00:22:31.790] - Speaker 2
And then when I started playing with feeble, we really started playing out a lot. And that's when we would play shows with other bands. And then that was like, how there was a band called BHR, and the bass player of that band was also in the Aquabats. And he saw me play, and he's like, dude, I'm blown away. Your band's good. You are sick. You should come play with the acrobats. So, like, okay. Like, two days later, they had a show at the glass house with Fishbone. And I'm like, yeah, I'm there. I love Fishbone. Are you kidding? Like, I think it was, like, fishbone and skeletons, whatever. So I learned all the songs, showed up, played that gig, played with the acrobats, recorded and wrote with them, like, the next album. And then that led me to be on tour, and we were on tour with the Alcoholics, primus blink. It was called Snowcore tour. So I did that tour, and I was just, like, killing it. I was obviously playing every day, and I would just have a blast. That was my favorite time, was playing drums.

[00:23:35.910] - Speaker 1
First real tour you went on.

[00:23:37.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, acrobats had done a couple, but that was a big tour. And then after that, we're on tour and we're doing one offs with blink. And I was the kind of kid that would show up, set up my drums, play all day until they would tell me to shut up for sound check, put my stuff on stage, play some more, and then I would play any chance I got, practice pad in the band, I'd make the most of it. My dad worked really hard, and I think that work ethic, I really just kind of applied to myself and what I did.

[00:24:08.590] - Speaker 1
Tell me what practice looked like also.

[00:24:10.720] - Speaker 2
So I'm playing, like, weird sambas and bosanovas, and I'm playing marching stuff, because I was also in marching band, so whatever. I felt like that day, I remember I'd be on tour, and the drummers would be like, what are you doing?

[00:24:23.750] - Speaker 1
Would you be playing two music or.

[00:24:25.250] - Speaker 2
Just not just practicing? Yeah, just coming up with cool rhythms or just jamming. And then on the bus, it would be just a practice pad, and I'd be playing paradiddles, flams, herthas, like, whatever I just had in my head from marching band.

[00:24:40.010] - Speaker 1
How many hours a day would you think you'd be playing?

[00:24:42.390] - Speaker 2
Probably in the van, like, a good two or three. Yeah, if we were traveling and I wasn't driving. Yeah, two or three. So then we're on one off days. It was like. I think it was blink madness. Aquabats, someone else. And we were all on tour together, and it's like an hour before the show, and I see the blink guys, and I would watch them every day, because, once again, I had known them when I was in feeble, and I'd seen them playing around the same places we were playing, but they were already more successful. And then they came to me, and they're like, yo, Trav. And we had been friends. Our drummer just bailed on us. We have a show in 45 minutes. We're not going to be able to play if we don't have a drummer. So I went in the room, learned, like, 20 songs in, like, 40 minutes, played the next three shows with them, and had a blast. It was, like, kind of what I grew up doing, because I was in the Aquabats playing, like, sca, new wave Deboesque music, and those shows were so fun. Came home. I remember I came home and I made, like, three grand.

[00:25:44.260] - Speaker 2
It's a lot of money for me at the time. I came home to my dad, and I was like, dad made three grand playing three shows, and he was like, you better save it. You're probably not going to make that much money again. I was like, okay, whatever way to motivate me. But it actually was motivating.

[00:25:59.510] - Speaker 1
Sounds like he's, like, grounded and realistic.

[00:26:01.990] - Speaker 2
Yeah, he was. And from where I come from, it's really humble beginnings. No one ever did anything. I grew up different. Like, most of my friends were in gangs, and just nothing was going on. I had been in scenarios where parties would get shot up or my best friend's house got shot up when I was inside of it, like, drive by shootings. I knew enough from growing up where I did that. This isn't for me. I'm not even glad I saw it. But I'm like, wow, I witnessed this.

[00:26:33.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You understood. This is something to escape.

[00:26:36.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I was so happy I grew up playing drums, and I was so happy I had that. And I might go out and hang out with, like, knuckleheads, but I always knew, like, damn, I'd see more and more. That's not for me. This isn't for, like, this is not what I want. So when I did come home and I said, dad, I made this money. And he said that, I was like, okay. And then around that time, blink was telling me, we really want you to play drums with us. And I said, well, you have a drummer. If anything ever changes, I would be honored, flattered for the opportunity. So I wasn't sure what I was going to do. I was playing in the acrobats. I was living with Bill Fold, who did 98 posse and ran all these shows. I went out to Detroit and I hung out with suicide machines because they were looking for a drummer. Detroit was really different than where I grew up. I couldn't skate. I couldn't do much. It was snowing the five days I was there, and I'm like, man, what do I do? I came home and I got the call.

[00:27:29.710] - Speaker 2
First show is tomorrow, San Diego. You're in blink. And then from there, it was just constant touring.

[00:27:40.200] - Speaker 1
When you joined, what was the scale of Blink? Like, what were the places you played? If you were to do a headlining show in different places of the country, how many people would come?

[00:27:50.410] - Speaker 2
Probably a thousand. Yeah, it was.

[00:27:55.180] - Speaker 1
Were some places bigger than others?

[00:27:57.050] - Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure. We were really big.

[00:27:59.660] - Speaker 1
Southern California biggest.

[00:28:01.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And they told me, like, I remember the first time we went to Australia. Australia was very similar to the states as far as, like, they loved punk rock music. That scene was. Green Day was popular. Blink was just barely getting popular.

[00:28:16.780] - Speaker 1
Was green day already green day or were they getting popular?

[00:28:20.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, because I think what, I graduated high school in 93, I think by 94, 95, like, Dukey was outright, and it was massive, and we were nowhere near that big.

[00:28:31.850] - Speaker 1
You feel like before they broke out, they were part of the same scene.

[00:28:34.990] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I just think they were a little earlier than us, probably like five to ten years.

[00:28:40.160] - Speaker 1
Were they a little older?

[00:28:41.410] - Speaker 2
I think so, yeah. But they definitely kicked the door down for so many bands. Like, you saw them, Rancid, everyone who discovered Green Day and Rancid went back and discovered Operation Ivy. You started doing the homework in all those bands, and then you saw the offspring. You saw all this stuff kick off like epitaph bands, Fat records bands. And then if you were a fan, then you're like, going back. You're discovering the descendants, you're discovering black flag, whatever. It led me to so many things. Gorilla biscuits, everything.

[00:29:13.800] - Speaker 1
The band had already formed before the success of Green Day. Let's say it wasn't green day that inspired the band to be.

[00:29:22.120] - Speaker 2
No, I think it was just natural. It just happened because there's always been.

[00:29:28.380] - Speaker 1
A punk rock underground.

[00:29:29.750] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I always tell people it doesn't go away.

[00:29:32.780] - Speaker 1
It's just not what's on the radio. Yeah.

[00:29:35.410] - Speaker 2
And it doesn't change it for me. I can always turn on a dagnasty or a minor threat or gorilla biscuits album. And that is my childhood. That makes me feel so like, it's like church for me. Going to a gorilla biscuit show and seeing Siv remind everyone we're all the same. We're all human beings. It's like a reset. The most beautiful reset.

[00:29:59.380] - Speaker 1
You joined the band, you're playing shows. Tell me the whole history from your joining.

[00:30:04.640] - Speaker 2
Yeah, so there was an album called Dude Ranch that was out and I was touring that. I didn't play drums on it. There was Cheshire Cat, like the album before that. And it was like put out by O from Fluff. Like, he recorded it and I think it was on Cruise Records, I'm not sure. And then they got signed to a major. They put out which label they get signed. Dude Ranch, MCA. And they had a single off that. And then I joined and I did all of the touring for Dude Ranch. Then we got in and we recorded, like, our first big album, which was called Enema the State.

[00:30:39.040] - Speaker 1
I remember. I remember when it came big deal.

[00:30:41.810] - Speaker 2
And that was recorded in a rehearsal room, just us jamming all the songs. And it was kind of the introduction to blink, doing a couple of different styles of songs within the genre. There was, like all the small things, which was like a different tempo than we had ever messed know, like, what's my age again? There was all these different rhythms. And it was the first time we had all written together. And it was so exciting. And I recorded all the drums to that album in like six or 7 hours. Everyone knew their parts, so it was just a matter of coming in. Jerry Finn took like two or three.

[00:31:23.620] - Speaker 1
Days, recorded everything separately or together?

[00:31:25.730] - Speaker 2
Everything separate drums first. Because I think I was going on a vandals tour. They had asked, hey, will you fill in and do this? It was called Turd Town tour, where we play, like, sea markets, like mexican restaurants and bowling alleys. I was like, of course I'm in. So we had already known all the songs. All the songs were written, went in, got drum sounds for, like, three days, figured out what snares we were going to use. Chick Korea studio in Los Angeles. And then from there, I went in, recorded all the songs just to, like, a click track.

[00:31:59.020] - Speaker 1
When did you first start playing with a click track?

[00:32:02.540] - Speaker 2
Actually, you know what? Enema, the state is not to a click. I'm wrong. Take off your pants and jacket. The next album is the first one with the click enema. The state is all just live in the studio.

[00:32:12.860] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but when did you first play to a click? In life, because it's a very different skill.

[00:32:18.220] - Speaker 2
It is. And I remember I used to hear about it, and I was kind of terrified.

[00:32:22.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:32:22.570] - Speaker 2
Just because I didn't know what it was going to be like. But I didn't play with it in marching band. I didn't play with it growing up, like, in bands when you're starting bands, I think the only time I played with it was when I worked with, like, a drum instructor when I was young, when I was learning how to read music.

[00:32:39.530] - Speaker 1
Like Metronome. Yeah.

[00:32:40.870] - Speaker 2
And they would really focus. I remember them always saying, your timing has to be perfect. You are the backbone of the band. Before you learn how to do anything else on the drums, you need to keep time. And luckily, when I was in the band and I told you I was practicing, I usually had a practice pad and I had a metronome.

[00:33:00.620] - Speaker 1
Cool.

[00:33:01.070] - Speaker 2
So when it came time we did take off your pants and jacket, I was really, really comfortable. And to figure out, like, hey, sometimes choruses, we push a little bit. Let's track the BPM just a beat faster or two bpms faster. So stuff like that. Then a couple of years later, it turned into us playing with a click live. And I love it.

[00:33:23.320] - Speaker 1
And to this day, that's how you do.

[00:33:25.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I've done both, and I love both. But for blink, it really works. Well, I've just done, like, the Foo Fighters tribute for Taylor, and there's no click. And it was beautiful, too, because you're just jamming. And I also did a tour with, like, anti mask after we recorded our album, and everything would just be like, we just look at each other and right when they see my right hand go to hit a crash, you know, that's the beginning of the song. So stuff like that's fun, too. But I think the way we do it with blink and we do have Moog or effects that are just on the album from backing tracks. I think it just works really well because we really love being a three piece.

[00:34:07.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Something does happen when it's really in time that's different than when it's free time.

[00:34:14.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure.

[00:34:15.240] - Speaker 1
It's not even better or worse. Just a different thing. Yeah.

[00:34:18.360] - Speaker 2
And we used to play, if you listen to Mark Trauma's Travis show, the tempos are 20 bpms faster than the albums. It was cool and it was fun, but it sounds a lot like the album now. And we're still very. By the end of the tour, I'm doing different stuff. I'm making parts that are four, four. I'm making it half time, doing whatever makes it exciting. And Mark's like, oh, I love that. Whatever we do to keep it fresh, because I don't want to be one of those bands that you go see, and there's no reason to really buy a ticket and see them live because.

[00:34:48.900] - Speaker 1
You could just listen to the record.

[00:34:50.210] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I love human errors. I love human accidents that are beautiful. I love all that stuff.

[00:34:58.360] - Speaker 1
So where were we in the story?

[00:35:00.210] - Speaker 2
So I just recorded Inama the state, like, with them, and did that tour.

[00:35:05.330] - Speaker 1
What was it like when things blew up?

[00:35:09.720] - Speaker 2
I always say I just keep my head down and keep going because I don't really want to look up. That's kind of how I was. That's kind of how I still am.

[00:35:18.860] - Speaker 1
But it went from a thousand people to playing to how many?

[00:35:21.310] - Speaker 2
To playing, like, amphitheaters and taking our favorite bands, like bat religion out to open for us.

[00:35:27.290] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[00:35:28.090] - Speaker 2
So cool. And, yeah, we didn't know that was coming.

[00:35:32.530] - Speaker 1
We've talked about a lot of music, and you've experienced a lot of music. What would you say was your music?

[00:35:38.080] - Speaker 2
There was so much like, the Beastie boys changed my life. They taught me how to dress. They liked the bad brains like I did. They liked Elvis Costello like I did. I had so much in common with them. They raised me. I loved tribe called Quest. I loved the far side. But I also was listening to, like, I know every descendant song.

[00:35:58.610] - Speaker 1
I grew up very closely related. Punk rock and hip hop. It's like, for sure. Same attitude.

[00:36:05.200] - Speaker 2
Yeah, same spirit. And skateboarding. Growing up and watching skate videos, the music was never just one style. Public enemy would be in it, and then it would be followed by a random four one one punk band song. And I would learn so much about music through skateboarding. And blink had that in common, too. Like, when I got in the band, they were, like, found out. They also loved the Beastie boys, they were just like me, but the descendants were our Bible. And then we would all have our favorite bands within the genres that we listened to, but putting them on to rap music was exciting and them loving that and finding out, like, whoa, I didn't know I'd like. Like, that was cool. And, yeah, all of it inspired me.

[00:36:58.050] - Speaker 1
How do you describe the different personalities of the band members?

[00:37:02.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah, interesting. Tom is probably, like I just said in an interview the other day, I was like, when he wasn't in the band again yet, I was driving. He's like, where are you going? And I'm like, I'm going to Utah. Like, I'm going to do this nice charity or whatever with post, and we're going to play nirvana songs. And he's like, what's post? I'm like, post Malone. He's like, who's that? This was like three years ago. I was like, so he's really not tapped into anything. Anything. It's kind of beautiful.

[00:37:34.360] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[00:37:34.810] - Speaker 2
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:37:35.980] - Speaker 1
He's him.

[00:37:36.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And he just kind of hides out and he still is pure. It's like what you and I spoke about, like, punk rock's always been here. It just might not be at the forefront or on the radio, but it's still bubling and people are still making that music and people aren't abandoning know. And he's like one of those people I love from the moment I met him. He still likes the same bands and still, that's what matters to him the most. Once in a while, like, the other day, he's like, trav, I just discovered Fred again, and I was like, oh, awesome. I just discovered seven shake. Whatever. I'm like, cool. I love that. Mark is just like the kindest human ever. They're both really kind and really easy to get along with and great friends and brothers to me, think sometimes you can be in a band with people, but you miss that. And I definitely have that with them. Yeah. Both I could call on at the drop of a dime and they'd do whatever. Be there for me as a friend, and I think we all like, I love the cure. Mark, that's his favorite band in the whole world.

[00:38:39.690] - Speaker 2
I have so much in common with them both in different areas.

[00:38:48.000] - Speaker 1
You've been a band for a long time and there aren't that many albums. Tell me when you were together, when you weren't together, why you weren't together when you weren't.

[00:38:56.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, we did a few albums without Tom, but we haven't made an album with Tom besides this one since an album called neighborhoods.

[00:39:07.080] - Speaker 1
How many did you make from the first album you did with them until neighborhoods?

[00:39:12.180] - Speaker 2
So, enema, take up your pants and jacket. Untitled, neighborhoods four. And then an ep called dogs eating dogs. So, like, five. And then, yeah, after that, I just, like, the band kind of broke up out of nowhere. We had just finished tour in Japan. Well, actually, we broke up before neighborhoods and dogs eating dogs. But there was a big gap right there.

[00:39:38.510] - Speaker 1
What was the breakup?

[00:39:39.750] - Speaker 2
It was just sort of. Well, Tom and I had done a band called box car racer in the midst of blink being massive. I think it was right after untitled or before untitled. And it was like, I was playing him a bunch of music. I was playing him, like, quicksand and a bunch of post punk stuff. It's like, this is cool, this is heavy, but still kind of punk rock. And then he's like, I have a bunch of riffs like this. After you showed me this, we should jam one day. I said, okay. And then we're jamming, and we're like, I don't know if we can use these for blink, right? He's like, yeah, we might have to do something else. We'll just put out an album. I'm not going to tour. It's just going to whatever. Then we start making this album, then next thing you know, like, jerry Finn is set up, he's producing it. It's becoming, like, a big deal. It's coming out on MCA. It's basically being treated like a blink album, but Mark's not in it. And we just were convinced we couldn't use these songs for Blink, even though we've done stuff like this, not yet in blink, but it could have easily.

[00:40:42.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So we end up doing it, and then, of course, we put out the album. It does really well. I think Mark's bummed, as he should be. Like, when I look back on it, I'm like, it's like, if me, you and someone were in a band, and then we're like, oh, me and Rick are going to go do a band. We're not going to put you in. Know, of course someone's going to feel some type of way. And then, of course, everyone's like, tour. So we end up setting up a tour. And there was supposed to be no tours. And I think that really just made the band feel really weird. So after that, Blink did a tour. We got on from that tour. Things were really weird. We were supposed to record. Then out of nowhere, we get, like, a email from a manager being like, tom indefinitely is out of the band. Things are too weird for him, whatever. And I was like, okay, were you shocked or no. Yeah, I was. Because you could feel like maybe the energy's off or something in any kind of situation. But no one had heard anyone, no one had done anything, and no one.

[00:41:52.480] - Speaker 1
Talked about it, whatever was going on. Yeah.

[00:41:54.860] - Speaker 2
Instead of being like, I don't know if Mark was like, hey, I feel really weird about this, and we could apologize or whatever. I know at the time, we were set up to do a bunch more touring and recording, and I think Tom was having issues. Like, his family really wanted him home, and then he's probably, ah, it's also weird energy in the band. So we just get this email that was like, tom's indefinitely taking a break, whatever he's done.

[00:42:20.360] - Speaker 1
Did it feel weird to come in an email instead of him calling you?

[00:42:23.810] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it was cold. It just wasn't handled, know, especially when you feel like you have a brotherhood with someone, it's like, pick up the phone because it could be like, hey, I don't feel like doing this right now, but let's just take a year off.

[00:42:35.000] - Speaker 1
Also tells us about the nature of the relationship, that the relationship was more about having fun, making music than it was about. I'm unhappy for sure.

[00:42:44.970] - Speaker 2
And I think at the time we're touring so much. I know for me, I'm like, hate flying. Hate flying forever since. Yeah. My mom. Remember my mom took me on a flight to Chicago where she was from when I was a kid and she bald hysterically the whole time. And I don't even know, but at a young age, I think. I don't even know why, but not rational.

[00:43:05.680] - Speaker 1
It's just something in our subconscious.

[00:43:07.870] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Especially your parents, who you adore and you just like absolutely everything they do. They're your heroes. So I'm like, my mom's really. She hates this. So I hated it. And I think, not to steer off too much, but to explain it. Even when I was like, 19, playing in a band called Feeble, when I was a trash man, I remember getting really drunk for the first time, and I was like, hysterically crying, kind of like my mom did, and telling my manager at the time, I'm going to die in a plane crash.

[00:43:38.660] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:43:39.540] - Speaker 2
I have this vision. So at the time when blink right before all this too, I'm flying every day. I have developed and I have kids. I have a newborn son and daughter who I'm leaving, and they're like a month old. So I developed a really bad Obia addiction.

[00:43:58.250] - Speaker 1
You think if it weren't for the fear of flying, that wouldn't have happened?

[00:44:02.420] - Speaker 2
Yes. I think it was two things. I think it was like, in order for me to leave my house, my assistant at the time, little Chris, would have to give me three Norcos and roll me, like, two blunts just to say bye to my kids. And then I would.

[00:44:15.600] - Speaker 1
Because you didn't want to leave because you want to be with your family.

[00:44:17.760] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And then Chris would be like, dude, you got to get in the car, trav. We're going to miss the flight. And then I would go, and guess what? To stay in the car, I had to take a few more pills, smoke a couple more blunts, have a drink, and then I could get on the flight.

[00:44:33.520] - Speaker 1
So it wasn't partying. It was escape.

[00:44:35.980] - Speaker 2
It was escape. Yeah. So around that time, that was probably at an all time high to where we're all like, for me, I was self medicating so much, and then, yeah, when it happened, I was kind of like, I was high. I was with skinhead, raw from the transplants. I was eating sushi at Matejisa, smoking a backwood in the parking lot, getting ready to go eat, and they sent the email, and I was like, okay. I don't know. I was so numb.

[00:45:02.770] - Speaker 1
Numb didn't. Yeah.

[00:45:04.240] - Speaker 2
And it was the worst thing that I never wanted to happen. But I remember when that happened. I was like, started slowly once in a while, talking to DJ, and we would chop it up, and I was dating someone. He was dating someone. I'd see him out, and I'd see.

[00:45:21.670] - Speaker 1
How'D you meet him?

[00:45:23.120] - Speaker 2
Just like I met him when he was in crazy town and I was in blink in Germany.

[00:45:27.480] - Speaker 1
No, he was in crazy town.

[00:45:28.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah, he was the DJ for crazytown.

[00:45:30.170] - Speaker 1
I had no idea.

[00:45:30.930] - Speaker 2
We met there one time. We were like, oh, what's know? Said hi. But when I got home, I'd went out, like, the week blink broke up, and I saw one of his sets, and I'm like, this is like, he's a great. So he was so know.

[00:45:47.610] - Speaker 1
Absolutely great taste.

[00:45:49.660] - Speaker 2
And then someone linked us, my boy nick at the time, and I'm like, we should do something. He's like, yeah, we should do something. So we got into a rehearsal room, and we jammed for, like, 8 hours straight.

[00:46:00.580] - Speaker 1
Tell me what that was like. He's a dj, and you're a drummer.

[00:46:03.360] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It was the most beautiful, magical thing ever. It's like if you were jamming with a guitar player, but he knew every genre and it was like we jammed for hours, like 8 hours. And he would play like Beatles records and it would just be acapellas and I had 808 and I would just play beats underneath it that weren't what Ringo was playing in the beatles. And then he would play me like rap records that were acapellas and I could flip them. It was almost like live remixing. But then we'd play just rock music. We'd play the who, we would play like Baltimore bounce records. We would play everything. So I'm like, I'm playing every genre I've ever loved in these sets that I'm doing with him that are an hour. And it was just incredible. And we were cut from the same clock from kind of being playboys at the time and being out all the time, messing with girls to like, the only thing was different is he was sober. And that was always a positive influence on me. That was the best thing I could ever ask for. So I really started focusing on that.

[00:47:09.550] - Speaker 2
We started playing.

[00:47:10.250] - Speaker 1
How long had he been sober?

[00:47:11.980] - Speaker 2
I think he already had like eight to ten years under his belt. He was wise beyond his years, especially where I was at. And he was like into music. He wasn't just like a dj that's just playing rap records. He's like, oh yeah, check this out. And he would.

[00:47:29.240] - Speaker 1
That's why he was so good.

[00:47:30.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And he was playing records people wouldn't dare know he was playing. Like, since you've been gone, Kelly Clarkson remixes that just. They were undeniable. You just were like blown away. So we ended up doing a bunch of stuff together. We ended up playing like headlining the Sahara tent and Echo cella. Like the year before our accident.

[00:47:54.970] - Speaker 1
Had there ever been a drummer dj combination before? It seemed such a foreign idea.

[00:48:01.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it kind of was like we didn't know what we were doing. We were just like, this is cool and different. And we had all these cool opportunities I could have never dreamed of having unless I was in blink. Like playing the vmas, doing all this cool stuff. It kept my chops up. We'd play like 2 hours straight sometimes. No breaks. There's no talking in between songs. And I could read his mind and he could read mine.

[00:48:25.720] - Speaker 1
Would you always know the music he played? Or would he ever play something you never heard before?

[00:48:29.890] - Speaker 2
Nah, there would be times when we were making our set, I didn't know what he was playing. Especially when he got into justice and daft punk. Some of it. It was like their new record and it was just so different. But when we incorporated that into our sound, it opened up a whole other universe of stuff that we could mess with. It was really cool. So cool. So, yeah, that's what I did. And I was really content and it was so satisfying.

[00:49:03.000] - Speaker 1
When does blink come back?

[00:49:05.240] - Speaker 2
Well, like I say, it takes like a catastrophe and someone almost dying for it to come. So what happened? Yeah, then my plane crash happens, and I hadn't spoken to Tom in know, not even like at this point. It's not.

[00:49:22.530] - Speaker 1
Since the email you haven't spoken to him?

[00:49:24.700] - Speaker 2
No. And then it was like I was in a burn center for like six months. And I remember people being like, oh, Tom's trying to get a hold of you. I was like, oh, cool. For the first three months, I didn't know what was going on in there because I was on so many drugs and I was so medicated. Like six months in the burn center. Yeah. Had like 30 surgeries.

[00:49:49.470] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:49:50.420] - Speaker 2
So then when I got out, he was like, hey, can I come visit you? Can I come see you? And I said, of course. And then that's when we got back together. And we did think neighborhoods.

[00:50:02.840] - Speaker 1
That was the first breakup. And then neighborhoods happened. And then you did an ep.

[00:50:08.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:50:08.590] - Speaker 1
And then what happened?

[00:50:10.060] - Speaker 2
And then it was kind of the same thing. We were supposed to record, and then I think we got a message, kind of the same thing. It was like, tom isn't going to be showing up to record. And this time mark. And I was like, fuck you. You're not going to do this anymore. And we had torn with alkaline Trio.

[00:50:32.000] - Speaker 1
Was there any weird vibes on that tour?

[00:50:34.460] - Speaker 2
No, that's the thing. And I think it was just like, not such a bad thing this time, but it was the fact it was on the books. And then we just get the message a, he's not going to show up. We're supposed to be there tomorrow. I think it's just not the way to handle things. I think everyone was just a little offended by the way it went down. And we had a show, like in a week.

[00:50:56.940] - Speaker 1
If he would have reached out and told you, I can't go, and here's why. This is what's happening with me. It's different.

[00:51:03.150] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I can kind of relate. I've never done something quite like that, but there's been times where I'm going through something personally and I might not hit someone back or I might not like, I don't know. I just know I'm not operating like myself. And I think my close friends know, like, something's going on. I think something was going on, but once again, it was like, we just wish we got a phone call or anything. And I think it had been the second time it happened. And we were just like, you know what? We're just going to do it without him. We don't have to deal with this anymore. And then Matt Skiba is great, and he's like a stud, and he's talented. So he came in, played these shows, and then these shows went so well, we decided to record an album. The album was great. And then, yeah, we did that for a few years. I think it was just a show, too. Like, you can't do this, you know? And it just worked.

[00:52:02.400] - Speaker 1
Did that band break up or how did tom come back?

[00:52:05.680] - Speaker 2
No. So we're doing that.

[00:52:08.320] - Speaker 1
How many years?

[00:52:09.630] - Speaker 2
Probably for a good, like, three or four years.

[00:52:11.810] - Speaker 1
And how many albums?

[00:52:12.970] - Speaker 2
Two.

[00:52:13.350] - Speaker 1
Two in that period.

[00:52:15.220] - Speaker 2
And we're doing it. And around that time, I think quarantine like Covid happens. And I'm kind of home more at this time. And I'm producing a bunch of stuff and writing a bunch of stuff. And I was just, like, being able to take a step back and get a long view and wide view of everything. And I was like, man, mark. And I'm talking to tom every once in a while, and I'm like, I really feel like the future of Blink is me, you, and tom, whenever it happens, and it's the only way it happens. Once it comes back to that, even if it means, like, everyone's schedule aligns and we do an album tour for a year and then take two years off whatever it is, we just make a pack that this is blank. We're never going to have any other version of it because I really believe it's the best version of know. Matt skiba killed it. Like, he did such a great job. I understand so good. But I was, like, being able to take a step back and see it like this. I think that we owe it to ourselves to say and hold that standard, that that's what it is.

[00:53:30.540] - Speaker 2
And he was like, I don't know. I don't know. Then he got sick. And blink's not really active at the time. He's chilling at home. I'm working on stuff at my studio. And then he hits me one day, and he's like, yo, I have stage four. Oh, of course. The worst news I could ever get from him. So I start visiting him, start reaching out once again. It takes a catastrophe for everyone to get back. And then Tom comes back. I start seeing him at Mark's, the same damn there. And then he's like, man, I'd really love to play music with you guys again. At this time, he's, like, completely out of know. And I was. Yeah, I mean, like, first things first, mark's got to be healthy, and then Mark's healthy, and we just start getting in and start recording and writing songs and. Yeah, the rush, just history.

[00:54:29.610] - Speaker 1
Have you ever had a conversation with Tom saying, going forward, if there's ever time you don't want to do this, would you please call me and tell me what's up?

[00:54:38.820] - Speaker 2
Feel like with blink being successful, because we did have, like, not that it matters, it's whatever, but having a successful album and being on successful tours without him, I think was some type of wake up call. Even though he wasn't really immersed in music at the time, when we were doing it, he had kind of taken a step back. I think that was a wake up call. And I think now with the album we just made and everything, I think it is precious to him, and it means more to him than it has in a long time. But that's a great idea to have.

[00:55:12.990] - Speaker 1
That conversation hurt, right?

[00:55:14.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I feel like it's easier to. I mean, the problem was, though, it was never hard to talk to one another.

[00:55:20.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Talk about it when it's good. Yeah.

[00:55:24.030] - Speaker 2
Even back then, you would have never known by the conversation we had. Oh, there's something wrong. It's more like, you just get this email, and it's like, we could have talked through this. But I love, too, that it was like no one kicked anyone's dog or slept with anyone's girlfriend. It wasn't something like that. It was just like, these unsaid things or maybe just hard to talk.

[00:55:50.550] - Speaker 1
Using the example of the band, you and Tom did not sounding like Blink originally going forward, do you feel any obligation for Blink to sound any particular way now?

[00:56:01.550] - Speaker 2
I feel like every album, and I always encourage artists I work with to do this. We've always. And do it organically in the most sincere way, is, like, those songs that you want to write, that you're afraid to write but makes the ceiling a little higher, the box a little bigger. Do like. Always do like. I think with blink, songs like Adam's song in the past, where it was a ballad and it was, like, heart wrenching that we had never written before, just widens what the band can be.

[00:56:39.220] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:56:39.640] - Speaker 2
Like, never putting a limit on what you can or can't do. This one, like the ballad one more time, one of the big singles on the album, it's for what some people think. Some people think pride blink, like, oh, it's fast. It's punk rock. It's funny. We also have the most emotional, heart wrenching ballads, whatever. So I think doing that, and then there's, like, a song called terrified on this album that was an unused box car song that's on the Blink album. So not having necessarily a genre type of song that can't go onto the album is the most freeing, greatest feeling in the world.

[00:57:23.090] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it opens the doors, future wise, of, as long as you want to make music, you can do it with blink if you want to, because it can be anything. Yeah.

[00:57:33.850] - Speaker 2
There's no rules. I love that.

[00:57:37.210] - Speaker 1
Tell me about when you stopped all drugs. You stopped cold turkey everything at once.

[00:57:43.690] - Speaker 2
So I had an interesting detox and kind of my version of rehab, because I would have never gone.

[00:57:51.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:57:52.340] - Speaker 2
I was so addicted to everything I was doing. I remember people used to come to my studio. I would always do a lot of rap sessions while I was in blink, doing whatever. And I remember sometimes I was so used to everyone rolling up, and we would smoke the whole time. And I remember one time someone came and they're like, oh, no, I don't smoke no more. I was like, what, you want some pills, whatever. And I was just like, it was so second nature.

[00:58:19.600] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:58:20.040] - Speaker 2
And I was so shocked, like, when someone told me for the first time, I'm not taking any pills or smoking, and I'm like, what happens with you? Two weeks ago, we were smoking a gang of weed and doing whatever. And the thing is, I couldn't stop. So when someone said that, I was a little scared, too. I was like, wait, what do you mean? Like, quitter, whatever. I don't know what I was thinking in my head, and I couldn't find it, the possibility for me to quit. So I was going down the wrong path, and I didn't think I had a problem, but I think subconsciously, I knew I had a problem, but I didn't know how to fix it, and I didn't want to fix it because I was just so comfortable like any other addict. So my detox, my with going through withdrawals, me going to rehab was the burn center. It was being in a burn center.

[00:59:16.620] - Speaker 1
Being in a hospital for six months. Yeah.

[00:59:19.050] - Speaker 2
And I had a really hard time. I self medicated so much that when they put me down for surgeries, I was waking up mid surgery, I was, like, swinging on doctors.

[00:59:31.850] - Speaker 1
Because your toleration was. Yeah.

[00:59:34.080] - Speaker 2
And they're like, we cannot figure out your pain. What's going on? And then they started figuring out, like, he has a drug problem, and he's self medicated so much, we can't keep him asleep. So my intention wasn't to hurt these people that were trying to help me during a surgery. I was just waking up so scared, like, what's going on?

[00:59:55.720] - Speaker 1
After the accident, were you aware of what happened?

[00:59:59.000] - Speaker 2
Well, I was awake during the whole accident. I was able to pull dj am out of the plane. I wasn't able to get, like, little Chris or Che or the pilots. That's how my hands caught fire. And then when I got into the burn center, I was so highly medicated. I was in there a month, and I was asking someone that came to visit me, like, where's little Chris? Where's Che? Are they in the next room over? I didn't know until they started weaning me off, like, less medication. I found out when I was in the hospital, but no one was telling me either, because I was a mess. My pain meds weren't working. I was waking up during surgeries. They're talking about amputating my foot. There was, like, blood transfusion after blood transfusion. I was away from my kids. It was the darkest days. So after six months of it, I was obviously not doing any drugs. I was not on any drug. I didn't want a single drug in my body for as many surgeries as I had. And then when I got out, I remember I was somewhere, and I overheard someone being like, trav is so different, man.

[01:01:11.310] - Speaker 2
You notice from all the meds he's on. And I overheard them talking about me. It was like my brother. Like a brother to me. So I went to the doctor, and I said, hey, how long do I have to be on these meds? Indefinitely. You'll probably be on it for the rest of your life. The trauma you went through and everything. Don't beat yourself up. I was like, okay, were they painkillers? Painkillers, like, bipolar meds? They were just, like, what you experienced. Take all these know. But I really didn't feel like. And. And then it was confirmation. I heard, like, someone who's, like a brother to me, being, like, I'm worried about, like, he's so different. This isn't Trav. And then they also told me, you're never going to be able to run again. You might not be able to play drums again. So after that doctor's visit, something triggered me, and I got home. I threw away all my prescriptions.

[01:02:05.730] - Speaker 1
The ones the doctors gave you?

[01:02:07.230] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I threw all of those away. I practiced that day. I put my practice pad outside. I just played the drums for a little bit, started going on walks.

[01:02:17.590] - Speaker 1
Was it painful or were you able to do it?

[01:02:20.070] - Speaker 2
The only thing that was the hang up with drumming was my hands were burnt, so they were still healing. But I had nerve damage that I hadn't taken care of yet. So half of my hand was numb, but it didn't stop me. The more they said, you're not going to be able to do this. You can't do this. You're going to have to do this.

[01:02:37.830] - Speaker 1
When you were holding the drums and playing, it didn't feel the same. Yeah.

[01:02:41.530] - Speaker 2
From my middle finger to my pinky, I was numb.

[01:02:45.090] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:02:45.710] - Speaker 2
And I was so afraid, I just.

[01:02:47.310] - Speaker 1
Wanted to come back.

[01:02:48.280] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I got it back. I was so afraid. I was in the hospital. I told them the last day I was there, I was like, hey, is this going to go away? They're like, oh, you're going to need to go to a neurologist or whatever, someone that deals with nerve dam damage. But I was afraid to say anything because I didn't want to be in there another however many months. So I ended up handling it. They did like an ulnar nerve release, and I got most of the feeling back in my hand, which was awesome. But long story short, I started walking immediately, just around my neighborhood, started playing drums. About a month later, I was back to running 3 miles a day.

[01:03:21.860] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:03:22.730] - Speaker 2
Still wasn't on meds.

[01:03:25.530] - Speaker 1
Congratulations.

[01:03:27.130] - Speaker 2
I had to bounce back, and I had my kids at my house with me, and that was like, the best motivation, the most inspiration.

[01:03:36.050] - Speaker 1
Now can you play like you could play before? Yeah.

[01:03:39.580] - Speaker 2
Everything's back. Yeah. The only thing I open up a little bit easier. I think the skin on my hands is a little thinner, so I'll have a lot of bloody shows.

[01:03:47.820] - Speaker 1
Do you ever wear gloves?

[01:03:48.950] - Speaker 2
No.

[01:03:49.420] - Speaker 1
Have you ever tried?

[01:03:50.790] - Speaker 2
I just hate the way it looks.

[01:03:52.120] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[01:03:53.810] - Speaker 2
And for me, I do a lot of intricate, fast things along with just things that are hard and just driving, and I can't have anything between me and the sticks.

[01:04:05.340] - Speaker 1
Understood.

[01:04:05.720] - Speaker 2
But most of the time when I open up, it'll be like doing something wild and I'll hit a symbol with my knuckle.

[01:04:11.250] - Speaker 1
What about, like, taping up like a boxer?

[01:04:14.060] - Speaker 2
I do. I tape these two together because about. It's probably been about six months ago now. On a fluke accident. I'm playing in a rehearsal room right before coachella, and I break this finger.

[01:04:28.770] - Speaker 1
How?

[01:04:29.630] - Speaker 2
I hit it on the snare drum. Usually I hit it and I'll do what I described, and I'll just bleed a little. I looked down, and my knuckle was the size of a golf ball, and it was stuck straight out. So I had to have a surgery on that, and it's forever like this. These are both drumming injuries, but it works fine.

[01:04:53.210] - Speaker 1
Who were the drummers coming up that were, like, inspirational animal?

[01:04:58.870] - Speaker 2
Buddy Rich, Steve Gad, Tommy Lee. Stuart Copeland was my mom's mom's favorite band. Also was, like, the police. So I listened to a lot of Stuart Copeland and didn't even know. But I'm like, the hi hat work and everything. It was just so good. And then, like, the meters, I listened to a lot, like James Brown. Like, all those drummers were great. And then even drum like. I learned how to play, like, paul's boutique from front to back. Like, every drum break, every film, anybody.

[01:05:35.510] - Speaker 1
From punk rock or metal world, I guess you mentioned one.

[01:05:38.850] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Bill Stevenson from the descendants. Mickey D from Motorhead. Loved those. Were probably, like, my favorite drummers also. Mickey D. And King diamond was great.

[01:05:50.520] - Speaker 1
I have a funny relationship with King diamond. It just makes me laugh. I cannot take it seriously.

[01:05:55.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It was something that was shown to me when I was in drumline in high school. And for whatever reason, our drumline had this obsession with King diamond. We used to go. We had this drum room. We would turn off the lights, put on King diamond, and just, like, mosh in this drum room and beat the shit out of each other. But it was the musicality in King diamond that I loved. And then it was, like, almost King Diamond's vocals just grew on me to where I learned to love it, too. And the image and everything. I was him for Halloween when I was a kid.

[01:06:30.600] - Speaker 1
That's funny.

[01:06:31.240] - Speaker 2
Everything. My mom used to tear his posters off my wall, but something about his drumming on them, I can't erase it from my hard drive. It just had, like, a big effect on me. He would use flams in really interesting ways. Other drummers wouldn't. And then when he got in motorhead, I was. It was. I don't know, just did something for me.

[01:06:53.360] - Speaker 1
My friend Darren from system of a down loves King diamond, and I would always just be laughing at him.

[01:06:59.980] - Speaker 2
Hilarious.

[01:07:00.660] - Speaker 1
It's just so ridiculous to me. How's flying for you now?

[01:07:08.960] - Speaker 2
Well, I didn't fly for 15 years. I couldn't even think about it. I went on an aviation trip with my daughter one time for school. And just from my daughter carrying my trauma with her, she walked in this plane we were supposed to walk in together, and she ran out, like, hysterically crying, which made me cry because I'm seeing my daughter be affected by my trauma. And then I just said, I'm never flying. I'm never going to fly in my life. I used to take the Queen Mary to London. That's how I'd get to Europe for tours, ten day boat ride. And then in my relationship that I'm in right now, my wife had always said, there's so many places I want to go with you. And I said, well, if you ever decide to try to take me, don't give me a heads up. Just tell me the night before like, you need me at a certain time, because I will talk myself out of it. So she told me one night, and she had been doing all these things that she knows works for me, like, I'd been doing breath work, and that was really.

[01:08:14.900] - Speaker 2
I think I held on to a lot of trauma from my accident, and someone told me, like, breath work is amazing. It's so helpful. So I really started doing that. And I would have sessions where I would be bawling uncontrollably, even though I'd go into them being like, I'm not.

[01:08:29.830] - Speaker 1
Going to trigger by the breath work. Yeah, great.

[01:08:32.140] - Speaker 2
Like, feeling high as a kite. Like, outer body experiences.

[01:08:37.020] - Speaker 1
It's psychedelic.

[01:08:38.180] - Speaker 2
It is being like, it's rad. I got in contact with people that had passed away. It was like, I don't even know. I have a million great things to say about it. But we did it the night before. She had asked, too, because she knew it was really helpful to me. And then she said, we're going somewhere tomorrow. So I immediately tried to get rid of her. I was like, you could just stay at your house tonight. Because I had this whole plan of, like, there's no way it's happening. I end up doing it. I end up getting on the flight. The flight's great. All of these things I anticipated of how I would feel didn't happen. The plane didn't crash. Everything was fine. Did a few flights. My third flight was like a private flight, and we started losing cabin pressure. It was frightening for me. I just begged the pilot, please land the plane. Please don't do any hero shit. No cowboy shit. Just lie in the plane. I've been here before. Luckily, cabin pressure is fixed about 40 minutes later, and everything was fine. It was really traumatizing for me when it happened, but I didn't let it stop me.

[01:09:46.020] - Speaker 2
I got back on the horse great. I think, to me, I love doing anything that I'm afraid of. But in this Travis, I can't have anything that holds me back or binds me or controls me. So I still fly. I think it takes a little bit of me away every time I have to fly. Like, takeoffs are really hard for me. I do some breathing techniques and I get through it and I understand I don't have control of everything. And PMA, like, positive mental attitude and, yeah, I think I've flown about 50 times.

[01:10:21.660] - Speaker 1
Would you say it gets better and better or stays about the same?

[01:10:25.920] - Speaker 2
I've sort of figured out what works for me. What works for me is putting on noise canceling headphones. I have also this guy, Howard, that I've done, like, energy work with, and he has a prayer. Howard, you know Howard.

[01:10:38.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:10:39.110] - Speaker 2
Howard is so special to me, and his prayer helps me a lot. And I listen to those prayers before I take off, and I just have my routine, and it helps me through it.

[01:10:52.810] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:10:53.450] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:10:54.420] - Speaker 1
Tell me about taking the Queen Mary across the canal.

[01:10:57.560] - Speaker 2
It's so different than any other life experience. Anyone will know unless you do it. But I used to take a bus from LA to New York, then get on the Queen Mary. It's a ten day boat ride. I would just run every day. Bring a drum kit.

[01:11:15.170] - Speaker 1
Where do you run? On a treadmill?

[01:11:16.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah, treadmills on there.

[01:11:18.140] - Speaker 1
Can you run around the deck, too?

[01:11:19.330] - Speaker 2
You can, as long as the weather is good. There's a couple of times when the weather's been bad. Like, I've been on the Queen Mary two and been in 25, 30 foot waves. That's more frightening than flying because it lasts for days at a time.

[01:11:34.050] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:11:34.580] - Speaker 2
Whereas I started to figure out if it's turbulence, usually it's what? It's like.

[01:11:38.950] - Speaker 1
Minutes.

[01:11:39.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah, minutes. And this. I can't escape when it's happening. But flying wasn't even an option, so I would just tough it out. But I had some also. Sometimes I was, like, a little afraid on the boat, but I would bring a studio out there. I would write, I'd make beats. I'd practice so much and run so much that by the time I got to tour, I'm like, I'm ready. I'm conditioned. It's not like, was it relaxing? It was. It made me relax. I'm kind of an always on the go kind of person. Very productive and I like getting into something. Even if I don't have something, I create something to do. So it was good. It disciplined me.

[01:12:23.090] - Speaker 1
Would you say most of your creativity goes into music, or are there other things you're interested in doing?

[01:12:28.580] - Speaker 2
Everything's music. I mean, I do have a couple clothing brands and stuff like that that I love, but usually it's either producing or writing for blink, or it's producing and writing for somebody else.

[01:12:40.360] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the effect of the different drugs you took at different times, just how they made you feel.

[01:12:47.430] - Speaker 2
Pills, for me, I know some people, it makes them go to sleep or, like, mellows them out to me. They would make me wired, numb and really talkative. I guess it's kind of like what having a drink to some people does for me. That's what pills did. I remember the first time I took one, I was thinking to myself, why haven't I been doing this all along? Why didn't anyone tell me I should be doing this? Because this is how I should be feeling. And I probably took a pill every day or a few pills every day, depending on the day, for about six to seven years. So that's what it would do for me. It would kind of take.

[01:13:32.940] - Speaker 1
What were the kind of pills?

[01:13:34.130] - Speaker 2
Were they like norcos? I loved what that is. It's like an opiate, like a version of a Vicodin. Vicodin volumes. I never really liked Xanax unless it just had, like, a flight. I would take it. Oxycontin, those are what I loved. And I loved smoking weed. But I think I got towards the end, I liked backwood more than smoking weed, which is basically tobacco, and getting that buzz with the tobacco buzz with the weed. Buz nothing could ever compare to that. Smoking a joint, hitting a bong, because I found that I was also chasing the tobacco high. But they're really hard in your throat. Ended up giving me, like, precancer, the esophagus, because I was smoking 15 to 20 blunts a day. I think that's what I was chasing because I used to smoke cigarettes for years, so the backwood brought back that. And then drinking was never really a thing for me. Drinking was something that I was just told myself, like, have it before you get on the flight, because it'll take everything away. Like, maybe the edge off a little bit more. But opiates and weed was more my addiction. For a short time after my accident, the only thing that I did, but it never really became anything I was addicted to was drinking, like lean, like cough syrup.

[01:14:56.340] - Speaker 2
It was the only thing that could put me to sleep. After I got out of the hospital, I had flashbacks and couldn't sleep for about two and a half, three weeks.

[01:15:04.360] - Speaker 1
And now with running and breathing, do you feel like you could feel as good? Well, I guess you didn't really feel good. You just felt numb.

[01:15:13.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I was convinced. I remember going back into the studio for the first time, going, hanging out with friends, having a meal. I had to relearn how to do everything. Everything was entirely different. And I was just thinking, like, right now, because I can have a drink now and I can have whatever out, I can micro dose with a friend or whatever, like my wife once every six months. It's nothing. I don't feel anything. But for the last nine months, I haven't had anything. And you tell yourself all of these things while you're using or while you're taking opiates or drugs, that it helps your creativity, it helps all of these things that you think you're dependent on. You're dependent on these drugs to be able to be creative or whatever it is. And I had maybe the most creative nine months of my life, whether it's like coming up with cool concepts for music videos or producing records or doing whatever, nothing assisted by drugs or drinking or opiates. And I feel better than I ever have.

[01:16:22.400] - Speaker 1
Congratulations.

[01:16:23.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:16:23.850] - Speaker 1
So cool, right?

[01:16:24.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's the most amazing feeling.

[01:16:26.780] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[01:16:28.080] - Speaker 2
So lucky that you get to, and that's beautiful. You've never touched anything.

[01:16:33.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it just worked out that way.

[01:16:34.950] - Speaker 2
I love that.

[01:16:35.860] - Speaker 1
Tell me more about am as a person.

[01:16:38.900] - Speaker 2
Am was the smartest, funniest, coolest. Have you ever seen his documentary? His documentary is great. I think it's called as I am, but it shows. He was like this overweight kid who Djed and everyone would just scratch their head because they're like, how is he pulling these girls? But he was. It didn't matter. He was so just cool and so obsessed with djing and his personality and his talent. It didn't matter how much he weighed. He was fire. He was more talented than anyone, and he was nicer and cooler and just such a blessing to be around a human like that. For me, during my process, there would be times where he'd be like, you're making a big decision. I want you to not do anything for three or four days, completely sober for four days. Talk to me. Come to an AA meeting with me. So I'd go to his AA meetings. I'd watch him talk, watch people, complete strangers speak and all of that stuff was so enlightening to me. And I would find when he would challenge me, like, sober up, make that decision, tell me if your decision is the same.

[01:17:58.380] - Speaker 2
And I'd be like, whoa. My decision is even more. I'm even more sure. I'm even more positive. Thank you. And everything he did with me led to me being sober, because I tried to get sober before my accident. So he was a big part of everything that ended up happening in my life.

[01:18:18.520] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[01:18:19.290] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:18:19.990] - Speaker 1
I only met him a couple of times, but I got a great vibe from him. Yeah.

[01:18:24.730] - Speaker 2
When he passed a year after my.

[01:18:28.260] - Speaker 1
Accident, I didn't know. Yeah.

[01:18:30.120] - Speaker 2
So it was like we both. He was in the hospital together. We were in the accident together. He would have gone out of the plane if I would have just pulled him out of the plane, and he didn't try to help me. He would have been untouched. Nothing would have happened to him. But when I grabbed him, then I tried grabbing my assistant, my security, lil Chris, and che, my arms caught fire. And then I was so in a hurry to get out of the plane because I associated fire, jet fuel, all this stuff. I pushed open the emergency exit, and I just jumped out just recklessly, and I jumped right into the jet where all the fuel was. So my whole body was engulfed in flames. And I was just running, and there was traffic. There was, like, a highway that I was running against traffic in, and I just heard someone say, stop, drop, and roll. And I was, like, taking off all my clothes, and I was stopped dropping and rolling, and my feet were just drenched in jet fuel. So if am wouldn't have padded out my feet, which is what led him to be a little bit on his elbow and his neck, I would have probably lost them, but, yeah.

[01:19:47.070] - Speaker 2
So he was in a burn center for about, I don't know, a week, and then I didn't see him for a couple of months. And then I had my kids, who were everything. They were my rock. When I got out, I couldn't. Like, the days where I'd wake up and cry, and then I'd see them. I'd be like, okay, pull it together. My daughter's right there. Everything's fine. My son's right here. My oldest daughter's right here. And I would see him, and we would be like, hey, you want to talk about everything that happened, like what you remember and what I remember? And we would sit down and chop it up, and he'd be like, man, I'm not doing good. We got to do this thing called retrain our brain. I'm like, yeah, I'm down. Whatever it is, I would love to do it, but I'm like, for me, I'm always going to look at my legs, I'm always going to look at my arms, my hands, and I'm going to be like, oh, yeah, I was burnt. There's nothing that's going to tell me I'm never going to be able to convince myself that I wasn't in an accident.

[01:20:42.560] - Speaker 2
He probably could, sort of, because he's not looking down at injuries every day, but he's like, man, I just don't have anything. You have these kids and you have.

[01:20:52.100] - Speaker 1
How long after the accident was this?

[01:20:53.990] - Speaker 2
This is about like six months after I did. He also got out of the hospital a week after the accident and he started playing shows again. He started flying again. I couldn't even fathom the thought of doing any of that, but he was. So we talk and I was like, yeah, I'll go try this retraining of the brain thing. And we would talk all the time and he would know I was back on tour with Blink. And he'd be like, oh, you don't care about me. And I'm like, yeah, I do. I love you. I'm going to hit you right when I get to New York. He was in New York. So we would talk through text or email and then, yeah, after twelve years being sober, like, overdosed.

[01:21:40.820] - Speaker 1
Do you know if it started after the accident? Yeah.

[01:21:44.970] - Speaker 2
What I was told is he had one therapist he had seen the whole time. We also had a therapist we would see together as, like, homies, even before the accident when he was trying to get me sober. And what I was told is he started seeing a new therapist and he started talking to her about how hard it was to fly. And she prescribed him Xanax when he had not had, like, xanax. This man didn't even take, like, advil or tylenol. So I think that led to other things.

[01:22:18.720] - Speaker 1
Such a sad story.

[01:22:20.500] - Speaker 2
Especially someone who was like, he was the reason I'm sober, the reason I got sober.

[01:22:26.860] - Speaker 1
And I think you're not alone. I feel like he was a light. He really helped people, for sure. When you're playing music, do you feel like you're driving the music or the music is driving you?

[01:22:39.450] - Speaker 2
I'm driving the music. So with blink, all I have is a click in my ear.

[01:22:43.050] - Speaker 1
You're not playing to the music, you're playing to the click. Yeah. Do you listen to the vocals?

[01:22:48.400] - Speaker 2
I can hear a little stage volume. I hear enough to know where the song is or whatever. But no, I'm driving everything. I have the click, and no matter what, I'm not stopping. It's how it's been since we had a click. And Tom used to be like, don't put me through your ear. Sometimes I'm just fucking up and I need you to just keep playing. So it's like, yeah, I'm the one. Like, no matter what, I'm not going to stop playing unless we're also, don't take ourselves too seriously. Of course, if we fuck up, we're going to stop and be like, I fucked up. Like, whatever, let's play this again. And our fans love it, and we can all celebrate it because you hear.

[01:23:32.040] - Speaker 1
Them enough to know to stop playing if they stop.

[01:23:36.120] - Speaker 2
Yeah. If he just butchers the intro of a song, he's like, stop, whatever.

[01:23:42.300] - Speaker 1
So you only stop if somebody yells stop?

[01:23:45.580] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's really funny. Yeah, that's crazy.

[01:23:50.000] - Speaker 1
Let's say in the recording studio, do you ever take into account the vocals when you're drumming?

[01:23:56.620] - Speaker 2
Like drum parts? Yeah, always.

[01:23:58.750] - Speaker 1
So how can you do it if you're not hearing them?

[01:24:01.230] - Speaker 2
Well, because my drum parts are already written, like, live.

[01:24:03.760] - Speaker 1
I see.

[01:24:04.290] - Speaker 2
No, but, no, I'm like how we had talked about earlier, I'm overly cautious about stepping on vocals or the cadence of a vocal or a part to where I have to remind myself, like, oh, no, you still do your thing, whatever. I'm really reserved and almost overly cautious about it, especially if I'm producing, because I don't want.

[01:24:30.600] - Speaker 1
How'd you learn to do that?

[01:24:32.520] - Speaker 2
I think, like, one of the first bands I was in, I remember them telling me it was like the first recording I had done and I never really recorded. And they're like, hey, only do fills going into the chorus, set up the chorus. Nice. Don't be busy during this part. And it was like, just songwriting 101. Don't do that there. I think once I really started paying attention to producing and writing, I really felt reserved as a drummer. And then with Blink or whatever I'm doing, if they tell me to be myself, then I will and I'll do it. I'll shine every once in a while. But I grew out of that years ago.

[01:25:14.650] - Speaker 1
Do you ever play on sessions for other people just as a drummer?

[01:25:17.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a lot.

[01:25:19.070] - Speaker 1
Is it fun?

[01:25:19.910] - Speaker 2
I love it. I love it. Or if I'm producing something, it's not my choice, but if I'm producing something and they're like, will you play drums. I'm like, yeah, of course. Or I'll say, why don't you play drums first? And then if you want, I'll go do a take afterwards. We'll pick the drum parts we like. You can play them or I can just play them. And, yeah, most of the time I'll end up playing them and the band's pretty cool, or whatever. The drummer is pretty cool. But that's not my first choice. My first choice is like, you play it, of course. And then I'll kind of say, like, hey, have you ever thought about doing this here? Yeah.

[01:25:55.670] - Speaker 1
What's the difference between playing on a session as a drummer and being the drummer in a band?

[01:26:01.540] - Speaker 2
So I'm probably more reserved in being my band. I try to do both. I try to be like, hey, would you like this if you were in the band? And then as a blink fan, what also would you expect? Or what would you want to hear? A lot of the times when I go in and I do something and they just want to play drum something on something and the song's written and they just want my ideas or whatever, I'll go in and most of the time they're like, okay, do one where you go crazy now. And that's what they use.

[01:26:32.580] - Speaker 1
Really?

[01:26:33.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and I'll be like, are you sure? Because I think I'm doing too much and I'm stepping on too much, but.

[01:26:40.290] - Speaker 1
It makes it more about you than about the song. Yeah.

[01:26:43.110] - Speaker 2
And I think if it's my band and I'm playing drums in it, I'm very cautious about that. But I'm not going to tell a producer that's doing it. No, I'm not going to do what you want me to do. I'll say I'm happy to do it, but I think it's a lot.

[01:26:56.760] - Speaker 1
It's funny. Most people want to play more.

[01:26:59.150] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I imagine it's like if John Fuchante goes and plays on something and then they're like, no, we want you to go crazy on it. He's going to be like, okay, I will, right? I'll do it. But it's not the first thing that comes to my mind. I feel like I am overplaying and it doesn't sound right. I like being able to do that, and I like then being told, no, we want you to do you. And then I feel comfortable, but I feel really great about still just allowing me to tell them my opinion.

[01:27:28.820] - Speaker 1
It's also cool to be able to play so well that you don't have to make it flashy, and you can still tell it's great. Just that pocket carries it. Yeah.

[01:27:40.250] - Speaker 2
Like Charlie watts.

[01:27:44.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:27:44.910] - Speaker 2
Those are great drummers, and there's a reason we like those songs. And even though the drumming isn't anything flashy, it's great. It's hard because I think the drum community just expects so much out of something, and you also have to respect simplicity and holding back, and you're known.

[01:28:11.540] - Speaker 1
For playing loud dynamically. Is it cool to play quiet?

[01:28:16.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's amazing. I love it. You know, I learned over the years, too, is like, live for me, is dynamics are so important, and even adjusting your technique and maybe conserving your energy for verses and have them be closed up and then choruses are really bigger, and then the big parts of the song really explode. But it doesn't have to all be exploding. I think dynamics are everything. I think it's like, what really separates great drummers and musicians from other musicians. But I feel like that's. I don't even think about it anymore when I go on stage. I just recently had started figuring this out because on this last us tour, it's never really happened to me. But mid set, I'd start thinking, and I'm like, whoa, this trump heart's fucking weird. And the end. And I'm like, oh, my gosh, trav, stop thinking, stop thinking, stop thinking. And I kind of figured it out. But do you know who Tim Grover is? He wrote a book called Relentless, and.

[01:29:24.940] - Speaker 1
He was, oh, yeah, someone just sent me that book.

[01:29:27.530] - Speaker 2
So good. He was Michael Jordan and kobe coach and mental coach. And I was like. I was talking to him, and I'm like, I find when that happens lately, I'm like. I say my mom's name, who died when I was, like, 13. She passed away, and I'll be like, mom, and I can snap out of it. And he's like, oh, trav, this is normal. He's like, kobe used to tap his shoulder when he was in his head, and he's on the court, and he's, like, thinking too much. Like, jordan used to pull his shorts down. So I have these resets that I do with him. And he also said something interesting. He's like, because I don't really think about what's going on up there. My body's just moving. I'm not like, here comes the purse. Here comes this. I'm doing this. I don't know what's at. My body's just in flow, like autopilot, in a way.

[01:30:13.580] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:30:14.390] - Speaker 2
And it's almost when I think I'm stopping autopilot, I just took control of the plane or the car, and he's like, trav, you're not supposed to do that. He's like, after talking to each other a lot, he's like, some people put a mask on to go on stage. They take a drink. They have to get. Get drunk. They have to psych themselves up to go on stage. He's like, you take a mask off to go on stage, your mask on is like going through life, because that's where you feel most comfortable. Let yourself feel comfortable. Keep your mask off. And I was like, oh, my gosh. I've never thought about it like that. And he's so spot on. And once he broke it down, it hasn't happened.

[01:30:58.980] - Speaker 1
Great. Yeah.

[01:30:59.860] - Speaker 2
And it's just like, yeah, it's so true.

[01:31:02.070] - Speaker 1
It's amazing how just a piece of information can reset the way we understand things.

[01:31:08.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Your book helped me a lot in those resets, too. I would listen to it a lot on the tour. There's one part in your book where you say, try practicing with the lights off or doing what you do with the lights off. And I started doing it on tour different, right?

[01:31:21.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:31:21.900] - Speaker 2
Well, it's like if I can play, because I kind of have this routine where before I even go out on stage, about an hour before I start rehearsing, I just start practicing, warming up. And then I got into the habit, like, probably a few years ago of just playing the set. I play pieces of the set, every song, a little bit of each song. And I started doing it in the dark because I'm like, if I do this in the dark when I go up there, this is the easiest thing ever. It used to just be running through. It made me feel, like, easy, and just, like, I had the utmost confidence when I go up there, because I'm like, oh, I've already played the whole set. This is round two now. Doing it with the lights off or slightly uncomfortable is even more reassuring. It's great.

[01:32:06.290] - Speaker 1
Cool, man.

[01:32:07.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah. There's lots of useful things in there. Like, I bought it for everyone. I bought it for a lot of people for gifts. It was great.

[01:32:14.790] - Speaker 1
I'm so glad you liked it.
