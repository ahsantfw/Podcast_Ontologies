[00:00:06.760] - Speaker 2 
Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. Tétragrammaton. For a lot of folks, they think it should be easy because they see from the outside, well, this caught a viral moment. And yesterday this person wasn't famous, and today they are. And they're not understanding that that doesn't mean you are actually building something sticky and important on the right road of having a career in music. And so we're meeting a lot of hobbyists. And so that's why meeting talent is the most important. That's why the pandemic was so scary because you couldn't really meet them and really look in their eyes and see, are you up for the Pepsi challenge? 
[00:01:02.030] - Speaker 1 
Did you sign any artists during the pandemic? 
[00:01:04.040] - Speaker 2 
Very few. Because it was a hard process for me because I was just like, I'm talking to people through Zoom and you can't really look them in the eyes to understand, do you really want this life? My company is architected around Touring X. I only want to sign an artist that want to tour.I see.I want to build something.Are. 
[00:01:22.900] - Speaker 1 
There artists now who don't want to tour? Absolutely.that's interesting.Oh, yeah. 
[00:01:27.390] - Speaker 2 
You have artists that are like, Well, do I really have to go out on the road? And then you're like, Well, if you just want to stay in your bedroom and make pop music, cool. That's done for us then. And then you have artists that are like, I want to wait till I can only play 5,000 seaters because I don't want I don't want to be small. 
[00:01:47.230] - Speaker 1 
It's going to be hard to be good in a 5,000-seater if you don't work your way up to that, I would imagine. 
[00:01:52.080] - Speaker 2 
Dude, they walk across the festival stage because they get booked so early to do festivals. And they think because they played at a festival to a few thousand people during their time slot, that that's not what they're worth. They don't realize they're there for the festival, not you. And so they have this weird notion that there's something wrong with Mercury Lounge. They don't understand. Mercury Lounge is great 
because it lets you figure out your banter, your show, and those around the country that size. It's a safe space until you get to the 500 either, and then the thousands either. 
[00:02:31.920] - Speaker 1 
Tell me about the artists who are successful, who go on tour and have a big audience touring versus those who have popular music that people like, but maybe don't sell any tickets. 
[00:02:43.720] - Speaker 2 
This is the interesting thing. I have a bunch of artists that I wouldn't say they have big hit records, but each song consistently streams a nice little amount. So they're building this catalog catalog this way. Each song is doing, let's say, 100,000 streams. So when you add it all up to 10 songs is a million streams a week versus having one song doing a million streams a week. I'm just doing simple math, right? That artist is starting to go out on the road and build because the audience is interested in 10 songs.Not one.Not one. 
[00:03:21.160] - Speaker 1 
If you have a choice to have an artist to have 10 songs getting a million streams or one song getting a million streams, you want the 10 songs. 
[00:03:28.600] - Speaker 2 
If you have an artist doing Each song is doing 100,000 streams, and it adds up to the million versus the one million, it's just like you could see that the catalog is performing. 
[00:03:39.680] - Speaker 1 
People are buying into the artist, not just the song. 
[00:03:42.590] - Speaker 2 
And that's the difference in how we're trying to sign talent. 
[00:03:46.600] - Speaker 1 
How important is social media these days? 
[00:03:49.330] - Speaker 2 
It's the most important thing. 
[00:03:50.610] - Speaker 1 
Is it the most important? 
[00:03:51.790] - Speaker 2 
Because that's where content is consumed, the short form content. 
[00:03:57.130] - Speaker 1 
More than streaming, Spotify? 
[00:04:00.390] - Speaker 2 
So this is the interesting thing. They're hearing the music, their full song on the Spotify, on Apple, on Amazon, but the discovery of the artist is vis a vis all the short form that is on Instagram reels, on TikTok, on YouTube Shorts, on Snapchat. And so that's where kids are finding about you, what your sound is, where you're from, your clips. And then they're coming in to hear it on the streaming platforms because that's where their library is. 
[00:04:35.730] - Speaker 1 
How important is video today? 
[00:04:39.090] - Speaker 2 
I think the video is a good artist development piece to Tell us context to give us a storyline. Let us know more about you. But if you don't figure out your strategy of short form into the long form, then it's just going to be something that no one gets to. And then you made it, and then it's like a tree falling in the forest. You have to drive people to it. So let's figure out our content strategy to get people to get to the longer piece. And also for artists that are artist, the music video can be the art piece that really is a beautiful extension of the music. Each artist is so different in terms of just some when they're making the music video, it's the full storytelling of the song, and then some, it's this beautiful piece of art that just was this great creative. 
[00:05:37.860] - Speaker 1 
This poetic imagery that goes with the music. Correct. 
[00:05:40.460] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. 
[00:05:42.150] - Speaker 1 
Are the artists more involved in the video process these I mean, I think so. 
[00:05:47.380] - Speaker 2 
I think this whole generation has grown up knowing that music, videos, and content is just how they discovered, and it's part of their world. And so, yes. And they usually by the time they get to us. A lot of the times they've had a little videographer or a friend of theirs that was really their person. And we try to encourage them to, If this is working, you don't need to hire anybody amazing. If Somebody would make great videos for a dollar in a dream. Let's just give that person more money. You don't need to leave them to go to a better person right now. Let's just keep it going. And then unless that person has really hit their limit, and then it's a great way for us to also be in the, let's find new young directors and new visual folks. 
[00:06:37.100] - Speaker 1 
Tell me a couple of artists that you're excited about now. What was going on with them when you found them? What stage they were at? And where you see the potential. 
[00:06:47.780] - Speaker 2 
It's so interesting because we just literally closed this kid from Vancouver. His name is Cameron Whitcom. And my A&R folks brought him in and said they saw some of his songs cooking a little bit. Describe what that means. So we have a full research department that is staring at many different platforms, and they're seeing music that is cooking on Spotify, music that's cooking on SoundCloud, music that's cooking on YouTube, Apple, wherever. 
[00:07:26.880] - Speaker 1 
I think Atlantic was the first company, even before you were there, it was the first company to have a research Department. 
[00:07:32.610] - Speaker 2 
That was Doug. Doug was Mr. Research. Yes. I'll never forget Doug. Dolling. Do you do research for marketing? I said, No. Dolling. A hit is going to be a hit. You don't need to spend so much money on marketing. You know what I mean? And I was like, Huh? Because we didn't test our records at Def Jam. And he was like, You could test before you spend. I was I was like, Oh, get out of here. So our research guys turn our ANR people on to everything that has a pulse. And so all of the A&R folks are hearing stuff and seeing stuff. It just needs to have one pulse. I prefer it to not have a thousand RPMs. I want it to be so early because we're an artist development company. The minute it has a lot of pulse, then everybody else is looking at it, Most of the artists that you sign are not... 
[00:08:32.190] - Speaker 1 
Other labels are not yet interested. 
[00:08:34.440] - Speaker 2 
So there's the, we find stuff super early that no one's looking at. And then we still are in the game of finding things that other people are jumping on as well. But I prefer to be as early as possible, with very few monthly listeners or very few subscribers. 
[00:08:52.520] - Speaker 1 
And even if that means it's a longer wind up period, you're fine with that. 
[00:08:56.820] - Speaker 2 
Rick, there's no shortcut, even when the song is cooking. Real artist development is still three years. If you can beat it in two years, God bless you. 
[00:09:09.600] - Speaker 1 
But typically three years is realistic. 
[00:09:13.130] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. To tour and build and do what you need to do, who's beating the three-year mark? To build something. 
[00:09:22.160] - Speaker 1 
Something's bubbling, and what happens next? 
[00:09:24.760] - Speaker 2 
The A&R folks will say, We heard it. We spoke to the artist. We're going to fly the artist in, and here's all the music and everything you should see and look at and absorb. And then artist comes in, and then the artist kicks the tires on us, and then we kick the tires on them to see if this is something that we really are going to believe in. 
[00:09:51.770] - Speaker 1 
How many people in our department, approximately? 
[00:09:55.230] - Speaker 2 
Probably from top to bottom on the pop rock On the side, I'd say there is, I think it's 17. And then on the urban side, it's probably around 15. 
[00:10:10.620] - Speaker 1 
So in 30 range total? 
[00:10:12.600] - Speaker 2 
Probably. When you include the assistance and coordinator and A&R and folks. Yeah. 
[00:10:16.880] - Speaker 1 
And for someone to either be brought in or to be signed, how many of the 30 people have to be excited about that artist? 
[00:10:26.580] - Speaker 2 
Just one. 
[00:10:27.460] - Speaker 1 
Just one? Absolutely. Yeah. So if one person really feels it, that's what it takes. 
[00:10:33.320] - Speaker 2 
One person has to feel it. Yeah. Because you know what happens is they come in, they say, I'm really excited. I throw them out of my office. And then they come back in and say, I'm really excited. I throw them out of my office. And if they don't come back that third time, then I know I dodged one. 
[00:10:49.180] - Speaker 1 
So they have to be really, really, really three times excited. 
[00:10:54.710] - Speaker 2 
Very excited. I'm not letting any ANR person hedge. Yeah. That's the worst thing ever because you know how long the road is, and you know most of it is not going to be perfect. 
[00:11:08.180] - Speaker 1 
You're making a big commitment financially and time-wise, probably bigger time-wise. 
[00:11:13.510] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. Because now you're not only involving just the ANR person, but the marketing team, publicity team, tour marketing team, the digital team, the content team, the brand partnership team. We have so many people that has to surround the act that if the ANR person is hedging and doesn't see it through hard or that the first song didn't work and doesn't have a plan to go somewhere second and third, then all these people who are there are invested are just like, What happened? Where did you go? 
[00:11:45.930] - Speaker 1 
Is the ANR person the lead person to move things through the company? 
[00:11:51.450] - Speaker 2 
It's supposed to be that way. If you have a dynamic ANR person, they're supposed to drive it. They're supposed to help shepherd the ANR process of making records. And then I always say to them, When you're done with the record, don't get out of the front seat. Just slide over to the passenger side. But you better stay in that front seat with the marketing team. Because they have a vision. You were there. You signed it. You were helping making this music. You know more than us where we should be going. And when shit gets hard, it can't just be the marketing department having tough conversations with the artist. We all be in it, and our people should never get out of that front seat. 
[00:12:29.230] - Speaker 1 
How different is the plan for each artist? 
[00:12:32.810] - Speaker 2 
Different. Different. 
[00:12:35.430] - Speaker 1 
What's it determined by? 
[00:12:37.260] - Speaker 2 
      
The taste, the tone, and the act. So Charlie XX was coming back, and this was going to be more 

electronic. So it was like, Hey, let's launch her around a boiler room. Let's do these cool raves. Let's have 

her present the music. And the fans were coming out and they're not realizing we were grabbing them in 

packs of 10 bringing them downstairs into this basement. And then they could secretly hear the album 

because they thought they were coming to this rave. And we had cameras hidden everywhere in the 

basement. And now we're filming them, losing their mind because they didn't know they were going to 
 
hear the Charlie Xex album three months in advance. But just creating these really cool, weird 

experiences that are part of the artist brand of what they're trying to communicate on this project of just All 

right, this is going to feel different than the last album because she's going more electronic. So it can't feel 

like her cool pop album. It needs to feel more like it's in the ethos of dance and electronic. So therefore, 

the presentation needs to accompany it. And we're having more fun because we're convincing artists to 

do more shit for the fans. 
 
[00:13:54.350] - Speaker 1 
What? What are the things they're doing? 
[00:13:56.230] - Speaker 2 
  
Like allowing us to play the music for them, allowing us to invite a bunch of folks and give them the 

private SoundCloud link before anybody else, before it's anywhere on Spotify, Apple. Let them hear the 

music and let them be like, What the fuck? I thought I was just going to catch a link to the... And then it 

disappears. And then it was like, If you weren't there, you weren't there. As opposed to hold everything so 

tight to the vest and be so scared of letting shit go until the day the album comes out. It's just like, Now 

we're just like, no, put your fans to work for you. One, reward them. But two, let them tell everybody what 

they think.It. 
 
[00:14:37.710] - Speaker 1 
[00:14:47.220] - Speaker 2 
 
Was amazing. Absolutely. And that only works if it's really good. Absolutely. If it's not really good, there's 
 
a question of why you're putting it out.Ding. 
 
Ding, ding.Yeah. Then it's just, Hey, let's not be afraid of the artist doing smaller things where there's an 

intimacy between you and the fans. That's the other thing. It's just like, one, it's more expensive in the 

sense that you're not touching a million folks at once, but it's a richer experience for those fans. Then they 

go out there and say, Oh, my God, I got to be in this pop-up, or I got to go to this house party, or, Oh, my 

God, the artist literally just showed up in my house and just played the music in my house for me and my 

10 friends. 
 
[00:15:23.350] - Speaker 1 
What would be an example of a very intimate thing that a very big artist of yours did? 
[00:15:30.120] - Speaker 2 
Ed Sharon, this fall, literally, we found, was it 12 or 15 extraordinary superfans of his? And he went into their house and he played the song for that family in their house. We recorded the live version in the 
person's house, and we recorded the content. And then we put up the live video, and we also put up the live song, and it would say from Rick Rubin's house. So that fan not only got to see it, but then...They're associated with it forever.They're associated with it forever. They're associated with it forever. Online. So cool. And then also the live. I mean, just it was a full giveback of just like, Hey, I'm doing this for one of one. And he's down. And we found extraordinary stories of just this fan who just beat cancer and this fan who did this. I mean, it was just beautiful stories of finding just great people. We're great to Ed, but Ed gave back to them. 
[00:16:40.530] - Speaker 1 
How would you say what you do at Atlantic is different than what the other major labels do. 
[00:16:46.270] - Speaker 2 
So I always say to everybody that it's always the people, right? And my experience is going to be much different of talking about how I love touring. And I have this building down the street from me called Madison Square Garden. And my dream is for you to get there. And all I would ask in return is an all- access pass. So I could be there watching the whole thing. 
[00:17:15.800] - Speaker 1 
How often have you had the experience of a band that you were there from the beginning getting to play at Madison Square Garden? 
[00:17:23.500] - Speaker 2 
Very often. Because I'm at Atlantic for 20 years.Unbelievable.Yeah, I just celebrated 20 years last month.Unbelievable.Yeah.Time. 
[00:17:32.260] - Speaker 1 
Flies.yeah.. 
[00:17:34.020] - Speaker 2 
But even Osamasun, one of my new young rappers, underground rapper, he played Urban Plaza, which is 800 kids. And we just started with him a year ago. 
[00:17:46.880] - Speaker 1 
Amazing. 
[00:17:47.870] - Speaker 2 
And he's already playing the 800,000 Kids in the major markets. And we're not doing nothing that feels like a heavy corporate push, but It's just making sure that he's the right resources for his art, his videos, his tour support, what he needs to make sure that the stage show, because honestly, making sure that if he's going to sell that ticket for $32, it better look like a $60 or $75 show. 
[00:18:18.740] - Speaker 1 
That the audience always leaves feeling like they got more than their money's worth. 
[00:18:22.920] - Speaker 2 
We want the kids to think they ripped him off. The fact that he's there and the kids are there and you can just feel he's building something and we're all in this together. I was just in the West Coast office yesterday, and he's in the West Coast. He's just so happy that it's all going the right way of just his way, he's building it. And it's just this fantastic partnership of not feeling like we have to go so hard on the gas, but we're allowing him to be in the driver's seat with the right resources. And it's just like the last time he was in New York, we were talking about the double Excel freshman cover. He's like, Do I really want to go for it? Do I not want to go for it? Is that too corporate? Is it not? And it was just like, he's so open to hearing the different opinions. And at the end of the day, we were like, Listen, man, this is your decision. Whatever you want, here are the good things about it. Here's the things that might feel yucky. He's like, It's so cool that no one's trying to force me into anything I don't want to do, but laying out both sides of the conversation. 
[00:19:41.190] - Speaker 2 
I think that's where we understand culture And we're about, what is it that is going to have you impact your cultural audience? I think that's where we do really, really well. It's not just about the, How do I get to the most streams? It's, how am I building something that's sticky? But doing it in a way that the artist feels good. Yeah. 
[00:20:08.710] - Speaker 1 
And then long term, the relationship with the fans is different. If you do get to that point where you have all those streams, it's not empty. It's built on something. 
[00:20:18.880] - Speaker 2 
Yeah, absolutely. Look at Lil Uzi. It's real. Yeah. Lil Uzi, Jack Harlow. I watched them play Barkley Center and watch kids losing their minds and feeling like they were a part of something because they helped build Jack Harlow into a big... And now he just launched a festival in Kentucky, his Give Back to a City called the Gazebo Festival. It's him and Siza co-headlining the festival for the two days. And he's got an 
amazing curated lineup of big acts down to small acts, which is his give back of turning on Kentucky to all these amazing, talented younger artists. It's so great because it's just like we help build something that's giving it back. 
[00:21:05.100] - Speaker 1 
You remember him coming in the first time? 
[00:21:07.010] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. 
[00:21:07.940] - Speaker 1 
Tell me about that. 
[00:21:09.010] - Speaker 2 
Came in, his curly hair and his glasses, and he did not look like a rapper that was going to be signed to Generation Now. Outside of M&M, very few white rappers do you take seriously Oh, yeah, they're really going to build it, right? Or they're going to be part of the culture. And he came in, and Generation Now was just like, We love this guy. He's been touring in Kentucky and Louisiana, and he's building something. He was a really warm person in the very first meeting, and he was Very curious. My guy who still works with me, Kaiser, from Def Jam. And Kaiser gives a whole speak about, Yo, you've been doing this for 30 years. We used to work at a little company called Def Jam. And we had this guy, DMX and Jay-Z. Sometimes these young artists look at us and go, Who? Jack was so interested in the history and who were the people we worked with beforehand and wanting to learn because he has been a student of hip hop. And so he was like, Wait, you were a part of some of my heroes careers? What? And so it was just... 
[00:22:25.510] - Speaker 2 
He was so interested and so curious. We were like, Oh, my God, this kid is so But he knew about touring. He was touring locally. And so he was not afraid of the hard work. And he was building something. And he also was about, I have my crew that I want to take care of, which I love anybody who's just like, These are the people who helped me get here. I want to make sure I'm also raising up my hometown and my home team. That's always a great sign. And then he just went to work. And he was not an overnight thing. It took time. It took mixtapes. It took real touring and slugging it out and doing good work out there. And he's a real touring act. 
[00:23:10.520] - Speaker 1 
How different are the personalities of the different new artists you meet today in terms of the different personality types? 
[00:23:19.400] - Speaker 2 
So last week, one of my A&R guys from the West Coast sends me an artist, and he says, Listen, this guy has no followers. He literally just put out very little bit of music. But I got handed this demo from a producer because he was in town. And he sent me these three songs, and the guy's tone was beautiful. And said, Did you put out any music? And He said, Yeah, there's three songs up on Spotify. No listens, maybe 4,000. I'm talking nothing. And the tone of the music of the three songs before to where he's going, I was just like, he sounded so special to me. He said, he's coming to meet with some of us on Wednesday, but it's really early. It's really early. I said, I'm getting on the plane. 
[00:24:11.540] - Speaker 1 
Wow. So you got on the plane to meet someone who has no following at all. 
[00:24:17.200] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. Because I was just like, that voice was so good that I was like, I want to meet the guy whose voice is behind this. And when he came in the room, he was Very shy. And it took him a minute. And I just stayed in the conversation to get him to see that friendly fire. It took a minute. And then I got him to smile. And then he had the most wonderful smile. But it was really interesting because from the music, I was expecting someone so much more verbose in the meeting. And to the contrary, he was a quiet guy in the meeting. But his music has so much oomph. 
[00:25:00.900] - Speaker 1 
Do you remember your life before hip hop? 
[00:25:03.240] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. 
[00:25:04.250] - Speaker 1 
What was the music you liked pre-hip hop? 
[00:25:07.030] - Speaker 2 
I had to listen to radio growing up, upstate New York, until MTV hit the air. I remember always being in a car because I lived upstate New York, so everything was in a car.Your. 
[00:25:22.570] - Speaker 1 
Brothers and sisters?Three sisters. 
[00:25:24.300] - Speaker 2 
Older, younger? Two older, one younger. My older sister loved the Rolling Stones and the doors. We had a ranch-style house, and my parents converted the garage to their bedroom. So when you walked in the front door, you'd walk in, there was a living room, then a family room, a kitchen, dining room. To the left was a long hallway, and our bedrooms were on the left. The whole other side of the house, kitchen, living room, dining room, laundry room, on the other side was my parents' bedroom. They got as far away from the four daughters as possible. And so that side, the house with the four daughters, my oldest sister, her stereo was she ruled the house. She ruled it with an iron fist, my sister. When MTV came on, I remember Madonna, Michael Jackson. And then when I was in high school, I started getting into Depeche Mode, the Smiths, and the Cure. I think there was a whole rite of passage of getting into it.Foost Punk.Yeah. When I went to college, I got into 10,000 Maniacs, and I got into Echo and the Bunnymen, and Joy Division, The Water. That was big for me at Tulane. 
[00:26:42.030] - Speaker 1 
Did you always love music? 
[00:26:44.370] - Speaker 2 
You know what? I always appreciated music. It was a part... Because I was always in a car going everywhere, and I played sports. I was always either on a soccer team or a volleyball team. And so you're always listening to music because you're always traveling in a car. So it was always either on a walkman or in the car or on a boombox. I remember for sixth grade, I remember begging my parents for a Hanek. I just wanted one gift. It was the boombox with the double cassettes so I can make my own. So it was a part of my life. But in a million years, I never knew I could be in the music business or ever thought there was such a thing as having a job in the music business because you saw the MTV Awards and the Grammys and the AMAs, and it was so far away. It was this magical special place that normal people like me were never going to be a part of and never thought about it. 
[00:27:45.090] - Speaker 1 
And then when did you first hear hip hop? 
[00:27:46.700] - Speaker 2 
The first hip hop was probably Run DMC in middle school and Beastie Boys and LL because they made it onto Top 40 radio. 
[00:27:54.960] - Speaker 1 
And then what was your first job in the music business? 
[00:27:58.330] - Speaker 2 
So after Teach for America-What's Teach for America? So that was this program that came out my junior year of college. This woman from Princeton basically got funding. She wrote this thesis on how to help solve the teacher shortage in either rural areas or the inner city. And she got funding. 
[00:28:18.750] - Speaker 1 
So was your plan to be a teacher? 
[00:28:20.290] - Speaker 2 
No. I read about this program about this woman who basically was like, Hey, I'm going to go to really good schools and try to attract people who are never going to be teachers and say, Give me your years right out of college to do some good, like the Peace Corps in the United States. And I read about it and I thought, wow, this could be really awesome. I'll give back. I'll get some really good experience. I want to go to law school. I want to go be a lobbyist. I want to end up in DC. 
[00:28:50.940] - Speaker 1 
That was your plan? 
[00:28:52.040] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. I didn't know that. Oh, my God. I was going to go in DC and go do good. I thought either I'll be a children's rights advocate or a women's rights advocate. I was definitely going to DC. I loved it. I did a program where I'd go down to DC during the summertime. And so I always knew that DC was my calling. Politics was my calling. I'm really struggling. 
[00:29:16.930] - Speaker 1 
You would have guessed it. 
[00:29:17.700] - Speaker 2 
I have to teach for America. I taught in the projects of New Orleans. It was an all-African-American school right in the middle of the projects. And I went and I taught the third grade, and it was really tough and very challenging. And after that, I went back to New York City to go study for the LSATs so I could go to law school. And my boyfriend had moved to New York, and I wanted to be near him. And so my cousin told me about this guy who was looking for an assistant, and she worked at Rush Management. And she said, There's this guy, and do you want to be an assistant? And I thought, well, how hard could that be? I could 
study for the LSATs. And I just assumed an assistant meant a 9:00 to 5:00 job. I had no idea what I was really walking into. 
[00:30:03.450] - Speaker 1 
Tell me what you were walking into. 
[00:30:05.160] - Speaker 2 
I walked into 6'5, jet black hair, Lira Cohen. And he said to me, Why should I hire you? And I said, Because I'm really smart. I've got a great work ethic, and I type 50 words a minute. 
[00:30:18.120] - Speaker 1 
How old were you at that time? 
[00:30:19.290] - Speaker 2 
I was 22. I typed up itineraries because he managed LL, Run DMC, Public enemy. He managed TRIBE, Dela. Everybody was there at that time. And I'll never forget because his office was just one room. He made me sit on the edge of a couch with this wooden shelf. I literally sat on the arm of a couch. One day, he comes up behind me. 
[00:30:41.960] - Speaker 1 
So not only not a desk, but not a chair.Not. 
[00:30:43.620] - Speaker 2 
A chair.Yes. Okay. He comes up behind me one day and he starts yelling at me, You lied. I was like, What I do, Lior, what I lie about? He's like, You don't know how to type? Because there I was with one finger, one finger, banging on the typewriter. I go, Yeah, but I'm really smart of a great work ethic. 
[00:31:04.560] - Speaker 1 
What was that job like? What were the things that you had to do? 
[00:31:08.030] - Speaker 2 
Oh, my God. I have such funny stories of my first years with Lior. Obviously, I answered his phone. I dealt with his schedule. He once made me... He gave me this big, giant jiffy envelope, and he made me walk over to Round Avenue A to go give Christopher Williams a package. I was just like, Why does this thing smell so much like weed? I mean, it was a giant jiffy of weed. And he was like, Don't look inside. I was 
like, Am I going to get arrested? He's like, No, no one's going to suspect you. I was like, I can't. I was so scared. And he was like, And he was so cheap. I couldn't even call a car. I had to walk along Houston back then between Elizabeth to Avenue A. It was all crackheads back then on Houston Street between that area. It was needles. And there I was scared shitless, walking as fast as you It's not possible carrying a giant jeffy of weed, thinking to myself, If I get arrested, my parents are going to kill me. And it was so crazy, Rick, because he gave me a numerical pager because he was like, I need to be able to call you 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
[00:32:15.680] - Speaker 2 
I go home one weekend and I took the pager, and I put it on the table. And my dad said, What is that? I said, Oh, it's a pager. Because I know it's a pager. Why do you have a Pager? And I go, Because the guy I'm working for says I have to have one. He says, Dauteur, there's only two types of people that carry pagers, doctors and drug dealers. And I know I didn't pay for med school. I was like, Dad, I swear to you. I swear to you. It's this guy. I'm working in this Music business. Music, this rap management company. I mean, I was such a smart student. I had great grades. I did teach in America. I was going to go to law school. And here I am all of a sudden working for a management company. And little did you know I was walking a jiffy with a giant thing of weed. 
[00:33:09.790] - Speaker 1 
What were your first thoughts when you met the artist? 
[00:33:12.470] - Speaker 2 
You know, it was... Christopher Williams was so handsome and he was so smooth. And Flavor Flav was hilarious. He was so much fun, Flavor Flav. Although Flavor Flav got me in so much trouble one time because I picked him up to take him to the airport. And back then, you could walk through the airport. And I took him to the gate, and I left him at the gate, and then I went home. And then that night, I got called. Everyone yelling at me. He didn't make it to California. He never got on the plane? He didn't get on the plane. I literally walked him to the gate, but I didn't see him get on the plane. I literally left him at the gate. Yes. Yeah. So that was a good life lesson that you actually make sure the next time that you walked him on on the plane and made sure you stood there and you watched the plane leave after that. That's amazing. Yeah, he thought it was hilarious. Yeah, Flav. 
[00:34:09.500] - Speaker 1 
And then how long did you work there? 
[00:34:11.900] - Speaker 2 
I only worked at Rush Management for either by the end of the year or January. Lior asked me to move over to Def Jam. It wasn't as long of a run with him because he was like, there was a hole upstairs in the 
promotion department, and he He was super excited about Onyx. And he was like, I need to focus on Onyx. And he was like, take this job upstairs, learn another side of my business, go into the promotion Department. And God bless him. He definitely was like, This girl's smart. She's good. Let me push her out. 
[00:34:55.540] - Speaker 1 
Did you just think that you could do anything? Is that why he was putting you in these different situations? 
[00:35:00.100] - Speaker 2 
Ultimately, as we got to know each other and grow more and more, I guess, because he moved me from promotions and to the GM of the promotion Department. He had me start his marketing department. He gave me art video. As we got to know each other more and more as the years went on, he kept handing me more and more. But even when I was his assistant, I was so young. First of all, I was there at the crack of dawn in the morning, and I would stay till God knows.Dependable. Yes. And whatever it was, I mean, literally, I remember I needed to get Public enemy their visas to go to Australia. And I went down to Washington, DC, to go get into it with the embassy because of flavorfully with his record. And I figured out how to do it. I went down there, I sweet talked. I actually went down there with some Def Jam bombers and gave some people some bombers at the time to help me get visas, move forward. Those Def Jam coats, they were gold back in the day. Yeah. 
[00:36:01.750] - Speaker 1 
I think the fact that we never had them for sale and they were only for people who either worked at Def Jam or who were down with Def Jam made it very desirable. 
[00:36:10.360] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. But whatever challenge Lior ever gave me to figure out with getting an artist somewhere or whatever it needed to be, I used to figure it out. 
[00:36:23.630] - Speaker 1 
Describe Def Jam at that point in time when you were there. What was it like? 
[00:36:27.710] - Speaker 2 
I mean, it was very chaotic. When I first started, the Promotion Department was super disorganized. 
[00:36:36.390] - Speaker 1 
And this was the label was being distributed by Columbia? 
[00:36:39.100] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. 
[00:36:40.750] - Speaker 1 
And how much of the work did Columbia do versus how much of the work did Def Jam do at that time? 
[00:36:44.820] - Speaker 2 
Columbia was the marketing end, they had the product managers. Def Jam was the promotion and A&R side. And so it was very disjointed. I was working in the promotion department, and Rhonda would pitch an artist to take him to BT down in DC DC. And so it wasn't like anybody from Sony would talk to us about it and be like, Oh, you're taking this artist to DC. What else could we be doing? And stuff like that. And so I saw an opportunity to be like, All right, you're taking the artist to DC, call the regional, and be like, Hey, man, what else could we be doing? And that's when I learned about Howard University being down in DC and being like, You know what? What if I got you a hotel room? And then, Can we do this and this? And can we set up radio I'll do interviews with these stations? And everybody saw that I was so, I'll do this, I'll do this, I'll take this off your plate. I was able to work my way around the promotion department to be like, All right, let's figure out how to do this and this. 
[00:37:46.200] - Speaker 2 
Because I wasn't asking them to do extra work, but I was like, Don't worry, I got it. And then I would write up-What do you think the draft came from? It was just an exciting new thing for me. I don't know. It was just like, Being able to afterwards, I'd go downstairs to the second floor. Lior, I was on the third floor now, and Lior was on the second floor. And I'd be like, Lior, what about this, this, and this? And he would get so gassed about the whole like, Yeah, and let's do this. And there was new music coming in. And I knew that Defjane was cold as can be, and we needed to become hot. And so I have no idea. I was 22. 
[00:38:25.900] - Speaker 1 
Was it fun? 
[00:38:28.040] - Speaker 2 
It was so much fun. It was a lot of work.That's. 
[00:38:30.300] - Speaker 1 
Probably part of it, too. 
[00:38:31.710] - Speaker 2 
Yes. He had said something about rap music wasn't mainstream then. He made it so much of a mission of driving it and making it become bigger. When he talked about the music and the artists, I bought into the fact that we had a mission on our back and that we were doing something not just for the sake of just selling records, but that there was this bigger purpose out there, which made me feel so like, here I thought my life was going to be about helping individuals in politics and being a lobbyist. He appealed to my sense of like, oh, my God, I'm going to be an advocate for artists, and I'm going to help work in hip hop and make this big and awesome and drive something bigger than me. 
[00:39:29.820] - Speaker 1 
Where did you experience resistance about hip hop from the mainstream? 
[00:39:34.740] - Speaker 2 
Well, because our songs and videos weren't necessarily the cleanest at Def Jam, you weren't getting on MTV during regular hours, if on MTV at all. You had to be clean to get on your MTV raps. In Bet, the rules were even tougher. And so the only place we were really seeing our music videos was the box. I literally used to go home from work. I'd go to Lior's house. He had two phone lines, and I'd sit at his house from eight o'clock at night to midnight with two phone lines, requesting our own videos in certain markets where I know we were getting... I had the list from the box of every localized region in the country and where I was seeing the spins from the DJs, from the mix show DJs. Like, Babito was our mix show DJ guy. And so he let us know where we were first catching heat. And then I would bang the video in the marketplace. And literally, I used to sit there and call the phone numbers from the box. And then it occurred to me at some point, remember to get interns to do this. That's when I started the intern program because I used to sit there and literally at his house all night long and call. 
[00:40:56.990] - Speaker 1 
So the interns was like a phone bank? 
[00:40:59.280] - Speaker 2 
Yes. 
[00:40:59.820] - Speaker 1 
That's amazing. 
[00:41:00.590] - Speaker 2 
Yes, because initially it was me, like a knucklehead sitting at his house with two phone lines. 
[00:41:05.110] - Speaker 1 
You cracked the code, then you realized you didn't have to do it yourself. 
[00:41:07.720] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Necessity is a motherfucker. 
[00:41:11.640] - Speaker 1 
Did you have any people that you could talk to either at other record companies? Or do you have any mentors? 
[00:41:17.480] - Speaker 2 
It was all... I mean, it was Lior. Lior was so there 24/7, and he was always available, and he was so interested in making the company better. Because All of a sudden now, he was focused on it, where before he was doing rush management, and now he was like, I'm going full tilt in. He wanted to know, what is it you need? What can we do? How do we make this better? I used to just sit in his office and throw ideas at his head. He would throw ideas at my head, and then I'd go upstairs and then start trying to execute on the plan. It was him. And we grew really close, and he gave me so much confidence to I believe I could do anything upstairs. We were a cast of characters working upstairs. Rhonda ran video, and she was a fighter, and she was a tough woman, and she just was like, I'm going to fight to get my artist on BT and Soul Train and the things that were important to us. We had Babito, who was handling all the DJs. Then we had, I'll never forget, going to see Def Comedy Jam and thinking, this It was the funiest experience. 
[00:42:32.200] - Speaker 2 
And then I had the idea, Hey, man, what if I was able to get a ton of tickets? Because I saw that they would hand out free tickets. And Kaiser would give people tickets in New York to fill the audience. And so then when they came back around to do another taping, I was like, Wait a second. Can I have the tickets? Can I have a bunch of tickets? And then I started using them for radio. And doing fly aways and then flying in winners when they heard our call. And then I got the idea, Wait a second. The programmers would probably love to see this, too. So let me not only do contests, and then I started flying in radio programmers, and then I keep them for the weekend and then take them to see Def Comedy Jam. And then the next day, have a hotel suite where we played them all our upcoming music, presented them with the new artists, take them out for dinner, and then send them home on a plane. I started realizing the power of what we had with the Def Jam brand and Russell. I'd go to Lior and I'd be like, It's going to cost us $50,000, but every PD is going to fly in, and then we get to present. 
[00:43:45.840] - Speaker 2 
And because I was able to go right to the top, he would be like, This is great. Let's do it. 
[00:43:51.070] - Speaker 1 
And there were no other labels doing anything like this? 
[00:43:53.610] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely not. No. No. We were in the culture, man. We were in the streets. And we also had this incredible brand that meant something. We always knew our vinyl, people were opening up our vinyl. That's why we printed Def Jam on the outside envelope. The white sleeve had the Def Jam logo on it because that Def Jam logo was so powerful. It meant something. 
[00:44:20.170] - Speaker 1 
Tell me a typical day in the office back then. 
[00:44:22.500] - Speaker 2 
Oh, my God. I'd get there 8:00 in the morning. There was this one old computer that was probably from the early '80s that I would pull BDS to understand where our records were playing. Then I'd go sit with Wes Johnson, who ran our promotion department, God bless him. We'd just talk about where our records are at and what do we need. You'd have to leave the building at some point to go over to Broadway to talk to the A&R folks to try to understand when records are coming, where's our music, what's the timing and stuff like that. To come back. It was so disjointed because our conversations with the people at Columbia were so not every day, not in it with us. I'll never forget the day we were allowed to start making up the sampler tapes. And then once we were able to start convincing artists to let us put their music out early on the sampler tapes, then we started hiring the localized teams to start putting our tapes in, barber shops, sneaker shops, lifestyle shops, handing them out at concerts and stuff like that. And that was a whole another wave of marketing, of just taking our music and being like, Our best promotion is our music. 
[00:45:44.230] - Speaker 2 
I mean, That's why we needed Lior because he was so good at convincing the artist who looked at us like we were crazy to say, You're going to give away my music? And we were like, Yeah. We're just going to give away a few songs. And that's what got the street teams going, was we needed someone to distribute the cassette tapes for us in all these different markets and handing them out. And then we'd hand out posters and flyers. I mean, these days we're always like, How do we get to the kids? 
[00:46:15.090] - Speaker 1 
Anything you could do to go direct, you would do? 
[00:46:17.440] - Speaker 2 
Yes. How do I get to the DJ? How do I get to the kids? How do I get to the kids on college campuses? We didn't have enough money to just go far and wide. You had to really be about, Where is the audience? And how do we make sure it's going specifically to that audience? 
[00:46:34.850] - Speaker 1 
How would you know when it was working? What's an example of feedback you would get where like, this worked? 
[00:46:40.850] - Speaker 2 
I remember you could feel the energy on Onyx. Even though, throw your guns in the air wasn't programmed on MTV and BT, it started to have its natural pickup on the box, and it started getting requested. And then, those cassettes sampler tapes were moving fast, and people were like, oh, my God. The feedback from our different DJs were like, yo, this shit is so hot. This shit is so hot. And you just had your group of people that would give you the feedback of, yo, shit's cooking, shit's working. Like, Funkmaster Flex. God bless him. You know what I mean? Dj enough. They were the hot DJs that would be like, yo, this shit is so dope. This shit is fire. And then they'd be like, I'm going to book them to play, come through Sunday night on the tunnel. It's just like you could feel the energy in New York City. And then it was like, All right, we got to go knock down Philly. Then we got to go knock down DC and Virginia. 
[00:47:44.390] - Speaker 1 
It would always start with places you could drive to first? 
[00:47:47.190] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. 
[00:47:48.630] - Speaker 1 
So you'd build the East Coast first? 
[00:47:50.920] - Speaker 2 
Northeast, before we moved down. Yeah. 
[00:47:53.530] - Speaker 1 
Then would it typically be south or would you go West Coast? 
[00:47:56.950] - Speaker 2 
Once the Northeast was really locked and loaded, it was an easier easier drive to go down to Florida. I see. We had Virginia, we had Wowee, we had the right stations that were just always our support stations going down the East Coast that you could do the drive to Florida. 
[00:48:14.520] - Speaker 1 
Hit every spot along the way. 
[00:48:15.720] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. It was an easier drive. You never ask anyone to drive all the way to California. One of the reasons why Kaiser and Kevin became so close is Kaiser didn't know how to drive, and Kevin would come. He would rent the 15 passenger van, and Kevin would do the drives for Kaiser to take our artists around, not only the tri-state area, but the mid-Atlantic region. Because we weren't necessarily hiring cars and vans and stuff like that. Def Jam, again, Lior used to manage us with the money. So we used to have to rent a 15-passenger van ourselves and drive people around. 
[00:48:54.510] - Speaker 1 
It's great. 
[00:48:55.510] - Speaker 2 
It was really interesting how much, like, Onyx This gave us so much energy because not only did we... Because after throw your guns in the air, Slam was such a big record for us. And Slam really gave us this ability to be big and to get on some mainstream looks at that point. And I remember. And then even there was a remix with Biohazard. It all of a sudden gave this electricity upstairs in Def Jam. Okay, we're not just so ice cold anymore. And you know, momentum breeds momentum. It just takes one. And then after them, then all of a sudden, there was Red Man. And then it just started. 
[00:49:44.310] - Speaker 1 
And what was after that? 
[00:49:45.470] - Speaker 2 
Well, what happened is we left Columbia, and right when we were leaving Columbia, Baby Chris, God rest his soul, signed Warn G. 
[00:50:00.340] - Speaker 1 
Tell me what you remember about leaving Columbia. Was that Columbia's choice or Def Jam's choice? 
[00:50:07.410] - Speaker 2 
Lior wanted to...Wanted. 
[00:50:10.270] - Speaker 1 
To leave? 
[00:50:10.440] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. 
[00:50:11.260] - Speaker 1 
Was that when the company was sold or was that just a distribution deal with? 
[00:50:14.710] - Speaker 2 
Polygram.he paid out Sony. He paid out. Sony, he bought back his half. Him and Russell bought back their half and then sold to... 
[00:50:23.130] - Speaker 1 
At the same time? Yeah. The marketing department came in when you went to Polygram? Yes. Any difference between the way it worked with distribution of the relationship or similar? 
[00:50:33.380] - Speaker 2 
All of a sudden, we were partnered up with Island. 
[00:50:37.600] - Speaker 1 
That happened right away? 
[00:50:39.020] - Speaker 2 
At Polygram? Yeah. At first, it was great. 
[00:50:43.560] - Speaker 1 
Was Island new to Polygram or no? 
[00:50:45.480] - Speaker 2 
No, Island had been there before us, and it was great because now all of a sudden, there was these partners on the other side that were like, Hey, we want to help you cross Warren G. So all of a sudden now, when Regulate came out, it was a big song for us on MTV, and we only had urban radio promotion. We did not have pop promotion. And they leaned into us and were like, We could take this to Top 40 radio. And they made it a big hit for us at Top 40 Radio. That's great. And we sold a lot of Warren G albums. And that was our first album in with Polygram was Warren G. And so our first thing was super successful. Then From there, we caught Montell Jordan. This is how you do it. And they leaned into us, and they did the top 40 for us. And so it was great at the beginning. It was great having a partner. But then at some point, they decided that they were going to start signing Urban Music at Island. And now we were competing. And Lierre was like, I don't understand this. 
[00:51:57.540] - Speaker 2 
I'm giving you all this stuff. What are you trying to compete with me? And so eventually, he spoke to somebody at Polygram, and we moved over to Mercury. But even then, he just needed to be in control of everything. But we went on a great run. The '90s were fantastic for Def Jam. After Red Man, Kate Method Man, eventually, obviously, Jay-Z, DMX, Ja, Ludacris, Kanye. I mean, it was a great run. 
[00:52:29.550] - Speaker 1 
How far in advance did the idea of selling the other 50% of the company? When advanced the idea of selling the other 50 % of the company, when was that on the radar? 
[00:52:36.830] - Speaker 2 
That happened in 1998. Going into '99 was when Lior and Russell decided it's time to sell and merge. And then Universal acquired Polygram. And then Doug offered Lior the ability to now merge Island and Mercury together with Def and acquire the other 50 % of Def Jam. 
[00:53:03.770] - Speaker 1 
That all happened together. 
[00:53:06.480] - Speaker 2 
Yeah, I was bummed. I was just like, Why? Why are we selling? I was just like, we were hot as can be. Lior and Russell wanted to sell. 
[00:53:16.410] - Speaker 1 
Yeah, and how different was it after selling? 
[00:53:20.090] - Speaker 2 
Very different because now all of a sudden, we merged, and now we were part of this thing called Island Def Jam. 
[00:53:26.500] - Speaker 1 
Were you guys running Island Def Jam from the beginning? 
[00:53:29.110] - Speaker 2 
Jim Caparo was the chairman, and it was Jim, there was John Reid, there was Lior. There were a bunch of people. There were a lot of chiefs in the beginning of the merger. Yes. But Lior said to me, I want you to go upstairs and you should run the marketing department for the pop rock side. And I'll never forget because I was just like, Wait, what? I'm the queen of hip hop. What do you mean? You want me to go do pop rock? And he was No, this is going to be really bigger. 
[00:54:01.110] - Speaker 1 
Up until this time, you had only worked on hip hop music. 
[00:54:02.700] - Speaker 2 
Only hip hop music. Yeah. 
[00:54:05.120] - Speaker 1 
And how many years in is this? 
[00:54:07.380] - Speaker 2 
Six going on seven. But unbelievable years. Like, crazy good years of hip hop. Yeah. You know, The fun years, the scary years, Jack the Rapper, the BREs, the impacts. It was full. In the mid '90s, hip hop's exploding. We're selling five million albums on Jay We're selling five million albums on DMX. I mean, we're cooking. Yes. Like, really cooking. And I mean, and Badboy was coming up. And all of a sudden, obviously, Death Row. Hip hop was on fire. We were banging against the Insynx and the Britney Spears. We were there. We're big. We're getting on MTV. We're playing the MTV Awards. We're winning a Grammy. It was now like, instead of Urban Radio playing two rap records in all R&B, they're now playing 
a lot of rap music. I mean, there was a whole station called Hot 97. A switch got turned on, and now it's only playing hip hop music. A whole station committed to hip hop music. 
[00:55:16.400] - Speaker 1 
How radical was that when that happened? 
[00:55:18.160] - Speaker 2 
Oh, my God. We were there when the switch got turned on, and we committed right away to all this advertising because we were like, Oh, my God, we're here. We have a whole station that is going to play us. It was exciting. I mean, it was the most exciting time because we finally we made it. 
[00:55:34.370] - Speaker 1 
That was when hip hop really broke through. 
[00:55:37.250] - Speaker 2 
Broke through. It was still dangerous, and it was sexy, and it was exciting. Def Jam just felt so good. And that logo was everything. My job was the keeper of that logo. I was supposed to... If artwork wasn't great, you didn't put it out. You were not going to do anything to diminish that logo. And when I had to call Leon and say, We shot this video and it's not great, but I think it's going to hurt the logo. All I had to say, It's going to hurt the logo, we'd eat the budget. He knew exactly what I meant. 
[00:56:13.190] - Speaker 1 
What was How do you like moving over to the pop side? 
[00:56:17.700] - Speaker 2 
At that point, you're just like, who are all these artists? There were so many artists signed. That was the other thing. There were 14 acts at Def Jam. And everybody was gold platinum or multi platinum. All of a All of a sudden, we take over these two companies that we have to merge, and there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of artists signed to these two labels. We did the hard part, which was going through listening to all the music, meeting artists, in doing what we thought which was right, which is letting them go and not just being a part of something if no one cared. And we brought that roster all the way down to just make sure that we could focus on the acts. And that's when I was just like, you cannot sign an act unless you really want to keep them because dropping an act is the worst conversation you could have. The merger taught me that. I was 28, 29, and I was like, wow, this is the The first thing you could do is tell an artist, unfortunately, we have to part ways. And we hadn't even been in the fight with them, but we just knew there's no way we could get into the fight with them. 
[00:57:25.620] - Speaker 1 
Okay, so now that phase of learning the pop side, what was that like? 
[00:57:30.150] - Speaker 2 
It was really interesting because I started to date this guy with three earrings. He wore these three metal hoop earrings, and he was this rock dude, and he worked at MTV. Our first date was to see Rage Against the Machine. And then he took me to see the prodigy play Irving Plaza, and he took me to see Radiohead, and he took me to see-And this was all out of your wheelhouse at that time? This is all out of my wheelhouse. I just started dating this guy, and I'm only a Def Jam, and this is in '96. And it was funny when we merged, I felt like, wow, how crazy is it that I've been going to these shows only as his girlfriend, and now all of a sudden, I'm going to work on these artists. 
[00:58:18.680] - Speaker 1 
It's like the universe set the stage. 
[00:58:22.000] - Speaker 2 
The universe set the stage. I would come home at night, and I would ask him about all these bands and talk to him and pick his brain. And it was incredible having him at home as my boyfriend, as I would come back from these meetings and these conversations and be like, Louis, we just signed this act. What do you think? And he was so helpful. He was so informative because he knew so much about, obviously, pop and rock music. And so I had a secret weapon of just trying to really understand what clubs and what places we needed to market to Because I was taking the same approach of, we can't spend a billion dollars, so we have to be at the right scene and the right skate parks versus the place with the dudes with the black T-shirts and understanding where everybody was living so we could be more efficient and more effective at marketing. 
[00:59:18.190] - Speaker 1 
Do you remember any of the early breakthroughs in that world? 
[00:59:22.570] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. Saliva, Josie Scott. And he was a big, over-the-top personality, and he was fantastic. And then one of the first bands that we had crazy success with, we had American Hi-Fi. We had a hit with them at Alternative Radio. And then I went to California for a trip. And when I was in LA, I got a phone phone call. I called Louis to talk about something, and he says to me, Hey, man, Lior just offered me a job to come to Ireland to do A&R, and I was going to kill Lior. I was like, Are you crazy? I don't want to work with my guy. Lior was like, I need him. I need a person I can trust. I like his... And Louis did Some 41. 
[01:00:05.160] - Speaker 1 
But he asked him before telling you or asking you. 
[01:00:08.390] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. Yeah, like a knuckle. Typical Lior. He knew I would be saying no, so he went around me. But Some 41, which was massive for us. Massive for us. Big band for us. And super fun and exciting and youth culture. And again, once you catch a few, it just all started. 
[01:00:30.920] - Speaker 1 
And then when did you go from pop marketing to... Was the next step running everything? 
[01:00:37.850] - Speaker 2 
Yeah, I was still at Def Jam, and I was doing all the urban stuff. I was doing the pop rock stuff. And then Lior moved up more at the company and really took the company. And then he said, You should become president of Island. 
[01:00:52.080] - Speaker 1 
Did he move to a more corporate type job? 
[01:00:54.240] - Speaker 2 
No, he became chairman of Island Def Jam. I see. And then he made me president of Island. I He still was running all of the urban marketing for Def Jam, but he said, You should run this. Kevin's the President of Def Jam. You still run marketing for Def Jam, but you'll be President of Island. Yeah. He just kept pushing me up. 
[01:01:14.730] - Speaker 1 
Yeah.how long did you do that version of it? How was that different? Did your job change or not really? 
[01:01:20.790] - Speaker 2 
Actually, it didn't change at all. He just gave me the title. With Lior, I never had a contract. It was always a handshake, and it was always like, I never really I thought about titles. At Def Jam, we didn't really have titles. We didn't care about that stuff, or at least I didn't. As long as Lior knew what I was doing, that's all that mattered to me.Your. 
[01:01:43.980] - Speaker 1 
Job was safe. 
[01:01:44.930] - Speaker 2 
Yes. Yeah. I didn't care about the outside world. You know what's funny? Lierre always wanted me to do press because he thought it was a good story. And he was like, You should do press. You should tell your story. I was like, No, I like being very behind the scenes. I always liked being, if you knew, you knew. And if you didn't know, you didn't know. But he always was like, No, tell your story. And especially when I became President of Island, he made me do a lot of press. He was like, You're a woman. You're running the company. Women have to see that they could become you. And so he definitely kept pushing me out there. He's always been my advocate to be like... But he also saw I earned it. I mean, I worked my ass off. Absolutely. I cared more than everyone. 
[01:02:35.390] - Speaker 1 
Yeah. How and when did you decide to leave Def Jam? 
[01:02:40.310] - Speaker 2 
Lior left Def Jam. I went Def Jam to go become the chairman of Warner Music Group. 
[01:02:45.800] - Speaker 1 
I see. 
[01:02:47.270] - Speaker 2 
And so when he left, I was going to go. But then I was told I couldn't go because people at Universal didn't want me to leave. And so it got funky in terms of a legal issue. 
[01:03:02.440] - Speaker 1 
So how long did you stay? 
[01:03:03.950] - Speaker 2 
He didn't come back the first week of January of 2004. And I was there until March. And then L. A. Reid came in to become the new boss of Island F-Jam. And then at some point, L. A. Reid said, Okay, you told me I could go. Great. And let me go across the street to go work with Lior. 
[01:03:26.380] - Speaker 1 
And then what was your first job at the new place? 
[01:03:30.370] - Speaker 2 
President. Of Atlantic. Of Atlantic. 
[01:03:34.950] - Speaker 1 
In the history of Atlantic, what was that stage of Atlantic? What was going on at Atlantic at that moment? 
[01:03:40.000] - Speaker 2 
No bueno.Not good.Not good.Not good. 
[01:03:43.130] - Speaker 2 
No. I literally came over and I had to fire hundreds of people and at Electra, too. And literally, they both had staffs of over 200 folks. And I had a lawyer told me I had to get the place to 185. And I was eight months pregnant, going to nine months and having to fire a lot of folks. It was brutal. I think the reason why my son is so crazy is because I was so stressed out for that last month of his. 
[01:04:18.470] - Speaker 1 
How did you manage pregnancy and motherhood and being president of a company that needed your full attention? 
[01:04:26.700] - Speaker 2 
Well, you know what's the interesting part is in '99 '98, '99, when we merged with Ireland and Mercury, I was pregnant with Lulu, my first child. And so when I was meeting everybody at Ireland and really like coming in to take over the marketing, I was this big fat pregnant woman. And then sure enough, five years later, when I'm now merging Electra and Atlantic, I'm coming in as a big fat pregnant woman. My joke was, if you guys, if I get pregnant again, you're all fucked because I'm obviously merging another company and firing a bunch of people. But it was brutal. It was brutal. Listen, letting go of an artist is the worst conversation. Firing people that, again, you haven't even worked with. I literally... I was playing Beat the clock from March 17th to April 26th, meeting as many people as I could, interviewing them, trying to get as much intel on who's who, and then staffing a new company. And I was definitively in the, I'm not trying to be Atlantic, I'm not trying to be Electra. I'm trying to create a new company. And I was really trying to understand who was down for the new because here's Napster and this new thing called iTunes. 
[01:05:53.450] - Speaker 2 
And the industry was freaking the fuck out that CDs were imploding. We needed to change, and we needed to become a new company. But I made my decisions, and within four weeks, I literally called my 
doctor and said, I need to move my C-section back. Give me one more week. So I had one more week to do all the firings so I could get that thing started. I wanted one more week so I could assemble everybody. Come back fresh. No, so I could quickly assemble everybody and then say goodbye. And then Lior literally called me maybe four weeks into my maternity leave and said, I need you back. He's like, This place is a mess. You got to come back. I cried. Because my first child, I had just merged, and I had no maternity leave on the first kid because he was like, I need you. And then on the kid number two, I think he gave me at least eight weeks on kid number one. On kid number two, he started calling me four weeks in like, This place is a shit show. You have to come back. And I didn't even know any better to be like, Wait, there's a law. 
[01:07:08.090] - Speaker 2 
Wait, I'm supposed to have a light. I'm supposed to... And I came back and-Did you bring the baby to the office? Not really. When I was in the office, I was so focused on really trying to figure out, okay, what is this new company going to be? 
[01:07:23.440] - Speaker 1 
Tell me about that building a new company from... Would you say it was from the ashes or was it just totally new? 
[01:07:32.200] - Speaker 2 
Well, the honest answer is because there was Craig and Jason, there were parts of it that couldn't be totally new. And I needed to work really hard to assert That we needed the new. 
[01:07:46.780] - Speaker 1 
And Craig and Jason were more on the ANR side? 
[01:07:49.400] - Speaker 2 
Yes, they were 100% the ANR side. 
[01:07:50.930] - Speaker 1 
So you were dealing with everything other than ANR, essentially. 
[01:07:54.220] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. And I knew that I I had right on my side that we needed a new culture. I even had Ahmet who was like, We need a new company. And so I was just like, Guys, we cannot be in thinking that whatever worked yesterday is going to work. We need to be in the, Man, we got to do things differently. We have to 
be smarter. We have to be more nimble of a company, and we can't just be about running radio. We need to be about marketing, and we need to be about touring. 
[01:08:35.690] - Speaker 1 
It's an interesting thing that you were coming from a culture that was about marketing and building artists from the bottom up. At that point in time, Atlantic was a company that was about radio promotion and throwing it against walls, see if it sticks, opposite vision of the business. 
[01:08:53.650] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. We used to say in our meetings at Def Jam, we would bang against Everybody. And I'll never forget, we'd say, Hey, we're not going to outspend Columbia. We can't out-clout Atlantic. But man, we can out-taste them and out-hussel them. And that used to be our rap. Later on in the mid '90s when all of a sudden everybody was getting into signing hip hop. When the majors were like, Oh, shit, we need to be in this. And it was really funny that that was part of our rap, and now here I am, running Atlantic and like, Oh, whoa, whoa. We're not going to just go top down. We got to go build shit from the bottom up. 
[01:09:36.370] - Speaker 1 
How did bringing that esthetic to the non-hip hop act work? 
[01:09:41.280] - Speaker 2 
I'll tell you, one of the first alternative acts we signed was Death Cap for Cutie, and they loved it. They loved the whole conversation of understanding that we're about building, and we're also about culture, and we're about taste, and we're about the logo and things that were really important at Def Jam, they were about, too, about their brand, their logo, touring, touring, touring, and making sure that everything, the esthetic of their world. 
[01:10:14.790] - Speaker 1 
Also interesting that even though the styles had changed, the original meaning of the Atlantic logo and the original meaning of the Def Jam logo were fairly similar. They were both culturally significant, tasty from the street, the realest of the real, just different time periods. 
[01:10:37.910] - Speaker 2 
Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:10:40.060] - Speaker 1 
So you were really bringing Atlantic back to its roots, even though That wasn't really the mission, but it was just the nature of how you came up. And then how long did it take to make a difference at Atlantic? 
[01:10:54.520] - Speaker 2 
I came over in 2004. I'll never forget, in 2007, we were having an end of the year breakfast. Ahmed was there. And Ahmed stood up and he talked about how he couldn't believe how great the company was doing. And Rob Thomas gone solo, James Blunt. We had to work on Apollo Nattini, TI. We had Narls Barkley, I think was that year. We had just a whole bunch of beautiful, interesting types of artists from all different genres all working. And he gave a speech about how he was so proud of the company and just he was so glad to see that he saw his company turn around. 
[01:11:39.960] - Speaker 1 
How long it had been since it was hot, would you say? 
[01:11:43.520] - Speaker 2 
It definitely had been a while because that's why-10 years, eight years, a while? It's like... I was so knee deep. I always never looked at what anybody else was doing. So I can't really tell you. 
[01:11:57.990] - Speaker 1 
That's really an unusual thing in the music business. Many people in the business are really watching everyone else. 
[01:12:04.000] - Speaker 2 
I was always so focused on my own garden. I don't know what other people were doing. That's great. But because Ahmet was in the building every day, I called Jack Holtzman. And I said, Jack, I'm so focused on building a great company. I can't build two logos at once. I believe in a logo so much. Please forgive me. I'm going to retire the logo Oh, until I can get Atlantic up and running, and until I find someone who can really help me give it vision, I hope you'll be okay with me. It's just going to be temporary. I promise you, you have my word. As soon as I get this place cooking, I will bring back the Electra logo. 
[01:12:49.740] - Speaker 1 
That's because you cared about it enough to do that. 
[01:12:52.830] - Speaker 2 
Oh, absolutely. He was so cool about it. He wrote a note to the staff about it because he just It was like, The logo needs a champion, and it needs somebody. At the right time, I know it will be back. He was 
super supportive of that because he wasn't in the building. He had left, and Ahmed was still here. I don't know if it would have been the other way around. You know what I mean? It was just literally, he was showing up to work every day, Ahmed. 
[01:13:19.660] - Speaker 1 
What was Ahmed's days like in the office? 
[01:13:21.970] - Speaker 2 
Oh, my God. He'd show up every day, and he'd be in his office, and you could walk downstairs and play music. You could whip him out for an artist Just any time an artist performed, he'd come. He'd come to shows. He would come see Narls Barkley playing their first show at Webster Hall. He'd come see Paulo Nuttini. He'd come see. He really came out. And it was great because you would watch him watching an artist and be tapping his feet. And I always was just like, you know what? If I could get this guy to tap his feet and be into the music, This is the George Washington of the music business. And if he's getting super excited, like, yeah. Amazing. And he had good stories to tell. He had so many funny stories. His incredible life. Oh, my God. His life was insane. And so I was telling you that Friday, he gave the speech thanking us about Atlantic being turned around. That Saturday night was when he went to the Rolling Stones concert and accidentally fell and hit his head and died. Wow. But I tell you, we had closure. 
[01:14:32.140] - Speaker 1 
Yeah. 
[01:14:32.980] - Speaker 2 
He said, Yo, my company is back. I am so glad. And he thanked me. 
[01:14:39.270] - Speaker 1 
Maybe he was ready. I don't know. 
[01:14:42.080] - Speaker 2 
All I know is that we had this breakfast. He banked us. He saw his company return to health. And then Saturday night, he fell.Wow.Yeah.. 
[01:14:52.050] - Speaker 1 
And what a place to go out at a Rolling Stones. Oh, my God. 
[01:14:54.840] - Speaker 2 
We should all fucking die at a Rolling Stones concert, right? Perfect. But that was, yeah. So that's when I knew we were cooking. 
[01:15:03.100] - Speaker 1 
Who are the current crop at Atlantic that are really moving the needle? 
[01:15:06.580] - Speaker 2 
Oh, my God. So now, obviously, Bruno Mars is one of our big guys. Cardi B is one of Big Women, Coldplay, who I just adore. Ed Sheeran. We've got Lil Uzi Vert, who's fantastic. Roddy Rich. We've got Jack Harlow. We've got Charlie Pooth. We've got Janel Monet. We've got Lizzo. I mean, it's really- Company is healthy now. Yeah, the company is healthy. 
[01:15:37.680] - Speaker 1 
Based on the metrics that you look at, how do you feel about the success of the company? Based on the way you measure success? 
[01:15:45.850] - Speaker 2 
I mean, this is the thing I have, Atlantic. I gave birth back to Electra. Great. Electra has a bunch of fantastic artists. 
[01:15:56.600] - Speaker 1 
When did that happen? 
[01:15:58.860] - Speaker 2 
About five years ago. I gave birth to Back to Electra with Greg Nadel running it. We took FBR, Road Runner, and Electra and put them and said, Hey, here are fantastic brands that each have a fantastic logo. How's under you? And so we have 21 pilots. He's got Bailey Zimmerman. Brandi Carlyle is there. She's amazing. Oh, my goodness. She's brilliant. Bam Camino, Rainbow Kit and Surprise, Fall Out Boy came back. You know, Turnstile is that roadrunner. There's just so many fantastic artists, and I'm in a different point in my career. It's so interesting because-You sound as detail-oriented and as excited as ever. No, I am. I am, and I'm in the weeds still. I'm so in the weeds because-So what's different about this point? In this point, even though we get paid off of market share and you're supposed to really chase market share, I'm chasing just great artists, and I just feel like it's going to take care of itself. I feel like I've accomplished a lot in my life, and I'm just like, You know what? I just want to love the artist we have and help them get to the place that they want to go. 
[01:17:17.050] - Speaker 2 
And I'm in the same way with my staff. I'm in that place where I'm like, How do I just help all these young people grow into better young executives? 
[01:17:26.320] - Speaker 1 
How do you find new people to be on the staff? 
[01:17:29.210] - Speaker 2 
My senior Senior staff. It looks for younger folks. 
[01:17:34.190] - Speaker 1 
How much have you seen your staff have been around you for a long time? 
[01:17:37.120] - Speaker 2 
A lot. I have very little turnover. Very little turnover. No one ever wants to leave. We move as such a unit. We go out a lot. We're in it with each other. I still go to see shows four or five nights a week. I'm out. Yeah. And you're out as packed. Last weekend, I had a A seven o'clock show at Mercury Lounge. I was seeing an artist named Nolan Taylor. Then I had a 9:30 show at the Hammerstein. I saw a Bayly Zimmerman. That was Friday night. Saturday night, I went to Brooklyn Steel. That was a weekend. We've been leaning into all this alt country stuff now. So that's a new crew of artists. 
[01:18:22.250] - Speaker 1 
And do you do that based out of Nashville or you do that all based out of New York? 
[01:18:25.350] - Speaker 2 
New York and LA. 
[01:18:26.570] - Speaker 1 
New York and LA. 
[01:18:27.450] - Speaker 2 
And when we need help from Nashville, they help When you see an artist come in excited, fresh-faced, signing, and then they have great success, how do they tend to change, or what are the different ways 
that they might change? This is the interesting thing. Artists that have success always change. And they always say, Oh, I'm not going to change. They all change. There's no way they don't. Some of them, you see the people around them get way more scared to tell them the truth. 
[01:19:03.360] - Speaker 1 
Dangerous. 
[01:19:04.920] - Speaker 2 
I always find that regardless of how big they get, I still feel like my responsibility is always to be as honest as possible, good, bad, and ugly. So it's not just the artist that changes with success. If you find it's the artist and their whole camp changes with success. 
[01:19:28.010] - Speaker 1 
Yeah, and sometimes the camp can change more, and the impact of that is really bad for the artist. Correct. 
[01:19:36.100] - Speaker 2 
And that's something that no one really talks about, is that it's not only the artist that changes a success, it's all of their immediate circle that all of a sudden changes. So you're not just dealing with an artist by themselves and that personality that all of a sudden might be thinking they're right. And again, the music business, I always say it's not about being right or wrong. It's your God, it's your opinion. But then you got to live with the decision you're going to make. And I'm never afraid to live with the decisions I make. But I don't then turn around and accuse people of it didn't work and it was your fault. And I always say this is the problem with the music business. Saying it didn't work is a bad thing. It should always be, hey, if the music didn't connect in a large scale way, it doesn't mean it's not going to connect tomorrow. Because we'll connect in four years. But it's your catalog that you're building. But part of the problem with the business right now is everyone wants instant success, and everyone thinks they can create a viral moment, and none of us can create it. 
[01:20:46.360] - Speaker 1 
Yeah, it happens when it happens. 
[01:20:48.030] - Speaker 2 
It happens when it happens. Make great music. Stand behind it. And don't be afraid to play it. Don't be afraid to share it. Don't be afraid to promote it. 
[01:20:59.550] - Speaker 1 
Do you Do you think that the artist and the label's goals are aligned? 
[01:21:04.620] - Speaker 2 
We're always aligned in that we don't get paid if your shit doesn't work. We're always in alignment, but for some reason, listen, the PR job of the music labels has never been a good... You know that for 100 years. We've always been the big, bad label. By the way, the music isn't as big and as successful. It's never, well, maybe Maybe the song just didn't resonate with your audience. It just didn't resonate the same way that the other songs you made resonated. But artists don't want to accept that. It's always, Well, you didn't do a good enough job promoting or whatever. I've always learned that You know what? For the sake of the relationship, I just take it. I just take it and say, You know what? How do we move forward? 
[01:21:54.250] - Speaker 1 
What does the artist manager do today, 2024? 
[01:21:57.940] - Speaker 2 
It depends on the manager. Some managers are so good and lock arms, and we plan, and we plot, and we scheme together. Some managers are so proactive in the conversations and the planning process and really understanding that there's a global view. And how do we talk about not just here, but the globe? And what do we need to do to operate on a bigger level? And then you have some managers that we're in the right place at the right time and just answer a phone and wait to be told, Hey, this is what's going to happen. 
[01:22:39.470] - Speaker 1 
How does global work for Atlantic? 
[01:22:41.640] - Speaker 2 
So we have an incredible team of people that work with the global marketing team. So when you put content up and music up, it's everywhere at that moment. So the opportunity is really globally. And we don't care where the spark starts. If the spark starts in Brazil, the spark starts in Brazil, if it starts in Taiwan, if it starts in Berlin or the UK, wherever it's going to start, it starts. We have to be ready to meet the moment and fan it and connect this global audience. Because the community that's listening to Charlie Puth in Korea is so important. It's like the community that's in America. And it's just like when content comes out for Charlie, it's just like, he is such a voracious audience in Korea. We need to serve them just as much as we serve the audience in America. So that team has to know when he's putting out music, when he's putting out content, so therefore, they can do the right job of amplifying it in Korea. So 
we're way better organized than we've ever been. It used to be, you used to wait and go market by market. Now we all go, and then you start to see where things are cooking. 
[01:23:58.200] - Speaker 2 
And then we add more gas. 
[01:24:00.410] - Speaker 1 
Fan the flames wherever they're working and then spread it. 
[01:24:02.380] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. 
[01:24:03.220] - Speaker 1 
And it doesn't matter where that is. 
[01:24:04.880] - Speaker 2 
I got this kid right now named Alex Warren. He's got a song, cooking in the Nordics, the Swedish, Denmark, and it's cooking. And it's going. And as soon as we saw the flame, they started pouring more. We started giving them more. And then we shipped the artist over there. And so then all of a sudden, he's now doing promo touring in all of those markets, connecting, making local content with the local influencers over there. And now the song is doing a million streams a day because we saw it, we felt it, we pounced on it. 
[01:24:39.230] - Speaker 1 
Great. 
[01:24:39.920] - Speaker 2 
And now it's going to spread into Germany, and now it's spreading into the UK. And it's here in America. But you need people everywhere ready to go. Everyone's legs moving. No one's standing still. And then that way, that baton is getting moved back and forth. 
[01:24:56.150] - Speaker 1 
How important is radio in 2024? 
[01:24:59.560] - Speaker 2 
You know It's part of the making of a star. All of a sudden, when you're connecting the song and you're going not just online, but it's also on radio and part of the promos, and it's new music from Cardi B or new music from Jack Harlo or whatever. It adds to the overall marketing of not just being one of many. It adds to the connection of the dots when you're playing on a more mainstream level. 
[01:25:36.610] - Speaker 1 
Would you say the artist that's playing on mainstream level is taken more seriously in some way? 
[01:25:41.380] - Speaker 2 
No, absolutely not, because you could be a serious, credible rapper and not necessarily go to urban radio. You take the shots at the right time when you know you have a song that's going to work, that you can build a whole audience with kids. It took us a long time to put a record of Lil Uzi's on radio. We never played the radio game with Lil Uzi. He was building with kids with his music and his content. 
[01:26:12.760] - Speaker 1 
So just consistent releases and videos and shows? 
[01:26:18.030] - Speaker 2 
And from a very early start, he started touring. He did it the old-fashioned way. He started in the small clubs, and he worked. And I'll never forget, we saw we were sniffing him and Kodak Black at the same time, and they both were cooking. And we were both like, Oh, my God. Look at this. We got sparks going on. And we said, Yo, can we put a tour together? Great. And we said, We'll promote it at Atlantic. We'll be the promoter. And we put Uzi and Kodak, and we convinced everybody to do a co-headline, go out. And just as the tour was about to go out on the road, unfortunately, Kodak got arrested. And so then Uzi stayed on the tour without Kodak, but he went out and grinded it out, and kids saw a rock star. And he gave everybody a rock star performance. And he toured and he toured. And he not only toured here, but he went across the pond, and he toured globally. And he built himself into a real proper touring act and made us incredible music. And I think by us not going to at that time, it was just always about the kids and the young kids. 
[01:27:35.040] - Speaker 2 
This was their artist. 
[01:27:36.430] - Speaker 1 
Yeah, it's like an underground secret, but a really big one. 
[01:27:40.300] - Speaker 2 
But a really big one. Yeah. And then at some point, he gave us Exo Tour Life, and the song was so massive. We had to go to radio. 
[01:27:50.070] - Speaker 1 
It was streaming like 30 million times a week. Did you decide to go to radio or did radio decide for you? 
[01:27:55.210] - Speaker 2 
It was so big that it was just like we would have looked like cheap motherfuckers if we didn't take it to radio. Yeah, because it was streaming 30 million times a week back then when nothing was streaming those numbers. And so we had to do it. And then we put them on the MTV Music Awards. There was a moment where it was like, okay, it's time to just put them in some bigger places. But for him, it was just always about the music and touring. He still feels that way. 
[01:28:24.450] - Speaker 1 
I don't know if you can answer this question because of where you sit in the music business, but how would you say the music business different from other businesses? 
[01:28:32.840] - Speaker 2 
Our business is a hard business because you sign these magical creatures and you work with these people that are artists, and you ask them to make product that you then want to try to commercialize as big as possible. And real artists make art for art's sake. We ask musicians to make music and then go out on the road and tour it and promote it and make content and do a lot of work to be part of it. And we want so badly for artists to be big. And we want them to expose their lives and do interviews and tell their story. But artists make music. They They're not necessarily making music to share their lives. And so it's a different business in the sense of the movie business with celebrities. You know what it is with a celebrity. And for us, you want quality control, but you also want people to be prolific. And you're constantly balancing the, Hey, how do I get the most out of an artist? But also you want to preserve their sanity so they can stay also being artists, and you want them to love it. I always say to them, I need you to love the road. 
[01:30:06.150] - Speaker 2 
I want you to love the road. I need this experience to be great because if you don't like touring, then I don't know how we can really be super successful together. So I always try to figure out what is a happy medium when they're on the road touring, how much promo I can get out of them versus their job that's really important, which is to be great at night for the paying customer. But I also want to maximize the 
opportunity of them being in that local marketplace. And so you're just constantly trying to find the right balance. 
[01:30:36.080] - Speaker 1 
And it's different for every artist.Oh. 
[01:30:37.380] - Speaker 2 
My God.Based. 
[01:30:37.560] - Speaker 1 
On their temperament. 
[01:30:39.590] - Speaker 2 
Yes, and their vocal ability. I mean, if they're a singer, you can't have them talk too much. It's just such a unique business that in order to really be a big label, you have to have a decent roster, and you need music, and you need a lot of it, and you need a lot of content, and you need to be pushing on other human beings output, Hey, when's your album? When's your album? 
[01:31:09.160] - Speaker 1 
It also sounds like you're picking the ones who really want to do that. You hope. Well, that's part of the process, but sometimes it turns out not to be the case. 
[01:31:18.200] - Speaker 2 
Yeah. You're meeting people, you're falling in love with their music, and you have a very short time to get married because your engagement process with discovering an act and signing it is a very short period of time. And so how well do you really get to know the artist before you're signing them? And really, at the end of the day, you don't know if this shit's going to work. 
[01:31:44.890] - Speaker 1 
You never know. 
[01:31:45.820] - Speaker 2 
And then when it does work and everyone's like, oh, my God, it's so excited. How do we get more? And then the artist goes in tours for two years, and then they need a break. All of a sudden, everything you've built, now Now it's a four-year hiatus. You lose momentum. All of a sudden, if you are 14, that person is 
now 18. If you're 18, that person is now 22. They've grown up, they're in a different place. But also it's just like the corporation is like, Yo, where's my next album? Because they're so excited. Yeah. And so it's the wonkiest business. 
[01:32:21.060] - Speaker 1 
How has streaming changed the music business? 
[01:32:25.500] - Speaker 2 
Well, the good news is everybody gets every album. So You don't have to compete anymore for 12 bucks or 13 bucks for an album. We saw in the 2000s when people were pushing for streaming to come in, you'd see the reports that people only bought three albums a year or four albums a year. I mean, now people can listen to as many albums as they want. So that's been the greatest thing ever because it doesn't cost you anything to listen to my album. But the only thing is, is that streaming has now allowed everybody, all these companies, to come in to distribute music, right? Because it doesn't cost anything to really hit a button. It's a scalable business. And so there's 12 billion distribution companies that are all for a dollar, will distribute your song. And so now there's like 400,000 songs being delivered every week. And so there's no filter. We've played the role of curator. We find stuff, we believed in it, we backed it, and we said, This is the best of what we're seeing. And then we brought it out, and it was us and the indies. And now anybody and everybody can just put a song up. 
[01:33:44.990] - Speaker 2 
And so the marketplace is so saturated and overcrowded. 
[01:33:51.090] - Speaker 1 
And so-Does the cream still rise to the top, though? 
[01:33:54.190] - Speaker 2 
This is where we have fantastic artists that are playing arenas that may not have giant streaming blow torches. Brandi Carlyle. One of the most magnificent artists to walk the face of this Earth. She is like no other. Her voice, she's one of the greatest performers, and her audience loves her, and she has a loyal audience that listens to her. Her audience has day jobs. Her audience might have families. They can't listen to her album every day after school on the way to the school bus 17 times a week. They might listen to her album once a week on a Sunday when they have time. So they listen to her, but are they listening to her every day, so many times a week? No. It doesn't mean she's not hugely successful. But the cream rises. It's there. She's at the top of her game. That's why you have to look back and look at the big picture of what are you building. 
[01:35:09.830] - Speaker 1 
Who the artist is, who their audience is, and how they're connecting to that audience. 
[01:35:13.640] - Speaker 2 
Absolutely. 
[01:35:14.390] - Speaker 1 
The audiences are not interchangeable or comparable, really. 
[01:35:17.690] - Speaker 2 
No. Young kids have all the time in the world to hit the song and hit repeat and play the song over and over and over again. Morning, noon, and night, because kids don't have necessarily jobs in a family. 
[01:35:29.310] - Speaker 1 
Is the album a dead format? 
[01:35:33.770] - Speaker 2 
No way. No way. It's not a dead format. Not a dead format at all. I just think that each artist, depending on who their audience is, will consume an album, or they won't consume the album. They'll pick off the singles. But it's artist by artist, genre by genre. It's not the same. 
[01:35:55.190] - Speaker 1 
Cardi B has been popular for a long time. I feel like she puts out songs more than albums. How many albums has she put out? One. One. How long has she been around? 
[01:36:10.380] - Speaker 2 
We put the album out in April of 2018. This is the thing. She had her first kid right after we put out album number one, and then she had a second kid. And so getting back in, making an album, she was a young mom.Makes sense. And so she needed time to be a mom and do her thing. 
[01:36:36.680] - Speaker 1 
I'm looking forward to her next album. 
[01:36:38.470] - Speaker 2 
Hopefully this year. That'd be great. But listen, when you're touring and you're trying to sell tickets, you need a body of work. Now, you want to break it up in this new day and age, and you think you want to give us an ERP, an ERP, and an ERP, and you want to break it up. Some artists are like, I don't want to give you the I want to roll 12 songs right now. I want to do a track a month for the next 12 months, and then at the end, compile it. And this is where we're just like, Cool. If that's your vision, how you want to roll, great. And who am I to say no to this artist? 
[01:37:18.470] - Speaker 1 
There's no right way to do it. 
[01:37:19.960] - Speaker 2 
No. But at the end of the day, it all gets compiled. Whether it's on a master playlist, the best of or this is, you still need songs so people will come buy a ticket. 
[01:37:35.290] - Speaker 1 
Are there any jobs in the music business that you haven't done? 
[01:37:39.680] - Speaker 2 
No. I've done every job. Coming up at Def Jam. I think that's why I am a good leader, because I know how hard each job is. And so I'm empathetic to the cause of it's so hard to do promotion. It's so hard to do marketing. It's hard to come up with insane new video concepts and new art concepts that people haven't seen and really trying to get in with the talent and help push them to be the best that they could be. But at the same time, I know it's all really doable, and you can get greatness when you're focused and you give yourself time. And if you're not just flinging shit out, and if you're not last minute, but you plan and you prepare, and you give yourself the time to really dream and get in with talent. And also, you can't move talent if you just come in and out. You got to build real relationships with them. They got to trust you. If you want to push them out of their comfort zone, they have to believe that you're in it with them and that there's trust. But trust only comes from time. 
[01:38:49.390] - Speaker 2 
You got to put the time in. And you can't put the time in by just showing up because they're in New York City or they're in LA. You got to go to West Virginia or Chicago or Detroit, wherever You got to spend time with people. And that's the thing I also know when people are bullshit because they didn't put in the time and they didn't really sit down with talent and get in there. I have empathy, but I also know bullshit when it's bullshit. And so that's the best part about doing every job. You can't tell me, you don't understand. Man, I had no credit card. I mean, Lira put me through it. And that's why I'm saying, when these kids say anything to me, I'm like, Man, you got no idea. We had no cell phones. And then when we did get cell phones, we used to have to itemize the bill. They used to make us write down who every phone call was. 
To make sure it was work-related, that we weren't using the cell phones for personal in '93 because Def Jam. I mean, crazy shit. Shit was hard, man. We didn't have computers when I first started. 
[01:39:59.210] - Speaker 2 
We used to sit there typewriters than Whiteout to write our reports. 
[01:40:06.080] - Speaker 1 
What is the state of hip hop today? 
[01:40:09.270] - Speaker 2 
People want to say that it's not as good. I feel like I've heard this for 30 years where everybody says the generation before was better, right? Or the two generations before were better. But I learned in my own household when my kids were growing up and my son and daughter I remember when my daughter was, oh, my God, all about Lil Wayne, and I would talk to her about Jay-Z, and she didn't want to know that was my music. Lil Wayne was her music. And then Eli was all about Lil Uzi. Everybody likes to look back and think their time was better. But when I go to shows and I see kids losing their mind, supporting the Osama Sons, La Tyler. I've got a young female named Calleigh. I've got Set and Leray. I've got this deal with Gucci at 1017, who signed a bunch of fantastic artists. He gave us Pooh Sheisty. It's just like the kids all need to make their rappers theirs. They don't want yesteriors. And so it's just like, I never sit there and go, Oh, my God, it's not as good. It's different. And thank God it's different. And the sounds are changing. 
[01:41:27.370] - Speaker 2 
If it was all the same, it wouldn't keep going. Yeah, absolutely. It would burn out. It would burn out, but it's amazing. Amazing. I feel like the music business, as much as everybody wants to shit on the majors and complain about it. And I'm always like, why are you so angry? All I'm trying to do is help bring great music to the globe. How did I become the bad guy here? I have a giant piece of art in my office, this big, giant mooseleaf that's nine feet tall by artist, Michael Scuggins. And he wrote a million times, I'm still a good person. I'm still a good person. I'm still a good person. And everybody comes in and everybody looks at this giant, it's this massive piece. And everyone is like, did your kid make this? And I'm like, no, no, no, this is a piece of art. This is my daily affirmation. I'm still a good person. I'm still a good person.
