[00:00:02.240] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. If you can describe the new album.

[00:00:26.970] - Speaker 2
In one word, in one word, what.

[00:00:29.250] - Speaker 1
Would the word be? Think about it.

[00:00:31.290] - Speaker 2
Introspective has been popping up a lot. Every time I described the record, just because I think it's the first time, I'm actually acknowledging situations that have happened to me but through my own eyes, instead of blaming others constantly. And I think that's a lot to do with maturing and growing up. So, yeah, introspective, that's good. Very me.

[00:00:58.330] - Speaker 1
How would you say it's different than what you've done before? How would you describe the differences?

[00:01:03.650] - Speaker 2
I was much confident with this record. I think coming here and meeting you and, like, playing the songs acoustically in, like, on the second day made me appreciate my songwriting more and my decisions. I didn't feel like I needed to, like, put ideas down just for the sake of talking in the studio.

[00:01:24.420] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:01:25.220] - Speaker 2
I felt way more sure of myself and what I wanted.

[00:01:29.190] - Speaker 1
Is it something about that process of putting down the songs by yourself acoustically? It gives them some power. Like, you realize that it's already there.

[00:01:40.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:01:40.720] - Speaker 1
You know, like, the hard work's already done, and now we can have fun making music.

[00:01:44.740] - Speaker 2
Exactly. I feel like, you know, a song is good when it's good completely naked.

[00:01:50.140] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:01:50.580] - Speaker 2
And it's just me and acoustic guitar.

[00:01:52.850] - Speaker 1
Mmm.

[00:01:55.230] - Speaker 2
Have you seen the album cover?

[00:01:56.650] - Speaker 1
I've not.

[00:01:57.350] - Speaker 2
Have you not?

[00:01:58.020] - Speaker 1
Can I see?

[00:01:58.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I've got it every time. Basically, we took loads of pictures of, you know, there was loads of options of me posing very serious, like, poses, and then we chose the one that was the most candid. And it looks like I'm about to, like, speak my heart out. And the sky, I was like, it needs to be blue, because it just reminds me of the sky in Malibu. And it's cool, isn't it?

[00:02:25.470] - Speaker 1
Wow. It's really cool.

[00:02:28.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Looks like I'm about to just.

[00:02:30.260] - Speaker 1
It's really cool.

[00:02:31.900] - Speaker 2
Mm hmm.

[00:02:33.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It feels like you're about to really spill your guts. Yeah, literally, this is like. I mean it.

[00:02:41.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no, 100%. It's like. And it was in the middle of the conversation, I think, and the photographer shot whilst I was speaking to someone.

[00:02:51.400] - Speaker 1
It's beautiful.

[00:02:52.380] - Speaker 2
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

[00:02:54.620] - Speaker 1
What's, um. What's your relationship with social media?

[00:02:59.400] - Speaker 2
I honestly think it's gotten way better. Like, it was very toxic at the beginning, and I think it's normal for, like, a girl my age and who grew up on the Internet to have a toxic relationship with social media. And then at times, as a musician, like, as an artist, you feel quite dependent on, you know, on Instagram, on TikTok, and, like, the views and the comments and the likes. And then I think it's when you create music and when you start appreciating the craft of making music, that's when the anxiety and the pressure of social media start to decrease, and I start not caring. When I was in Shangri la, it was the first time I didn't really give a f about the Internet, which was awesome or how I looked at. And the main thing that social media gave me was just the worst self esteem ever.

[00:03:54.600] - Speaker 1
When did you first get on, and what was the. Tell me your whole history of social media.

[00:03:59.040] - Speaker 2
When I was like, hmm, probably 1313. I got Instagram, and at first, I used it so innocently. I did these things where I make these random stop motion videos, and I was a pretty, like. Like, I didn't have much friends, and I just, like, liked weird shit. And then when I tried fitting in, that's when they started really taking social media seriously. And I was like, I gotta look hot. Like, I gotta, like, dress a certain way, blah, blah. And then I started listening to music I still love to this day. And I gained a lot of followers. And then I started making music. And I think having the followers from Instagram really helped, you know, my music to get across to people.

[00:04:45.030] - Speaker 1
Do you think had you not already been on social media, you would have never started making music?

[00:04:51.070] - Speaker 2
No. I think the reason why I made music was way more. Was much more emotional. I felt like I needed. There were so many things I had to say, and I just didn't know how to say it. And it was like, in between the period where I was. I got kicked out of school and I was trying to get into another school, and my dad literally looked at me and he was like, you look so depressed. Like, I need to get you a guitar or something. Like, it was kind of just, we have to do something for b. And then I picked up a guitar and I wrote coffee. Just two chords, and I was like, I needed something.

[00:05:20.600] - Speaker 1
Would you say the guitar acted as therapy for you?

[00:05:23.090] - Speaker 2
Oh, 100%.

[00:05:24.270] - Speaker 1
That's amazing.

[00:05:25.520] - Speaker 2
It still is. It still is. Every song on this record, as you know, is so deeply personal. And at times, I get listened to it, and I'm like. I'm actually quite terrified about releasing this.

[00:05:39.820] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I feel like even in its personal nature, you write in a poetic enough way where it's not like, when I listen to it, I feel like this is for everybody. It's not so personal that it's myopic.

[00:05:55.710] - Speaker 2
That's awesome.

[00:05:56.420] - Speaker 1
It's like human experience.

[00:05:58.490] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I want it to relate to other people. I think that's what makes me feel less alone.

[00:06:05.790] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like before guitar, it was hard to be heard?

[00:06:12.580] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah, 100%. Well, I was playing the violin, so.

[00:06:17.610] - Speaker 1
You really couldn't be heard.

[00:06:18.610] - Speaker 2
It really couldn't be heard. And plus, I was doing a lot of things that I didn't really want to do, and I just felt a little bit lost. I couldn't really communicate my feelings very well. I still can't communicate very well at times, but I think since writing music, it gives me more of an understanding of myself, really. And despite me not knowing how to communicate very well, at least I understand what I'm trying to say without having to say it.

[00:06:43.840] - Speaker 1
Can you tell me why you got kicked out of school?

[00:06:48.160] - Speaker 2
Well, it's weird, you know, because I don't think there was a particular reason, because they asked me to come back, because I think they realized it was a bit illegal what they did, because they kicked me out in the middle of the school year. So they kicked a bunch of girls out, essentially, and all of us struggled to get into another school because they just randomly kicked us out. And I guess it was for a bunch of reasons. I did skip a lot of lessons, but I never got in trouble for it. I used to smoke in the toilets, but they used to make jokes about it, so they knew about. They were like, oh, you're having a cheeky cigarette. And I'm like, yeah. And it would always be so chill. Then all of a sudden, they hated it. I don't know, but I kind of. I don't regret that happening to me. I feel like it's definitely. It meant something in my life.

[00:07:40.130] - Speaker 1
It's interesting that they kicked out a bunch of people at the same time.

[00:07:43.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's weird, because all the girls that they kicked out. Yeah. Were quite similar. They were. They all did therapy.

[00:07:51.230] - Speaker 1
Were you all friends?

[00:07:52.470] - Speaker 2
No, no, no. It was just a bunch of random girls. But we all did therapy. We didn't do very well, I guess, grade wise. And I think just. I'm just trying to find, like, a similarity between us, and we. We weren't necessarily the richest girls of the school, either, so I thought that was quite interesting. And then they were getting threatened to get sued, so they called all the girls back, and I said no, obviously.

[00:08:20.380] - Speaker 1
And what did you do after that? Did you find another school?

[00:08:22.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I managed to find another school. I got into another school, and it was much different because I came from, like, you know, an all girl catholic school. And I just entered this not necessarily rough, but, like, fairly rougher school in west London. And it was mixed, and I've never really communicated with men, so I was, you know, surrounded by very different people. And ironically, I felt more accepted there than I ever did in an all girl catholic school.

[00:08:53.700] - Speaker 1
So it felt like a good experience.

[00:08:55.250] - Speaker 2
Yeah, totally worth it.

[00:08:56.830] - Speaker 1
Interesting. What's it like going from one group of friends and then being taken out of it and putting into a new group of strangers? I guess you had that, too when you moved to the US? Or. How old were you when you moved to the US?

[00:09:07.650] - Speaker 2
Oh, to the UK.

[00:09:08.510] - Speaker 1
To the UK.

[00:09:09.020] - Speaker 2
I'm sorry.

[00:09:10.070] - Speaker 1
How old were you when you moved to the US?

[00:09:11.400] - Speaker 2
Three years old.

[00:09:12.560] - Speaker 1
So you didn't have a big.

[00:09:14.060] - Speaker 2
I was pretty much London girl. But I think, you know what? I still have my friends from my girl school, and I'm still friends with them. They're the first people I'm seeing as soon as they get back to London. And I still spoke to them every day when I moved to school. I'm, like, grateful and thankful that I've managed to find an amazing group of girlfriends. And then the boys that I made friends with in that school, like, you know, we still follow each other on Instagram, and, like, I don't really see them as much, but, you know, it was definitely an experience. Like, I think I'm. I would like to think I'm good at adapting to situations.

[00:09:51.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah. What would you say the main difference between an all girls school and a mixed school was?

[00:09:58.230] - Speaker 2
Well, it's much cruder in a mixed school. I see there's a lot of weird stuff.

[00:10:04.390] - Speaker 1
Do the girls act differently?

[00:10:06.370] - Speaker 2
Um, no. Okay. If I'm being honest, the girls in the mixed school way chiller. Way chiller. Like, they didn't really. You know, there was no, like, competition. It was very relaxed. I think in all girls schools, women, like, the girls in the school were very uptight. There was a lot of competitiveness, a lot of jealousy about what kind of things? Boys.

[00:10:32.460] - Speaker 1
There's no boys there.

[00:10:33.800] - Speaker 2
I know, but there was, like, two other boys schools next to us.

[00:10:36.760] - Speaker 1
I see.

[00:10:37.620] - Speaker 2
It was ridiculous. Like, there was, like, you know, the first time I got with, like, my first boyfriend, I remember a girl coming up to me being like, oh, my God. Like, no wonder he's gotten with you. And I'm like, why? I'm like, cause you look like an asian version of the girl that he liked before. And I was like, what the hell? Wow, that's so weird. Yeah, weird, weird atmosphere. My girlfriends, thankfully, all lovely. All lovely. And without them, I probably wouldn't make the music I make today.

[00:11:08.950] - Speaker 1
Did you find your first boyfriend at school?

[00:11:11.340] - Speaker 2
No, I met him. I don't know. He was in a neighboring school. But I think we met through the Internet, and friends are friends.

[00:11:22.730] - Speaker 1
Tell me, the putting out music for the first time, how did you start doing it?

[00:11:30.190] - Speaker 2
Um, well, I did it as a joke to begin with.

[00:11:34.710] - Speaker 1
Hence the name.

[00:11:35.530] - Speaker 2
Hence the name. Oh, God, don't do that. And I made friends with a boy called Oscar because I knew he was in an all boys school that was, like, neighboring schools with my school. And I thought it was really cool that he made his own music and he managed to release it online. I was like, oh, my God, how does he do that? So we became friends on the Internet, and we met up and we just started recording music together. He would, like, I'd write the songs and he just, you know, he recorded it and he put it out online for me. So, yeah, he's really great. I still know him. He's great friends.

[00:12:09.790] - Speaker 1
And then what was the reaction when it started?

[00:12:13.400] - Speaker 2
It was pretty surreal because, obviously, like, the whole idea of it being a joke was like, I'm putting this out for my friends. Like, obviously, I love the song, but, you know, it's quite, like, a funny thing to do. It's quite random.

[00:12:25.340] - Speaker 1
And then how old were you at that point?

[00:12:27.750] - Speaker 2
Like, 1717. And I remember, like, I. All the comments on my instagram started changing. I was like, you're that coffee girl. I was like, I have never worked in a cafe ever in my life. Why am I the coffee girl? And then I realized, oh, crap. I released a song called coffee. Like, do you think they're talking about the song coffee? And, yeah, I realized they were, and I thought it was pretty cool.

[00:12:51.490] - Speaker 1
Tell me about the song. Why did you write a song called coffee?

[00:12:54.320] - Speaker 2
You know what's crazy? I hate coffee. I don't even drink coffee. But I, you know, I was going through, like, my first love and, like, high school romance and, you know, I was a 17 year old girl. Like, I'm gonna write a love song about how I'm making my boyfriend coffee, even though I've never made coffee in my life.

[00:13:16.540] - Speaker 1
But it was just like a fantasy. Yeah, a fantasy story.

[00:13:20.100] - Speaker 2
Mm hmm. Yeah.

[00:13:21.800] - Speaker 1
So the coffee is not coffee.

[00:13:23.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think it's love.

[00:13:28.320] - Speaker 1
And do you remember the first time you played music in front of people.

[00:13:31.470] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:32.100] - Speaker 1
What was that like?

[00:13:32.760] - Speaker 2
There's still a video of it on YouTube, and I hate it so much. I like. And it wasn't even, like, my show was, like, I was doing, like, a joint show with Oscar and his band, and he'd play a song, and then I'd play a song, and then he'd play a song, and I'd play a song. I only played two songs. And I remember there's a couple kids in the crowd that, you know, traveled all the way to see me, which is really sweet. But in this video, I'm standing, like, the most awkward stance I've ever seen someone stand. It was like, really? I just looked so strange, and it was so nervous. I felt like I was almost gonna faint before I went on stage, but I did.

[00:14:13.740] - Speaker 1
How many. How many people were there?

[00:14:15.440] - Speaker 2
Probably like, 20. Yeah, like, there wasn't many people. It wasn't my. I was supporting another band, but, yeah, there was a couple of, like, industry people there that came and saw me, so I was like, yeah, but even.

[00:14:30.060] - Speaker 1
Playing in front of 20 people when you haven't done it before, it's really intimidating.

[00:14:35.010] - Speaker 2
It's terrifying. Yeah. Honestly, ironically, I think that's way more intimidating than playing to, like, a massive crowd. Cause you can see every single face.

[00:14:44.260] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And in some ways, the bigger the crowd, the less faces you see. It's more just like, looking at the ocean, basically.

[00:14:51.690] - Speaker 2
Oh, it looks like a green screen. Like, it doesn't feel real. Like, when I played the Taylor shows, I was like, everything is two d, and I'm just looking at, like, a photograph right now.

[00:15:01.070] - Speaker 1
What was the biggest show you played before the Taylor shows? The most people you'd played, too?

[00:15:06.290] - Speaker 2
I think I was supporting the night 75. I played one of their arena shows, and that was a pretty big stage. And I remember playing the zero two and being terrified. And I was like, the only way to not get scared is if I just wear a really silly t shirt. And they wore a nickelback top. And I was like, sick. I'm gonna roll with this. And, yeah, I, like, lost all the nerves as soon as I got on stage, which was nice.

[00:15:31.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah. As soon as you start singing, it stops.

[00:15:33.660] - Speaker 2
Yeah, well, not for Taylor. That was the exception. Cause for ages, I was like, oh, it's gonna be chill. And then every single, like, night we played, I was absolutely shitting it. I just couldn't typically.

[00:15:46.760] - Speaker 1
What was the size of those audiences?

[00:15:50.100] - Speaker 2
I don't even. I'm bad with remembering numbers, but they were stadiums. So there was a lot.

[00:15:57.880] - Speaker 1
How many of the people there do you think had ever heard you before?

[00:16:00.890] - Speaker 2
Not a lot.

[00:16:01.810] - Speaker 3
Not a lot.

[00:16:03.090] - Speaker 2
Not a lot.

[00:16:03.990] - Speaker 1
Is that difficult?

[00:16:05.300] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. Cause you're, like, almost trying to win everyone over.

[00:16:08.090] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And it's so long distance. It's difficult.

[00:16:12.530] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:16:13.110] - Speaker 1
It's not intimate.

[00:16:14.050] - Speaker 2
Oh, no. Also, there's a massive Runway right in front of me that I can't really use because I'm playing guitar, so I'm just. And then there's these massive screens with your face on it right in front of you. So you're, like, singing.

[00:16:27.250] - Speaker 1
Can you see it?

[00:16:28.510] - Speaker 2
Unfortunately.

[00:16:29.570] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:16:30.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And every time I looked at her, I was like, I had to tell them to turn off for me. So some nights they did, and then I got used to it. But the first couple nights, I kept looking at my face and being like, I look so bad right now. Like, this is so horrible. But, I mean, you get used to it. But I was still so nervous.

[00:16:48.760] - Speaker 1
How did those gigs come about?

[00:16:51.110] - Speaker 2
Um, well, the last time I saw Taylor, I saw her at an award show, and I was, like, trying to build up the courage to go meet her. And then she came up to me, and she was just like, I listened to your ep all the time, like, there's no skips. And I was like, oh, my God, this is not real. And then from that, like, I realized, you know, she listened to my music, which was awesome. And then she, like, made. She made a video to one of my songs, see you soon, and I thought that was awesome. And then I remember doing an interview and someone asking me, oh, like, who's your dream, like, person to support? And I said, the strokes or Taylor Swift? And so I feel like I manifest it into existence.

[00:17:30.650] - Speaker 1
So cool. What makes the strokes happen next, exactly? Has it changed beyond the Taylor audience being different than everything before that? How many years have you been on stage now? Not long.

[00:17:51.650] - Speaker 2
Well, since I was, like, 17.

[00:17:53.860] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And how old are you now?

[00:17:55.230] - Speaker 2
23. I have to think about that.

[00:17:57.450] - Speaker 1
So five years?

[00:17:58.820] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:17:59.610] - Speaker 1
You feel like your relationship to it has changed over the five years?

[00:18:03.560] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I feel like I. I definitely know what to do.

[00:18:09.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:18:09.560] - Speaker 2
And it's not like you can't just kind of, like, stumble on stage and pick up a guitar and play. You want to. There needs to be preparation. Like, you need to be healthy. You need to take care of yourself. You can't go on a night out. Be as much as you want to go out and get fucked up. You have to take care of yourself. And I think that's why I learned is being sensible.

[00:18:30.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Did you have any bad shows based on going out?

[00:18:34.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really bad. A lot of things I mean, I don't regret because I think I learned a lot from it, but a lot of tours that have been canceled, a lot of shows that I couldn't do because I was too ill, because I've either been overworking or overworking on top of going out a lot.

[00:18:54.380] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like you're missing out on anything or. No.

[00:18:57.460] - Speaker 2
You know, that used to be a massive thing for me. I used the craziest fomo. I remember, like, having loads of conversations with my boyfriend, being like, I just feel like I've missed out out on so much life cause of tour. And all my friends tell me all these stories. And then, you know what's funny is that it was when I got to here and I worked on this album here, and I was like, I'm in a place where it's really hard to get into, like, harder than any other club in London, any other party. And it was the first time I didn't feel any fomo at all. Like, there were so many parties going on in LA, and, like, we'd be like, we'd finish, like, working in the studio, we'd be, like, chilling in the living room, and we were like, should we go? And I'm like, no, duh. Can we stay here?

[00:19:42.200] - Speaker 1
Like, that's a great thing about being in a comfortable place.

[00:19:45.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:19:46.450] - Speaker 1
It's not like you're looking for something outside of it.

[00:19:49.330] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no, 100%. Always so sunny here as well. Like, why would I leave?

[00:19:54.130] - Speaker 3
Yeah, it's so beautiful.

[00:19:55.660] - Speaker 2
Why would I leave?

[00:19:56.840] - Speaker 1
It's so beautiful. Do you have any memories of the Philippines before coming to London?

[00:20:03.650] - Speaker 2
Hmm.

[00:20:04.710] - Speaker 1
Did you come right to London or just uk?

[00:20:08.470] - Speaker 2
Right to London.

[00:20:09.270] - Speaker 1
Right to London.

[00:20:10.090] - Speaker 2
But I did visit a lot, like, every single summer. I spent all my summers in the Philippines.

[00:20:16.310] - Speaker 1
How different is life there?

[00:20:18.670] - Speaker 2
You know what's strange? It's very similar to here. It's a very relaxed. Well, where I live, like, Iloilo, it's like a little island, a lot of nature. You're near, like, Boracay, you know, the sea. So it's very chill, peaceful. And London is go, go, go all the time. But my most earliest memory, I think, is just hanging out with my grandma and, like, hanging out and just outside. It was always, always outside, which is cool. I feel like it's just, well, it's much safer around that area. I live definitely way more than the area I live in London. I would not be letting my kids walk around barefoot in London.

[00:21:05.020] - Speaker 1
Could you imagine ever moving back?

[00:21:07.410] - Speaker 2
I thought about that. I was actually thinking. I was saying the other day that once I get pregnant, I kind of want to be pregnant on the beach.

[00:21:14.660] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[00:21:15.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I raised the first couple years with my kid on Boracay or somewhere in Iloilo and then probably move back to London.

[00:21:25.680] - Speaker 1
What would you say is the most fun part of your job?

[00:21:28.390] - Speaker 2
The most fun part of my job, I think getting to just, like, getting to do what I want to do. So getting to write music, so, like, getting to earn money from my hobby, which is crazy, because it's like, I can buy a house. I can do all these things just from doing something I love and, like. And not just something I love, but something I. If I'm speaking honestly, like, something I depend on.

[00:21:59.570] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Would you say you primarily write songs? You're a songwriter or you're a recording artist, or you're a live performer? What would be the order in your mind? Like, how do you think of yourself?

[00:22:22.530] - Speaker 2
Probably the way it's like songwriter.

[00:22:24.510] - Speaker 1
Songwriter first.

[00:22:25.390] - Speaker 2
Songwriter first always. And then recording artists and then live.

[00:22:30.200] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Cause there are some artists who think of the show as the whole thing, and they make a new album to get to do the show.

[00:22:36.610] - Speaker 2
I guess so. Cause I think a lot of people always have in mind, like, oh, I wanna make x type of music because this is how I want it to sound like live. It was quite similar with my first record, fake it flowers. I was playing all these arena shows, and I was like, I want to make an album that can fill an arena.

[00:22:51.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:22:52.970] - Speaker 2
But then, you know, that changes. Like, stuff changes when I grow up. And I just wanted to. I realized all I wanted to do was write music.

[00:23:00.310] - Speaker 1
I think also, once you have the songs, you can present them in a way that they work in different environments.

[00:23:06.150] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yeah. You can, like, make whatever you will from once it's born to.

[00:23:10.530] - Speaker 1
What do you think is the most difficult part of your job?

[00:23:12.980] - Speaker 2
I think the most difficult part is getting. Is growing up and learning in this position, like, learning about life at the position I'm in. Like, not being able to experience certain things, like, not being able to see my family a lot of the time, like, putting myself in uncomfortable situations. And, like, it's strange because, you know, when my friends talk about, like, how they've learned to live life, it's like all these, like, pinnacle moments of, like, teenage. Like, being a teenager, then going to college, and then, you know, and then working a nine to five job. And it's so different with me because I'm like, I had to learn all that on tour. And the first thing I did as soon as I left school, Washington. Get on the road for about two months. And that was really difficult. I like, yeah, it was really difficult.

[00:24:15.390] - Speaker 1
How is success different than you might have imagined it?

[00:24:21.790] - Speaker 2
I guess it's different in a lot of ways. I just. I was always scared of, like, the big world of, like, being successful and being a musician. I didn't know what that meant. Like, that was so far removed from who I was as a person. So when I had it, I didn't understand it. And I think that's what was so scary about it. Like, I wasn't sure I knew how to navigate through life with it. And then you realize it's really not that bad if you just keep the right people around you when you keep grounded and you stay the same. I still feel like the same 15 year old girl I was, and so, like, it is scary if you make it scary.

[00:25:04.120] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think this is related to what you just said. Would you say you feel more yourself now, or did you feel more yourself when you were 15?

[00:25:13.970] - Speaker 2
Oh, I feel way more myself now. Yeah, way more myself. I feel, like, on the way, obviously, it wasn't like a. I was growing into myself. Definitely had dips and, like, went through crazy hair changes, like, crazy clothes changes. I didn't know who I was. But now I feel the most myself I've ever felt, which is really nice.

[00:25:38.000] - Speaker 1
That's great. Would you say you feel comfortable with yourself?

[00:25:40.200] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's great. I feel sure it's the happiest I've been in a long time. And that's ironic, because a lot of things had happened to me the past year, and, you know, I had to acknowledge a lot of feelings, you know, that I kind of buried along the way, but I think that just honestly helps accepting myself more.

[00:26:01.750] - Speaker 1
So what do people believe about you that's not true?

[00:26:07.550] - Speaker 2
I don't know. I'm not so sure. There's always these. I always see these things where people have all these assumptions about me. I try not to think about it so much. I mean, like, people say I was confident. I was like, I'm more confident, but then when I speak, I feel confident with my words, and I make music. So I, like, I'm always gonna not feel confident. Hate myself sometimes, and, like, feel like the ugliest human being on earth, and that's completely normal. But I don't think that makes me less confident. People think, I don't know, I could be mean, and I can be meand, but I can also be nice. So. I don't know. Assumptions are weird. I try not to think about it so much because it just like I used to, and I would hate myself way more.

[00:26:53.580] - Speaker 1
So should we listen through to the. Will you play me songs?

[00:26:58.030] - Speaker 2
Hell, yeah.

[00:26:58.780] - Speaker 1
You have the album.

[00:26:59.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I do. I got the newest version. I'm so, so happy about it. I cannot even explain. Like, is this lightning dab my connecting?

[00:27:11.130] - Speaker 1
That's the whole reason to make it. It's like that feeling of, like, okay, yeah, I had this vision for it. And you get to the end of it and you see it through that feeling of completion and being proud of it and. Yeah, it honestly doesn't matter what anyone thinks after.

[00:27:25.440] - Speaker 2
Exactly. I love it.

[00:27:26.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And that was the goal. That was the job.

[00:27:28.760] - Speaker 2
That was the goal.

[00:27:29.550] - Speaker 1
That was the job.

[00:27:30.930] - Speaker 2
And it made me feel so much better about, like, myself and life in general that I was like, okay, I feel like I've completed this record. Whatever happens next is it's out of.

[00:27:40.170] - Speaker 1
Your hands, because it is reality.

[00:27:42.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So true. And I think that's music in a nutshell.

[00:27:46.020] - Speaker 1
Yes. All right, let's listen right from the top.

[00:27:49.610] - Speaker 2
Go through the whole thing song by song or. Okay. Awesome.

[00:27:53.760] - Speaker 1
And we stop each one and talk about them.

[00:27:55.530] - Speaker 2
Cool.

[00:28:08.020] - Speaker 3
Sure. It's easy to talk. But I take it and I eat it with a cherry. I'm talking indulging in situations that are fabricated imagination moments that six to exist only want to fix it with a kiss on the lips but I think I might take a fire I wanted to see the world and color to your eyes and through your mind I think that I like to see and wonder through the night I think I do it all over again it gets harder to breathe but I take it and I want it and I love when I please cause I'm craving expectations that are unintainable I guess I'll just taste it but what's the point of trying if it turns into lush? Cause I think I might take a bite I wanted it to the world feel your eyes I think that I like to sit and wander through the night I think I might.

[00:29:43.050] - Speaker 2
Want to.

[00:29:43.550] - Speaker 3
Do it all over again through your eyes and through your mind I think that I like to sit and wander through the night I think I might wanna do it all over again.

[00:30:37.220] - Speaker 2
Tell.

[00:30:37.590] - Speaker 1
Me the story of writing it.

[00:30:40.340] - Speaker 2
You know, I used to hate it. I used to hate the song. And now it's the first single and I love it. Wow.

[00:30:46.100] - Speaker 1
What changed?

[00:30:47.430] - Speaker 2
So I wrote the chords like, a year ago, probably exactly a year ago today in LA, and I didn't know what to do with them at first. I was like, oh, should it be a slow song? And we tried making a demo, and I was like, to Jacob, I was like, I kind of want the beat to go doom, doom, doom. And then I hated that. And I was like, we should go back to, like, the original kind of rhythm. And Jake was like, no, no, I love that. I love that. And I was like, okay. And then that's when I started losing love. And then he made a demo to it back in London and added, you know, this, like, beautiful piano, and, like, just kind of brought it to life a bit. And then they wrote the lyrics to it.

[00:31:31.200] - Speaker 1
So you wrote the lyrics to this groove, this version, essentially.

[00:31:35.120] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And I don't really do that much in music. It's always like, I write on guitar all at once, at the same time. And what I like about doing writing to a demo is that you can play around with it a bit more. And I decided that I wanted to sing differently. I wanted it to be direct. I want it to have a different flow. I've never really sang in that flow before. I want it to be a little bit sexier than my usual stuff. But, yeah, it's cool. I think it's cool.

[00:32:10.050] - Speaker 1
What are the lyrics about?

[00:32:12.080] - Speaker 2
God. Well, it's about. It's about me being toxic. I think it's acknowledging what I do in relationships, and you learn later on in the album why I do that and where it stems from. But this song is me acknowledging. I tend to find a comfort in chaotic things, and so my mind goes to a different place when I'm in a relationship. I, like, almost make things up. Like, I am in the most healthiest, most loveliest relationship ever, and I will find anything wrong with it just so I can feel normal again.

[00:32:52.910] - Speaker 1
I see.

[00:32:53.760] - Speaker 2
And I've realized it's so unhealthy to do that. And, like, I've, you know, been in relationships before and I've done the same thing, and it's just time to just finally nip in the body.

[00:33:04.560] - Speaker 1
Is it only in relationships, or is it rooted in, like, what's your relationship with your parents?

[00:33:08.930] - Speaker 2
Like, I love my mom and dad, but I think they're like any other human beings that make mistakes, and I was their first kid. All they were doing was just trying to figure things out.

[00:33:21.980] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:33:22.540] - Speaker 2
And so do you feel like they.

[00:33:24.580] - Speaker 1
Weren'T equipped to be parents.

[00:33:26.320] - Speaker 2
Not so much. I think. I think it's understandable. Imagine moving from the Philippines to the UK and, like, never. Never even flying out to Europe ever.

[00:33:36.440] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Why did they. Why did they decide to move?

[00:33:39.690] - Speaker 2
Because of me. They wanted me to have a better education.

[00:33:42.390] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[00:33:43.180] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So they left. We had a good life there.

[00:33:45.610] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:33:46.020] - Speaker 2
I. Like. We had, you know, quite a bit of money. My dad had a good job, but they started from scratch in the UK and they were.

[00:33:54.550] - Speaker 1
That's really difficult.

[00:33:55.960] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Like, my dad used to tell me stories and he was, like. When he was getting jobs, he was trying to get jobs. He had, like, an amazing job in the Philippines, but he was, like, queuing up for Nike. And he didn't have a baby. They couldn't afford a babysitter, so I'd be queuing up with him. And I was only about three years old, so he'd, like, be carrying me in this massive queue. Yeah.

[00:34:15.890] - Speaker 1
It's a beautiful story. They clearly really love you if they give up their life for you.

[00:34:20.330] - Speaker 2
Exactly, exactly. So it's like, you know, as much as they are human beings, of course, and they figure themselves out and everyone makes mistakes, and I think. But inevitably, the things that I'd been through when I was a kid, they're always gonna rub off on me in terms of my current relationships. And so I have a weird comfort to chaos. And the song is about that.

[00:34:47.050] - Speaker 1
Yeah. I think acknowledging it really helps heal it.

[00:34:51.720] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Like writing music is that. It's like, I have no idea how to communicate these feelings. I know I do them. I'm never going to admit them to my partner, but I can admit it in a song.

[00:35:03.170] - Speaker 1
Yes.

[00:35:03.740] - Speaker 2
At least.

[00:35:04.120] - Speaker 1
Isn't that interesting? Especially when the song is public, millions of people can hear it and it's okay, but saying it to the person is difficult.

[00:35:13.930] - Speaker 2
I know.

[00:35:14.590] - Speaker 1
It's an amazing thing. You think it has to do with the music. What do you think makes that okay or feel okay, I should say.

[00:35:24.670] - Speaker 2
I think you're at your most vulnerable state when you write a song. And I'm always by myself. I'm always in a room. It's just me and my guitar, or it's me in the demo over this. And so I feel like the possibilities are endless and no one is watching, and I can say whatever I want. And. Like, in that moment.

[00:35:44.040] - Speaker 1
Like your diary.

[00:35:44.940] - Speaker 2
Exactly. In that specific moment, like, the people who are going to listen to it in the future just do not matter. It's just me. And then I go through the repercussions when I release the song.

[00:35:58.390] - Speaker 1
Has that ever happened? Have you. Have there been repercussions from anything you've said in a song that has.

[00:36:02.880] - Speaker 3
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:03.710] - Speaker 1
Created drama in your life?

[00:36:05.110] - Speaker 2
Oh, my God. Are you joking? You know the whole story. Don't. I don't.

[00:36:08.380] - Speaker 1
I don't.

[00:36:09.490] - Speaker 2
One of the songs of the album that is, like, about my breakup and what happened in that breakup called this is how it went. Yeah, that and I wrote. Yeah, that whole song is about the repercussions of some of me doing what I love to do and me doing essentially my job and. Yeah, I've definitely had that. Definitely had a couple of messages. It's hard. It's so hard being a musician.

[00:36:42.020] - Speaker 1
We'll get to that one.

[00:36:43.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:36:43.450] - Speaker 1
What's next? I think it's cool hearing them in order.

[00:36:47.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's cool. Let me know.

[00:36:49.070] - Speaker 1
Can you remember it? Can you remember the order in order?

[00:36:51.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah. California. Yeah, a little bit. And I get lost in the middle.

[00:36:56.340] - Speaker 1
Are you gonna put the original intro that you had? You had a really nice intro on the demo you sent.

[00:37:02.150] - Speaker 2
No, we're not. We're going straight in. We'll take a vine.

[00:37:04.570] - Speaker 1
Really?

[00:37:04.890] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:37:05.320] - Speaker 1
Because I like that intro.

[00:37:06.380] - Speaker 2
Oh, really? I really do. Damn it. I do love that intro. Jacob made it, actually.

[00:37:10.790] - Speaker 1
It's very beautiful. It just sets a tone for something. It feels like something important's gonna happen after it.

[00:37:17.800] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll know version for the intro. And. We've got time, we got time we've got time.

[00:37:34.570] - Speaker 3
Spending too much time out of California? And for all this time I've been waiting for you won't you call me a curb so I can finally get back? Never felt bad I've never felt bad? Always the same from the inside wanted a change, took a big sigh, calling it bluff you'll see it real time wish you could see it's been a rough ride a square drive, a square drive gotta fracture heart always thought you knew that then you said from the start guess that's how you do that now you're stuck in the past I'm tired of living so fast it's not the plan, you wouldn't understand all of the things on the inside wanting to change, a different big fight, calling it blood? You'll see a real time wish you could see it's been a rough ride, a sweat right sweater keeping it quiet till I hit back? And I know they won't listen till I start a crack? And I pick up the pieces of what they left? And I know keep it quiet to. I head back and I know they won't listen till I start a crack and I pick up the pieces of what they left and I know they'll never know they'll never know they'll never know.

[00:40:18.160] - Speaker 1
Tell me the story of that one.

[00:40:19.950] - Speaker 2
I love this one. That bridge is one of my favorite.

[00:40:23.090] - Speaker 1
It's so cool.

[00:40:23.940] - Speaker 2
I can't wait to play that live. Like, that's the one thing I'm like, this is gonna slap lives. The meaning behind it essentially is about tool and how I'm always encountering California, and I struggled a lot with coming to terms that, oh, God, it's part of my job to do this, like, going on tour a lot. But it came to a point where I was doing it too much, and I was getting. I was getting put onto a lot of shows and a lot of tours, and on top of that, I was doing press on top of the shows, and it was getting so intense, and I think it took a lot of courage for me to be like, I cannot do it like this. Like, but I don't regret doing all the tours and having to go through all the stress of that. I think it definitely made me realize what I wanted, and it's like, I can do three weeks, max.

[00:41:15.170] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:41:15.520] - Speaker 2
And that's it. And it took a long time for me to realize that and to say that I was getting sick of it.

[00:41:22.750] - Speaker 1
The beauty of that is you want to do it for a long time.

[00:41:25.630] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:41:26.160] - Speaker 1
And if you burn out and start not liking it.

[00:41:29.330] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly.

[00:41:29.890] - Speaker 1
Then it stops.

[00:41:30.770] - Speaker 2
Exactly. The more I like, if I'm on tour for three months, I'm never gonna want to go back for the next year, like, because it's literally every single day show, especially if they're not putting on a lot of, like, days where you're chilling. There was not a lot of, like, free days.

[00:41:52.050] - Speaker 1
Have you ever had trouble singing a show?

[00:41:54.030] - Speaker 2
Oh, 100%.

[00:41:55.180] - Speaker 1
What. What is the, like, sick or, uh.

[00:41:59.010] - Speaker 2
I think all you could think of really, like, being sick, like, feeling depressed.

[00:42:03.390] - Speaker 1
Like, feeling to be emotional.

[00:42:05.120] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Emotional. Or just, like, tired or overworked. It was. I was very unhealthy at one point, and, I mean, I started going on tour when I was really young and, like. And when I went on tour, I did this one, the first UK tour I ever did. I was getting smashed every single night. Every single night. It was ridiculous. I was making the worst decisions. I was doing, like, a lot of drugs, and, yeah, it was. It took a massive toll on my singing voice. 100%. And I got so used to that lifestyle that I kind of put tour in this box where I was like, tor is when I can go and go out and get fucked up all the time. Right? So it's not really work. So it's sick. So that's kind of how I saw tour for ages. But it's not that you have to take care of yourself. You have to exercise. You have to save your voice. Like, you have to be sensitive.

[00:43:00.330] - Speaker 1
It's like being an athlete.

[00:43:01.500] - Speaker 2
Exactly. No, exactly.

[00:43:03.020] - Speaker 1
You have to show up and do your gig right. And it's hard.

[00:43:06.940] - Speaker 2
Literally, it's so hard. And I now I do, like, ballet twice a week and I train twice a week. And that's really helped. Like, my stamina on stage. Like, I'd find myself, like, I'd be performing for, like, an hour and, like, halfway through, like. Because, you know, I, like, you know, I need to quit smoking still, but it's just, like, bad habits and it's just. Yeah, it's hard. It's tough. A lot of sacrifices have to be made.

[00:43:32.160] - Speaker 1
How different is it when you're in a place at a high altitude? Do you notice a difference?

[00:43:36.290] - Speaker 2
Oh, my God. Yeah, my ears. Because obviously, like, where in ears? Yeah, I don't think. Well, my voice gets drier depending on the weather, but I don't think it affects my voice. It affects my hearing. Affects my hearing so much. And also, I just have a really bad time on flights with my ears anyways, so, yeah, it's really bad.

[00:43:56.990] - Speaker 1
I have some tricks to share later.

[00:43:58.800] - Speaker 2
Oh, really?

[00:43:59.550] - Speaker 1
Because I used to have ear problems on flights and no more.

[00:44:02.590] - Speaker 2
Oh, really? Yeah. Cause I am kicking and screaming on flights.

[00:44:06.360] - Speaker 1
I have some good techniques.

[00:44:07.740] - Speaker 2
Okay, awesome. Yeah, I need that because I'm literally getting on a flight after this.

[00:44:11.410] - Speaker 1
So far, what we've listened to has a much bigger rock sound then your previous material. Was that intentional?

[00:44:19.880] - Speaker 2
This song in particular, I wanted it to be rock song because I wanted to scream. I was so. It was built up frustration about being forced on the tour so much and missing home so much and feeling like I wasn't heard at times. And obviously, like, playing rock songs live is so much fun. So I feel like it comes hand in hand with the subject of tour and feeling frustrated.

[00:44:46.140] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like the energy of the music usually reflects what the lyrics are saying?

[00:44:53.130] - Speaker 2
Not simply, not always.

[00:44:54.670] - Speaker 1
Don't have to. It doesn't matter.

[00:44:56.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it doesn't matter. It depends how I feel at the time. Yeah.

[00:45:00.360] - Speaker 1
The music you're making is guitar based music in a world where guitar based music is not the main music anymore. And are you aware that you're doing something new, old?

[00:45:15.300] - Speaker 2
That's. Yeah, I guess so. In some ways, I think it's pretty cool. I love all music and I think the music now, I'm always gonna listen to electronic. Like, I go out and dance to techno and I would never listen to techno on the bus, but I think it's. I don't know. To me, it always feels timeless playing guitar, like, guitar music and the bands I listen to, the bands I grew up listening to.

[00:45:44.340] - Speaker 1
What did you listen to growing up?

[00:45:47.840] - Speaker 2
I had a lot of phrases, really, but my mom played a lot of the Cardigans and the Sundaes, the cranberries. And then when I met my girlfriend in school, it was a lot of the Smiths, the cure, stone roses, like.

[00:46:04.440] - Speaker 1
And these were bands that were from way before your time. But that was what everybody was listening to in your school?

[00:46:11.820] - Speaker 2
Well, my group of friends. That's interesting. Yeah, well, we also listened to, like, when I was 13. I loved one direction. Like, don't get me wrong, like, loved them. But then my friend Tara, she'd always like, come to school and be like, I can't believe you listen to that bullshit. And I'm like. And she was just this, like, 1413 year old girl that would always be like, I hate. I hate it. I'm like, no, you don't understand, Zayn Malik. And then she showed me the Smiths when I was 14, like, properly. And I was like, oh, I get it now. This is cool. And then I listened to loads of green day. And then when I started making music, I was listening to a lot of sonic youth. Sonic youth and pavement, listening to a lot of deaf tones. And at the moment when I was writing this record, I was, you know, I've gone back to listening to the Beatles and Fiona Apple and Nora Jones and Elliott Smith, Amy Winehouse, like, pine Grove list goes on. I listen to a lot of music, but, yeah.

[00:47:13.150] - Speaker 1
Would you say you're influenced by the things you listen to or not so much?

[00:47:16.670] - Speaker 2
Oh, influenced hard, yeah. Sometimes they, like, come to the studio with a song. I'm like, this song, we're doing this song. And, like, obviously, like, inevitably, like, I'm gonna hear me through it.

[00:47:27.810] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:47:28.090] - Speaker 2
Like, I'm all like, I'm always gonna shine through the inspirations I take because I never, like, it's so boring. Just, you know, just taking.

[00:47:37.840] - Speaker 1
You're not imitating anybody.

[00:47:39.340] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[00:47:39.870] - Speaker 1
You're always doing.

[00:47:41.000] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[00:47:41.700] - Speaker 1
You're doing your stuff in another style or in a different. In a different genre.

[00:47:46.460] - Speaker 2
And, like, admittedly, at one point, I think there was a time where I wanted to be exactly like the smashing pumpkins. And I tried doing that and failed and realized maybe, you know, I should just trust my gut. Cool. Yeah.

[00:48:03.440] - Speaker 1
Let's listen to the next song.

[00:48:05.060] - Speaker 2
Awesome. Oh, I love this one. One time didn't believe the.

[00:48:11.790] - Speaker 3
Love you, Gail. It takes two people to make that mistake. You never try high. You never try. It's such a shame you don't cross my mind but you did this one time? You did this one time? Wandering through the cheapest scapes? Just avoiding all the things that I say? Could never admit I wasn't sure? Always fighting the feeling you were such a boy so I got high and I got high? It's such a shame you didn't put up a fight? But you did this one time? You did this one time? It's such a shame you don't cross my mind but you did this one time?

[00:50:34.860] - Speaker 3
It's broken we're shameless and we never try to solve? Keep on faking just to make it what's the point of fiction? Problems when it's broken? We're shameless and we never try to solve? Keep on faking we step right on.

[00:51:10.310] - Speaker 2
So funny. Like, at the end, every time I hear that back, you can hear me and Sophie screaming, the bridge. And we were in the library, but it was me and Sophie, like, keep on faking. It was one of the funnest memories I have from this place. But, yeah, it's just, you know, your good old breakup song. I like, I've always. Cause, you know, throughout my music, I've been in relationships the whole time, and everyone's been like, we've never gotten a bb doobie breakup song. We've gotten, like, angry rock songs, but we want an angry breakup song. And I'm like, yeah, I've never. Like, I released the way things go, and that's, like, a sad, happy one, but, yeah, I thought it was time to write a proper banger, and it's.

[00:51:55.690] - Speaker 1
One that sticks in my head a lot. Like, when I think of the record, when I think of the record, this one is the one that. It's an earworm, you know?

[00:52:05.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I remember because there was that bass note, and it was like, we need to change that one bass note, and we always. So confused. Like, it's like, what is this bass note? Like, how much difference will it make? And we changed that one note, and it made the crazy. It was like, it just made everything make sense that different, so. Yeah, thanks. But I love that song. It's just. I love, like, the organs. I know that it's a rock song, but I love, like, the element of.

[00:52:33.900] - Speaker 1
You know, it's got a real psychedelic vibe.

[00:52:36.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:52:36.820] - Speaker 1
And I love the outro, like, the whole bridge and ending.

[00:52:40.700] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.

[00:52:41.350] - Speaker 1
Cool.

[00:52:42.420] - Speaker 2
That bit always reminded me of Annie, you know, like, it sounds like. It sounds like hard knock life or, like, just, like, kids, like, screaming. I think I just wanted something, like, just to recreate, like, absolute female rage, but. Yeah.

[00:52:57.770] - Speaker 1
Cool. What's next?

[00:53:02.510] - Speaker 2
Real Matt? One of my favorites was one of my favorites.

[00:53:13.340] - Speaker 3
Why don't you just call another simple lover I go for no weather I told my mother what it did.

[00:53:38.230] - Speaker 2
Like.

[00:53:38.760] - Speaker 3
A kid and I already told you I just wanted to dance. Cause you see me standing out here with my outstretched hand I guess no one ever told you how to be a real mandeh working as the morning back in you said you'll be in a second. What? The background, what did you do? And I already told you I'm a part of it. Then please forgive me just be thinking it's a fleet in the master guess no one ever taught you how to be a real man won't you hold it down take it if I gave you a chance need to read your shirt maybe not a silly. If you wanna come get it I help you out would you hold it down and take it up and give you a chance.

[00:55:38.450] - Speaker 1
Tell me about writing it.

[00:55:42.730] - Speaker 2
I just wanted a female anthem, a girl anthem. And I think I was single for a little bit. And I experienced a lot of disappointing men. And essentially, it's a song of me. Basically, a song about me telling a load of men to just pull their weight up. I was also. The second. Was the second chorus. There's a lyric where I say, and I already told you I'm not part of the band. Please. Yeah. Please forgive me just for thinking it's a fleeting romance. And for ages in my career and just being women in the industry, like a woman in general, I'm, like, carrying a guitar, for example, putting it in the back of an Uber. And the uber driver is always, like, always assumed I am never the lead singer or the good to Horace or I'm probably someone else or, you know, it's strange. It's just strange in this position. And I just wanted to kind of include that in a funny little way in this song.

[00:56:58.890] - Speaker 1
The recording has, like, a 1920s vibe.

[00:57:01.590] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[00:57:02.130] - Speaker 1
When you wrote it, did it have that?

[00:57:04.010] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. It was. It's like, honestly, just based off three chords. And I was listening to this unreleased Lana song called Waimea. And it has that sort of, like.

[00:57:16.360] - Speaker 1
Do you want to show me on the guitar? Do you remember how you wrote it?

[00:57:19.740] - Speaker 2
I think it's on. Is it on dadfed, or is it on?

[00:57:23.160] - Speaker 1
I just mean the feel of your song, not the Lana song.

[00:57:25.810] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:28.760] - Speaker 1
What was the feel you were playing when you were out?

[00:57:31.020] - Speaker 2
It's just. And then I wanted, like, widen the wedding for second. And then the melody of the bridge. I want it to be super, like, sexy and, like, almost playful. And it's crazy, like, what three chords can do. Like, you can write any melody on it, and it's like, wouldn't you hold.

[00:58:03.320] - Speaker 3
It down and take it if I gave you a chance? Neither Asians, baby, not a silly romance.

[00:58:09.880] - Speaker 2
So.

[00:58:10.930] - Speaker 1
So the chords stay the same even though the melody changes and it feels like a whole new part.

[00:58:14.850] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. And then obviously, you know, there's lots. There's lots of instrumentation in the song. But I think that alone is already quite playful. And you can do anything you want with those three chords. I mean, coffee, Washington, coffee is. It's just that it's very similar to six pence on the rich I kiss me but what can you do?

[00:58:42.490] - Speaker 1
That's okay.

[00:58:43.350] - Speaker 2
That is okay.

[00:58:45.130] - Speaker 1
What do we have next?

[00:58:46.430] - Speaker 2
Oh, tie my shoes. Sad one. A really sad one.

[00:59:08.640] - Speaker 3
Think. Been lying to myself wondering how it could have been struggling to keep it in or she eyed to eye with something cause I can't keep chasing it and now it's only just a kid waiting for you to turn my shoes it's all gon loose and

[01:00:24.750] - Speaker 3
I always wondered how you felt keeping all the secretion find it hard to raise and live lie to a girl who haunted the thought the world is you trying to trust in something new still waiting on you to die my shoes it's all gone loose and it spills.

[01:01:42.590] - Speaker 1
Such a good vibe.

[01:01:44.270] - Speaker 2
Melody is so lovely.

[01:01:45.780] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:01:47.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I love that song.

[01:01:51.470] - Speaker 1
What do you remember about it?

[01:01:53.630] - Speaker 2
I remember recording it here and playing it with Abe, who's just the most amazing drummer. And we recorded it live. And I remember just like us, like, staring each other just. And we were playing it. No, we were on click. But we were just really concentrating on the groove and just playing it loads and loads and loads of times. Just like, lock, lock in.

[01:02:16.130] - Speaker 1
It's got a really hypnotic vibe. That must be why.

[01:02:18.690] - Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. We literally did it over and over again. I love that song. I love the instrumentation. I love the sax. I love how rich it is. And I remember writing the chord progression after I'd written a song that I didn't like, and I was at home and I played it to my boyfriend. He was like, you can write a better one. And I was like. Because the song that I originally wrote was just like, I've got two cats and I live in the house. And I was like, the chords are lovely, but you should write something, you know, maybe a bit more meaningful. And I wrote this one. And the lyrics, I think, is probably. The lyrics on this song are probably the most heartbreaking lyrics on the record. I feel like this encapsulates the reason why. The way, like, the reason why I am the way I am, basically.

[01:03:07.890] - Speaker 1
It's a beauty. It's a beautiful song. And the guitar riff answer is so catchy and beautiful. Jacob. Really?

[01:03:17.320] - Speaker 2
Yeah, right? With the piano.

[01:03:19.580] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:03:20.730] - Speaker 2
I love that one.

[01:03:22.180] - Speaker 1
Typically, the lyrics come fast when you're working on a song.

[01:03:26.550] - Speaker 2
It depends. It depends. You know, I think I got really into everything I was feeling at that moment when I wrote this song. And it was after I'd written, you know, the breakup song and, like, take a bite. And it was thinking I was digging deeper to why I act the way I act. And it always stems from what you see when you're a child. And this song essentially is just me saying, I never want to put my hopes up for something because I'm scared I'm just gonna get disappointed constantly.

[01:04:13.570] - Speaker 1
You still feel that way?

[01:04:15.650] - Speaker 2
Not so much. Not so much anymore. Which is great.

[01:04:19.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:04:20.140] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I think, honestly, writing music and this song especially, definitely helped you think, by.

[01:04:28.770] - Speaker 1
Putting it out into the world, it somehow has some healing effect, I guess.

[01:04:33.910] - Speaker 2
So, in some ways, you know, like a message from someone who says they've listened to the song and saying that they relate to it makes me feel like I'm almost less alone or. I saw Sabrina Carpenter the other day, and we were talking about music, and I talked about a song that I really liked because I really related to it. And I never really heard a musician sing about, you know, that, like, those sort of situations. And I don't really listen to, you know, that genre of music, but I really connect to that song, and I really respect her as an artist. And she named a song off my last record that she said she loved, and I was like, that's so funny, because I'm singing about the exact same subject as you were.

[01:05:18.200] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:05:18.790] - Speaker 2
And it was. And we connected through that, and I felt way less alone. I felt so much better.

[01:05:24.700] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:05:25.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:05:25.970] - Speaker 1
That's great. What do we have next?

[01:05:28.980] - Speaker 2
Girl song?

[01:05:56.670] - Speaker 3
Just a girl who overthinks about proportions or her waist. The creases on her face, they like no other and just another bad day all I wanna do is find the words to make it up to you making all the same mistakes I guess there's still a lot to prove and there's something I can't say an ordinary way day like no other and just another bad day waking up to hardly recognize in my own face just a stranger in the mirror thinking oh, what a shame didn't think she'd like this way don't look no different to how I lived yesterday all I wanna do is find the words and make it all to you making all the same I guess there's still a lot to prove and there's something I can say in an ordinary way date like no other I'm just another bad day.

[01:08:29.120] - Speaker 1
My.

[01:08:29.490] - Speaker 3
Brain'S no good at fighting my hands are tight and I'm out loose and I'm no good at lying I'm better at denying the consequence that sounds dama need a helping hand day like no other and just another bad day.

[01:09:19.700] - Speaker 1
That sounds like a song that could have been written 50 years ago and could be written in 50 years. It's outside of time.

[01:09:27.180] - Speaker 2
Thank you. That means so much. Yeah, I love that one. And to think it was born out of a bad spot on my face. Is that what it was? Yeah, a really bad spot.

[01:09:40.620] - Speaker 1
And did you write it on guitar?

[01:09:42.260] - Speaker 2
I wrote on guitar originally, and I remember always wanting it to be on piano. And I wrote the bridge on, like, the third day at Shangri La. And that is one of my most favorite bridges I ever wrote. And I can't for the life of me remember the actual chords on guitar, but I remember writing it and then going straight to the studio, and I think Benny was there, and I was like, these are the chords. And then showing it to him and he's playing it on piano. And then when we recorded it, it was just. There's no comps. It's just one take. And it was me and Benny in that room. Yeah, it was a really lovely experience. It was very healing. I was like, God, that spot really didn't matter because this song is great. Right?

[01:10:26.830] - Speaker 1
You can really hear the intimacy between the piano and the vocal. Like they're really connected.

[01:10:32.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, no, 100%. I mean, Benny is an amazing pianist.

[01:10:36.680] - Speaker 1
Cool. What do we have next?

[01:10:38.220] - Speaker 3
Coming home, you do the dishes I'll carry the law to make up lost time the trash to the brim and I'm scared of it but you always know just what to say and I'm sorry if I'm coming home too late I'm waking up to the gap all my blind speaking sunlight I do anything just to be with you to sit and watch you slowly wake and I'm sorry if I'm coming home too late a hotel room only means I'll be and an american stay makes me feel so far away so I promise this time I won't be late and a bar on the roof's not a good way to leave you too sit on a plane only shows that were miles away so I promise this time I won't be late I'll do the dishes we'll carry them on because we have time I emptied the trash like I said I would and it never guess what I'd have to say sorry cause this time I won't be late so cool.

[01:12:50.850] - Speaker 1
What was the occasion that brought that song to us?

[01:12:55.010] - Speaker 2
I was in LA, and I was away from my boyfriend and home, and I missed him so much. And what's funny is that there's a lyric in that song where I'm like, and the bar on the roof's not a good way to leave you two. And that was so specific at the time because it was, like, our first argument in LA, and it was on a bar on the roof of our hotel. And obviously, I don't think he's dated a musician before, so when he played in the song, he was like, oh, whoa. And I'm like, I'm sorry, but it's so sweet. It's like.

[01:13:27.690] - Speaker 1
It really is. It's an apology song that is having so much fun that it. There's no way you can be mad after that. Like, it takes all of the sting out of the story.

[01:13:41.670] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:13:42.290] - Speaker 1
It's so much fun.

[01:13:43.320] - Speaker 2
And at the end, it's like, well, at the end of the day, I'm not gonna be late. I don't need to promise you anymore because I won't be late. And I think it was, you know, I wrote it around the same time I wrote California about tour. And it was after I finally managed to be, like, three weeks max. This is what I want. I know what I want. And so at the end of coming home, I'm like, finally, I can do what I want now. And I understand, you know, my situation, and I can now stand up for myself. Great. Which is great. So I love that song. If I was better at ballet, I would dance to the song.

[01:14:20.320] - Speaker 1
That could be a really good video, though.

[01:14:22.000] - Speaker 2
I know, right? But I'm not there yet. I'm really not there.

[01:14:25.400] - Speaker 1
Something to practice.

[01:14:26.550] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:14:28.080] - Speaker 1
Although I think even, like, not being good at it could be really cool, too.

[01:14:31.740] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And, like, doing it my own way.

[01:14:33.940] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:14:34.480] - Speaker 2
There's so many rules in ballet. Like, you're doing everything wrong at one.

[01:14:38.070] - Speaker 1
Point so you can start doing it the right way and then be frustrated and then make your own way and rebel.

[01:14:46.290] - Speaker 2
My pallete would not be happy about that. I can try and convince it.

[01:14:51.520] - Speaker 1
I could see kids in ballet class all over rebelling and changing the rules of ballet. That'd be fantastic.

[01:14:57.590] - Speaker 2
That would be awesome.

[01:14:58.750] - Speaker 1
When did you start keeping a journal?

[01:15:01.750] - Speaker 2
Since I. Oh, God, since I can remember. Really? Like eight years old.

[01:15:09.170] - Speaker 1
How'd you get the idea to start?

[01:15:13.110] - Speaker 2
I don't know. I've probably seen it in the movies. And I was like, oh, my God, I really loved English. I loved writing. So an excuse to write at one point in my life, which is crazy to think about. I used to, like, find random topics and I'd write essays about it just for fun.

[01:15:30.810] - Speaker 1
That's cool.

[01:15:32.000] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:15:32.660] - Speaker 1
It makes you a better writer.

[01:15:33.790] - Speaker 2
I guess so. But, like, I find, like, with the way I speak and, like, sometimes, like, the way I communicate, my words are all jumbled up sometimes. And especially, like, in some of my songs, like, sometimes it doesn't really make sense, but it makes sense to me. And when I wrote these, like, essays and when, like, I was never really good at English, despite me loving English so much and these essays weren't necessarily good. I just liked. I writing. I just liked words.

[01:15:58.470] - Speaker 1
Are you always writing songs?

[01:16:00.640] - Speaker 2
Not so much. I think I'm getting busier now, so I can't really. But I try write. I try write every day despite it being really hard. And it's. And most the songs are trashed, but I think it's just getting in the habit.

[01:16:16.880] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:16:17.540] - Speaker 2
Always playing. Yeah.

[01:16:19.550] - Speaker 1
I think it's good also, because you never know when. You never know when a good one's gonna come.

[01:16:24.430] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:16:24.970] - Speaker 1
And they don't come on demand.

[01:16:26.400] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:16:27.050] - Speaker 1
So getting the not so good ones out of the way is useful.

[01:16:31.330] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And also, like, you can revisit it and make it better because a lot of. Some of the songs on this record came from ideas I had recorded on voice notes on my phone. And I was like, I like the vibe of this, or I like this one chord. Like, I'm gonna try recreate that and then it can become something completely different and something. Something new.

[01:16:49.480] - Speaker 1
So would a voice note typically be just singing into the voice note, or might you be playing and singing?

[01:16:55.910] - Speaker 2
It'd be playing and singing, yeah. But then, for example, take a bite. Take a bite. No, I didn't even record that on voice notes. I went to the studio straight away. I just went and saw Jacob the next day because I couldn't do that because it was singing over a demo. But it's always guitar. And.

[01:17:15.520] - Speaker 1
Do you feel like you can maintain your privacy now in your new life?

[01:17:21.720] - Speaker 2
Yeah, in a lot of ways, obviously. Like, the thing is with me is, like, I love sharing, and I'm like, athena, like a 23 year old girl on the Internet, and, like, I will post pictures of my cats. Like, I will post the animal I'm with. I will post my boyfriend. Like, that's just who I am. I'm never going to change that. But, you know, I'm not gonna tell the Internet and, like, everyone my entire life.

[01:17:47.320] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:17:47.700] - Speaker 2
I mean, apart from the music. But I think I do what I get to choose. Exactly. I get to choose, and I do what I'm most comfortable, you know?

[01:17:59.200] - Speaker 1
Who are some of your current favorite artists?

[01:18:01.260] - Speaker 2
My current favorite artists? Hmm. Like, musicians now, like, who would you.

[01:18:10.240] - Speaker 1
Be excited to go to see?

[01:18:12.290] - Speaker 2
Oh, I'm always excited to see town style gig, I could tell you that. And they were here when I was. Yeah, when I was recording.

[01:18:19.050] - Speaker 1
What is it about them that you like?

[01:18:21.210] - Speaker 2
I just love their live performances. I think the lead singer has, like, such a way of performing. Like, he almost dances like a ballerina. And since doing ballet, I appreciate it so much more. I'm like, it's super hard to do that spin and, like, how the hell does he do that while singing perfectly and screaming? Like, it's shit is crazy. And the band are incredible, so I love them. I love Chapel Rowan. I think she's awesome. I definitely go see her play live.

[01:18:55.480] - Speaker 1
I just saw a video of her that hers. That was great. Just a little clip, and it was.

[01:18:59.090] - Speaker 2
Like, her life is like. Like, her live shows are just so much energy and really good.

[01:19:04.680] - Speaker 1
And have you seen her live or not yet?

[01:19:06.620] - Speaker 2
No, not yet. But I've spoken to her briefly online. There's this one song that. Her new song that she released, I can kiss a hundred poison bars. It sounds like Kate Bush. Like, I haven't heard a song like that in ages. Like, oh, my God, it's awesome. She's cool.

[01:19:25.080] - Speaker 1
Maybe you guys will get to tour together at some point.

[01:19:27.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I hope so. That'd be good.

[01:19:28.180] - Speaker 1
That'd be a good one.

[01:19:29.290] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:19:29.910] - Speaker 1
Um, what do we have next?

[01:19:31.840] - Speaker 2
Ever seen?

[01:19:47.700] - Speaker 3
Spend some time waiting for your face don't wanna risk just making all the same mistakes the highest I think, I swear it's just to calm down and make me do it and I show it wasting all my time just throwing it spend some time with your face don't wanna risk just taking all the same.

[01:20:39.600] - Speaker 2
God.

[01:20:40.140] - Speaker 3
Open. Said I had the prettiest I eat ever seen I've been through this too many times and I noticed but I felt before I stepped back I've been nervous cause I spent some time when God the prettiest I did when I'm with you and want to get too high and I can't breathe I can't lie the other criticize I ever seen pretty size I.

[01:22:55.100] - Speaker 1
Who'S it about?

[01:22:56.660] - Speaker 2
Jake.

[01:22:57.600] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:22:59.420] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. I love that song. It's so, like, euphoric. We're actually filming the music video in a couple weeks.

[01:23:06.010] - Speaker 1
Great.

[01:23:06.300] - Speaker 2
Because it's a single. That one.

[01:23:07.720] - Speaker 1
Oh, cool.

[01:23:08.080] - Speaker 2
So it'll be out when this is out, but I'm doing it in Tokyo.

[01:23:11.420] - Speaker 1
Cool.

[01:23:11.990] - Speaker 2
Mm hmm.

[01:23:12.650] - Speaker 1
How many times have you gone to Tokyo?

[01:23:14.780] - Speaker 2
Only once. Really? It was so sick.

[01:23:19.010] - Speaker 1
What's the concept of the video?

[01:23:22.310] - Speaker 2
Just me being in love. Really? Because the song is so euphoric and it's a base. The song is about taking too much ecstasy in Glastonbury festival and coming up and having the worst come down ever. But, like, at the end of the day, appreciating. Oh, my God, I'm in love with you. And I should just, like, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up about all those stupid things and just focus on how beautiful your eyes are. Do you know what I mean? But, yeah, it's a sweet love song, I think. And I think the whole music video is based on, like, me and my boyfriend did a music video for the song glue song, and we filmed it in my home country, Iloilo. And the camera almost acted like, his eyes, like, I was kind of looking at him.

[01:24:10.940] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:24:11.690] - Speaker 2
And it's always different, like, working with your partner, especially, like, working with Jake, because we have such, like, a lovely relationship every time we work together. It's. Especially when I'm singing about love and I'm singing about him. There is, like, a connection I can't really get with any other song or any other person. When he films me.

[01:24:35.250] - Speaker 1
It'S almost like the videos can be an extension of your relationship.

[01:24:38.430] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:24:38.930] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:24:40.030] - Speaker 2
It's fun. It's real, you know, it's not.

[01:24:42.250] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's not a performance.

[01:24:45.160] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:24:45.630] - Speaker 1
You're in it.

[01:24:46.730] - Speaker 2
I just. I love making things with people I love. And I think Jake is talented. Like, genuinely, if we weren't even together, like, he would be making my music videos.

[01:24:58.000] - Speaker 1
Great.

[01:24:58.840] - Speaker 2
We see him over there, but yeah, he's cool.

[01:25:02.720] - Speaker 1
What's next?

[01:25:04.180] - Speaker 2
Cruel affair I remember ra dancing to this song.

[01:25:27.750] - Speaker 3
As she wakes they all say with wide eyed gaze and amaze how can something so uncomplicated still fill her brain sweet a smile with her eyes perfect style she doesn't try why so many a song could depend and waste in time and I know somewhere we both care cause she's contemplating on both side complaining but we compare

[01:26:52.670] - Speaker 3
something wonder it's unfair oh, it's exaggerated we both elaborated occurring the fair.

[01:27:26.680] - Speaker 2
It'S funny because I spent that whole week. I remember when I was writing the song because actually Jacob wrote the chords and I was in the studio and I was trying to come up with the lyrics, and I was like, that past week, I'd been comparing myself so much girls on the Internet and absolutely hating the way I look. Stupid. Very stupid. But I wrote that, like, almost in, like, I wanted to put, like, a fun twist on it. And that's why in the end, I'm like, she's a catch, but so am I. Like, we both, like, everyone has the same problems. Like, it's not like I looked any different yesterday. I just feel different. I just feel a little bit shitter today. But that doesn't mean I'm any uglier. Like, and that girl I see on the Internet, in my opinion, is the most perfect human being I've ever seen probably feels the exact same feelings I do. So, yeah, I decided to write a song about that.

[01:28:24.820] - Speaker 1
Do you ever talk about it with your girlfriends?

[01:28:26.650] - Speaker 2
Oh, all the time.

[01:28:28.060] - Speaker 1
Tell me the conversation.

[01:28:30.040] - Speaker 2
Um, Sophie. Well, this song in straight in mind is Sophie because we're just, like, super toxic together. It's really bad. Um, and like, a lot of my other girlfriends, like, from school, but my other girlfriends, they're just. They're so sure of themselves, and I look at them and I'm like, wow. Like, you really just don't give a fuck. Like, I love that. But I think when you're just on your phone and so online, like, there's an inevitability of just, like, seeing a lot of beautiful women or, like, society tells you this, like, ideal version of what you should be. And that is not true.

[01:29:05.690] - Speaker 1
The filtered version?

[01:29:06.830] - Speaker 2
Yeah, 100%. The filtered, posed, like version ring light version. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's ridiculous. And we'd, like, sit there and talk about it for ages and be like, oh, I just want to like this. Like, I want to dye my hair, blah, blah, blah. And at the end of it, just like, that compensation just, like, didn't help with anything. Like, we just sat and complained and it's gotten way better. I feel like this was, you know, before a lot of things had happened in our lives, so we were just still, like, fret. Like, we still felt very young. I feel like a lot of things had happened in the past year that made us grow up like that.

[01:29:41.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Do you ever not look?

[01:29:46.380] - Speaker 2
Oh, recently, I definitely haven't cared. I think it was. I think it's because I'm busy and I'm too busy thinking about a lot of other things right now, about this album, about releasing this album. It's because after sharing a lot, I had a lot of time off. I had Christmas, and then they went holiday and, like, just chilling at home. I went out a lot. I went out partying and, yeah, drank too much, got really sad a lot of the times, compared myself to a lot of people, and, yeah, I just felt sorry for myself. And I was like, what am I doing? I just made one of my favorite things ever. Who was the coolest dude ever? And why am I sat here crying over some stranger? Are you joking? And I realized it was so stupid. And then I was like, I've got the perfect song for this. What was crazy is that. And on my way to all my lessons, ballet, whatever. And I could listen to anything on Spotify, but there's always a song for the mood I'm in. And this was after we made the record. So I had this link and I was like, there were so many times I need to listen to cruel affair because I need to laugh about this situation.

[01:30:59.800] - Speaker 2
Or, like, I want to listen to beaches because I miss Shangri la so much. And, like, there was always a song for something, which is why I love this one.

[01:31:08.790] - Speaker 1
That's beautiful that your own songs can be therapy for you even after the fact.

[01:31:12.740] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah, just listen. It's like I need reminding, especially with, like, take goodbye. Like, every time, like, me and Jake get a thing where I'm like, oh, my God, I feel like I'm spiraling again. And we listen to take, goodbye, and we're like, oh, there you go. That's why I'm smiling. I'm like, I should acknowledge why I'm being annoying.

[01:31:34.130] - Speaker 1
What's next?

[01:31:35.810] - Speaker 2
Um, post.

[01:31:43.490] - Speaker 3
Said he's getting tired run the fast life worth living the hardest again guess sometimes you anticipate forgetting all I want at the most just to see your name on the coast he said, he said something about her is hard to regret every time she looks in and breaking the sword you know I wanted the most just to see her mom on the pose Jesus, Jesus Jesus Jesus

[01:33:37.220] - Speaker 3
he said, he said, he said, he said.

[01:34:12.590] - Speaker 1
Do you still write letters?

[01:34:14.590] - Speaker 2
Hmm. No, but I used to a lot. I used to get those letters written to me. But that song is interesting because it was like a mashup of all the experiences I had from my friends and the experiences I had about breakups. So I wanted to kind of, like, encapsulate all of everything that I've learned, everything I've heard into this one song. So there's not like a. Like, it's not a storyline. I've, you know, necessarily experienced word for word, which is quite different with, you know, my other music, which is cool. And then sonically, like, what I love about this song is I remember writing it. I found a tuning that I really liked. I was just, like, fiddling with the little tuning heads. I can't even remember. It's written down somewhere. And then it literally consists of two fingers just going up and down the neck, which I think is cool because it's just the simplest thing ever.

[01:35:10.850] - Speaker 1
In those moments when you're messing around on the guitar, do you know it's a song when a melody comes? Or might you just like the music?

[01:35:21.900] - Speaker 2
It's interesting you say that, because I went to the studio with just the chords, because I just really liked the chords. They were so open. And sometimes it starts off like that, and sometimes it takes me a while to finish that song. It took me a while. It took me a bit to finish that song.

[01:35:36.100] - Speaker 1
But you liked the chords. You just didn't know yet what the vocals were going to do.

[01:35:39.370] - Speaker 2
It wasn't really like I knew the melody. It was more the lyrics and. But I love the openness of, like, open tuning so much that you can. You can sing any melody and it will work.

[01:35:52.550] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[01:35:53.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:35:53.940] - Speaker 1
What are your reading habits like?

[01:35:56.180] - Speaker 2
Well, I read a lot about cats. My favorite book is if all cats disappeared from the world. And it's translated from Japanese. I forgot who wrote it. But it's an amazing book about a man who has cancer, and he gets visited by the devil, and he's like, if you want to live, you have to get rid of something in the world. And he gets rid of phones. He gets rid of everything. And then it comes down to cats, and he's like, wow, if all cats disappeared from the world, it makes such a difference. But if I, one single person has no family disappear from the world, then it would make no difference, and then just makes you. The book almost made me appreciate a lot in life and, like, not only just cats, but everything and how important the simplest things are. But, yeah, that's honestly, like, my favorite book. And the other book I've read is another book about cats. Yeah.

[01:36:54.560] - Speaker 1
When did you get your cat tattoo?

[01:36:56.980] - Speaker 2
Before I actually owned cats, I got this tattoo.

[01:37:00.350] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:37:00.780] - Speaker 2
I got it on tour. I don't know why I like cats so much.

[01:37:04.930] - Speaker 1
So you have. Has it always been.

[01:37:07.480] - Speaker 2
I love cat. Well, I loved red pandas a lot. I had, like, a red panda Instagram account where I, like, I'd edit my face on, like, red pandas and, like, I'd like, post pictures of red pandas and, like, post red panda facts. And then. And I still love red pandas. It's just like, cats were always such, like, I was never really allowed pets growing up because I lived in a council estate and they didn't really let you have dogs or cats. And so as soon as I. It was actually as soon as I got back from the Taylor tour, the Taylor Swift tour, Jake surprised me with a little ginger cat, and they called him kimchi. And I was like, he can't be alone. We need to get his sister. So the next day, I got his sister and called her miso, and the rest is history.

[01:37:54.650] - Speaker 1
Do they sleep in bed with you guys?

[01:37:56.040] - Speaker 2
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We think about this all the time. We're like, you know, when do we have kids? Like, where are the cats going? He's like, oh, where's the cats going to sleep? I'm like, on the bed. Like, still, like, everybody will be in bed with us.

[01:38:08.820] - Speaker 1
Yeah, family bed.

[01:38:09.740] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Like, and we've got such a big bed as well. Like, imagine like, a baby. Three cats at that point. Hopefully four. I would have more. And a dog all on bed. Perfect.

[01:38:21.350] - Speaker 1
What do we have left?

[01:38:23.270] - Speaker 2
We've got four more.

[01:38:24.590] - Speaker 1
Great.

[01:38:25.550] - Speaker 2
This next one is about this place. Just sweet.

[01:38:47.840] - Speaker 3
Find the reasons for the constant change of the actual truth. Cause I'm sure now I'm sure cause there is another one when I'm off the bright beaches I tell me all I see is don't wait for that just both your feet I'm sure find a heart say I know that I'm alright take a while for me to finally realize I want to see it? I believe it give me peace of mind I'm sure now I'm sure that day by the one when I shake all the way over time just now I'm sure now I'm sure Sadeena I'm afraid fall down but I understand the cold now come pick it up the flight while it can't help it can't help us days when I want when I want the right beaches I want anyone tell me all the sea don't wait for me I'm sure.

[01:42:12.280] - Speaker 2
That'S my favorite. So cool.

[01:42:16.280] - Speaker 1
Tell me the story.

[01:42:18.440] - Speaker 2
Well, I actually was the one song I didn't write at home, so it was the last song I wrote for this record. And it was literally, like, a week before we had to leave. And I was like, we have to somehow squeeze this into the album. And they wrote it about being nervous about doing this, like, doing this whole, like, experience and going all the way to Malibu to record this album. Because I had never made a record out of London before. It was always in, like, the comfort of the city I lived in and with the people I would always hang out with. So this was a new world for me. And I was basically shitting myself. And I got here and I realized, wow, I would be. I would have been stupid if I didn't go fully in. And there's a lyric, like, one of my favorite lyrics on the whole record is don't wait for the tide. Just to dip both your feet in. And I think it just encapsulates, like, if you get an opportunity like this, don't do it half assed. Put your all into it.

[01:43:25.090] - Speaker 1
It has a California sound, too. Something about it. Maybe the harmonies, I'm not sure.

[01:43:30.200] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I think. I haven't written a rock song in a while on standard tuning. And I feel like. Because I always tune my guitars in a different way. And, like, with this song, it felt. It just feels so natural to play and almost, like, effortless. And it's by far my favorite song off the album. And when I listen to it, it literally transports me back here.

[01:43:56.580] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[01:43:57.860] - Speaker 2
Yeah. I love it so much.

[01:44:00.010] - Speaker 1
What else? What's next?

[01:44:01.850] - Speaker 2
Everything I want great.

[01:44:23.580] - Speaker 3
Yet everything I want falling on at every season you're everything I want I'm everything you are now I see the weather's got me down like the sun you'll come around I have finally figured out you are just around the corner oh, such a predicament trying to do it breath at this time out of all the silly feelings people can say whatever they want. Cause you're everything I want? And I don't need another? Now I see the weather's got me down like the sun? You'll come around? I have finally figured out? You are just around the corner? As the light shone on my face like a sun I almost taste and has stayed with me for days? And I hope it lasts forever. You're such a princess.

[01:47:05.280] - Speaker 1
I love how effortless the vocal sounds.

[01:47:07.390] - Speaker 2
Right?

[01:47:08.150] - Speaker 1
Easy.

[01:47:09.290] - Speaker 2
I think out of all the songs on the album, I think that's where I like my vocals the best.

[01:47:15.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's just such a. Feels effortless.

[01:47:18.600] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Thank you.

[01:47:19.530] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[01:47:20.530] - Speaker 2
That's one of, like. I think that's, like, one of my other favorites, that song, because it's just so. I love, like, the honky tonk piano. I think it's so playful and really sweet, and it matches, like, the meaning behind the song. It's just, like, I, like, I always gonna wear my heart on my sleeve, and I am just, like. I love being in love sort of person, so, yeah, I love it.

[01:47:44.410] - Speaker 1
Cool. What's next?

[01:47:46.180] - Speaker 2
The man who left you soon.

[01:48:05.580] - Speaker 3
In a state of finding comfort in familiar places that I know it's only temporary. It comes and it goes. Like the weather in the summer when the wind decides to move. I look up to the sky and think, at least we look at the same moon. At least we look at the same moon. The one of many ways I could think of you. The irony of looking up to something or even just somebody can put their face onto the name that I don't even know. The things of what you had ahead of dad that didn't know. We both looked at the sky and thought, at least we look at the same room. At least got the same mound. I wish I met the man who had left too soon.

[01:49:34.620] - Speaker 1
That's another one that feels like it could be a musical theater piece.

[01:49:38.100] - Speaker 2
So cool. Yeah. There's a lot of personality in the song, I think.

[01:49:41.870] - Speaker 1
Did it come from a real looking at the moon story?

[01:49:46.080] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:49:46.680] - Speaker 1
Tell me.

[01:49:47.200] - Speaker 2
I think it's. Hmm. I've.

[01:49:53.670] - Speaker 1
Why does it say at least?

[01:49:55.130] - Speaker 2
At least. I've never been through a lot of, like, family death. Like, I've never. Like, I had a couple of family members that died, but was very young, so my boyfriend's dad died a couple of years ago, and watching how that affects people was a very eye opening experience, and, like, it made me really grateful to have my parents. And I wrote this about his dad, and I was thinking about death and thinking about how you remember someone and I always thought, like, the moon is always. It comes back to the same place in the sky every night. And it's comforting knowing that somewhere out there, you're looking at the same moon. Whether it's like, even when I'm miles away from Tordeh on tour and my parents are back home, like, we're at least looking at the same moon. And it's the same concept. When you think about, you know, someone who's passed, like, at the end of the day, they're always around somehow. And he just sounded like an awesome guy. Like the coolest guy ever. And I wish I had met him. And what's funny with this song is that I played it to my boyfriend and he played it to his family.

[01:51:12.020] - Speaker 2
And I was like, you know, like, just like, are you guys comfortable with me singing about this? Whatever. And what I found so interesting was that his dad, before his part, before he passed, he painted moons. He painted the moon for Jake, his sister, his brother and his wife.

[01:51:33.930] - Speaker 1
Amazing. Did you know that when you wrote the song?

[01:51:36.160] - Speaker 2
No, I didn't.

[01:51:36.840] - Speaker 1
Wow.

[01:51:38.090] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:51:38.790] - Speaker 1
So cool.

[01:51:40.500] - Speaker 2
Yeah, he seemed like an awesome guy. All his. He was an amazing artist. And a lot of his paintings are hung up on that house.

[01:51:49.620] - Speaker 1
Beautiful. And what else do we have?

[01:51:53.280] - Speaker 2
This is the last one. This is how it went. So it's like the closing of the record.

[01:52:13.550] - Speaker 3
Scared to speak finding words for an email to you try to see through the herd to find it stuck on my shoe hanging on a piece of gum it's time to let it go we'll just move on and let me write a song like all the songs I love to listen to writing cause I'm healing never writing songs to hurt you using one I'm best at and I hope you do the same. A movie. Before planning on something to say I turned off the tv and I laid in my bed listening to Elliot Ranning songs he did the same about situations would have been just the same. You had to make it obvious. Oh, come on, man. Just let me write a song like all the songs I love to listen to writing. Cause I'm feeling never writing songs to hurt you using what I'm best at and I hope you do the same. Should we make a movie? Before planning on so fast and you messed up all by yourself and I sat right here secretly tried to help and I did my best and you never know but sure satisfaction's for you just a gloat and it was my song.

[01:54:43.290] - Speaker 3
Oh, just the song. You made it worse just by singing along. Just keep busy, I make a movie and I'll stick to writing my song no one's getting tired don't want to speak oh, please let me go to sleep getting tired don't want to speak oh, please let me go to sleep getting tired don't want to speak oh, please let me go to sleep getting tired don't want to speak oh, please let me go to sleep.

[01:55:29.510] - Speaker 1
Charming song.

[01:55:30.690] - Speaker 3
Thank you.

[01:55:31.540] - Speaker 1
I love it. How did that one come?

[01:55:35.590] - Speaker 2
Oh, it's very honest. I could say that I think, you know, it's the end of the album for a reason, because at the end of the day, with my music, everything I write about, as much as it helps writing these songs and how much it helps my brain, I'm writing it because it either deeply, deeply hurt me or it made me really, really happy. There's always a really strong emotion, and with this one, it was very deep sadness and a lot of confusion and a lot of just, like, life and inevitability. And just, like, this is what happens. This is what it takes to be a musician. I am going to write what I want to write about, and when I put it out in the world, then so be it. What happens? Like, it's not really my song anymore. And, you know, a lot of things had happened in the past year where I felt like I couldn't do that, and I felt like I was. I wasn't allowed to do what I loved to do and what I meant to be doing. And, yeah, it made me feel really strange. Like, I look at, I quote, elliot smells, say that I was sat in bed listening to Elliot writing songs.

[01:56:52.070] - Speaker 2
He did the same about situations. And it's like, all my favorite artists, they do that. Taylor Swift, every one of her songs about breakup songs. And I felt like I was. Yeah, like, it was a bad thing. I did that. And it was weird. And it was. It's strange because I put out my. This breakup song called the way things go, and it was almost out of my hands, and. And there was so much attention on the wrong side of it because someone put attention to it. Like, it was just a song. It was just a song for people to relate to, and it was, you.

[01:57:27.650] - Speaker 1
Know, and you were singing your truth. Yeah, that's all it was.

[01:57:33.050] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:57:34.290] - Speaker 1
There's no right or wrong. It's just. Yeah, this is my experience. It's awesome.

[01:57:38.440] - Speaker 2
And I think that there's a lyric in that song where it's like, just go make a movie, and I'll keep writing my songs. It's like, art is art, and like, you express yourself with art, and that's what I do with music. And, yeah, that song, every time I hear it, I posted this thing with my close friends. It's like listening to the bridge on this is how it went, which is the song name, is, like, self harm.

[01:58:07.020] - Speaker 1
It's like, the bridge is so good. It's maybe the best part of the song.

[01:58:11.130] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I love the bridge. It's so honest, but it's so triggering, and it's still. And it's something that I have to talk about in therapy a lot because I feel like I've spoken a lot of stuff that happened in my childhood. And you hear in the music on this album where I feel like I'm coming to terms with what happened and I'm understanding it and how it doesn't really affect my relationships anymore because I'm acknowledging. I'm either acknowledging it or finally accepting everything I've been through. And, you know, this situation that happened to me and how this song was born is something that I'm still trying to understand because I had blamed myself for years. And so it's something that I'm still trying to figure out.

[01:58:57.510] - Speaker 1
When you listen to it, does it feel scary or does it give you a sense of freedom?

[01:59:01.230] - Speaker 2
It gives me. It definitely gives me a sense of freedom. Scary, because it. Just. Because it's so specific and it says things like, something like, I remember that day. A lot of things had happened in that day. And as soon as I got back to my hotel room, I wrote this song. So it was word for word, everything I did and everything I felt in that exact moment. And it takes me, like, beaches. It takes me back to Shangri laden with this song. It takes me back to that hotel room.

[01:59:32.110] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but that's the power of getting to put it into a song. Instead of slitting your wrists.

[01:59:40.070] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:59:41.120] - Speaker 1
That's the beauty of it.

[01:59:42.760] - Speaker 2
Exactly.

[01:59:43.290] - Speaker 1
Instead of, like, you're getting it out.

[01:59:44.840] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Like, instead of feeling anger and feeling sadness towards a person or putting a blame onto someone, you're just expressing it through something positive and something.

[01:59:55.950] - Speaker 1
You're making something beautiful.

[01:59:57.400] - Speaker 2
Exactly. So there is, you know, that's the positive side of it. And that makes me happy. That's enough for it to make me happy.

[02:00:05.930] - Speaker 1
And it is your job.

[02:00:07.620] - Speaker 2
That's my job.

[02:00:08.400] - Speaker 1
It's exactly your job.

[02:00:09.360] - Speaker 2
It pays the bills against the cat.

[02:00:13.640] - Speaker 1
It probably saves your life.

[02:00:15.480] - Speaker 2
Exactly. It's my job. It's what people pay to. I also can't help doing it.

[02:00:21.680] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I feel like you would do it either. Way. Yeah, it seems that way.

[02:00:25.730] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[02:00:27.270] - Speaker 1
Thank you so much for talking to me. I love seeing you.

[02:00:29.410] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[02:00:29.950] - Speaker 1
Always fun.

[02:00:31.070] - Speaker 2
Yeah. It's always so nice.

[02:00:32.690] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[02:00:33.190] - Speaker 2
I need to come back here again and sleep there.

[02:00:36.640] - Speaker 1
Are you looking forward to playing the songs live?

[02:00:40.250] - Speaker 2
Oh, God, yeah.

[02:00:41.410] - Speaker 1
Do you have any gigs booked?

[02:00:42.810] - Speaker 2
I've got two nights at the Greek in LA.

[02:00:45.210] - Speaker 1
Wow. When's that?

[02:00:47.450] - Speaker 2
Sometime at the end. Like September to November.

[02:00:50.930] - Speaker 1
Amazing.

[02:00:51.830] - Speaker 2
I'm doing, like, UK and Europe as well.

[02:00:53.470] - Speaker 1
Have you ever been there? The Greek? Where have you played there?

[02:00:55.270] - Speaker 2
I played there once.

[02:00:56.140] - Speaker 1
It's great.

[02:00:56.790] - Speaker 2
It's awesome. My favorite show.

[02:00:58.240] - Speaker 1
It's a great place to see a show, too, like, for the audience. It's one of the best places.

[02:01:01.550] - Speaker 2
It's beautiful. You see everything and all the trees around.

[02:01:04.550] - Speaker 1
Very beautiful place.

[02:01:05.550] - Speaker 2
It's such a good venue. And I was like, you're, like, trying to get me to play it in another, like, another venue. I was like, it has to be. I'll play the Greek twice if I get to play the Greek again, but you should come. You should come.

[02:01:17.110] - Speaker 1
If I'm here, I will.

[02:01:17.680] - Speaker 2
It's like a whole, like, stage design thing, I think.

[02:01:20.920] - Speaker 1
Beautiful.

[02:01:21.830] - Speaker 2
It's cool. Like, everything is starting again. It's very scary. A lot of, like, I've been talking about the album so much and, like, playing the album to loads of people and it just. It's all feeling very real and it's quite scary.

[02:01:35.330] - Speaker 1
What's the most interesting thing someone has told you back when you played them? Something?

[02:01:43.200] - Speaker 2
Well, I got a text message the other day from a good friend of mine and he said listening to the album was like that scene in Ratatouille when he, like, eats, eats, eats, like, the lasagna and takes him back through time.

[02:01:58.380] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Never tasted anything so good before and.

[02:02:02.940] - Speaker 2
I thought that was really cool.

[02:02:07.300] - Speaker 1
Shall we wander?

[02:02:08.570] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[02:02:09.280] - Speaker 2
Wishes.

[02:02:24.380] - Speaker 3
Different routes. Different routes.
