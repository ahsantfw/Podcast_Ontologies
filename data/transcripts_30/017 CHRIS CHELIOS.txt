[00:00:14.840] - Speaker 2
I'm going to ask you a lot of dumb questions because I don't know anything about hockey.

[00:00:26.370] - Speaker 1
That's why I told my daughter, Trag. I don't think he follows hockey, but you know he's not You read something? You absorb everything, though. You know everything. That's what I always told Eddie. I said, I know more about music than you do about hockey, so lay off, okay? Laird, too. I said, Get on the ice one time, Laird. We'll see what happens to you. Yeah, thanks. I was flattered to be asked to do this. This is awesome.

[00:00:49.260] - Speaker 2
That's so cool. I wouldn't have thought of it, but you reached out. It's like, Oh, he's here. We're here. Let's do this.

[00:00:53.900] - Speaker 1
My wife's going, That's awesome. She never gets excited. She loves you. Oh, that's nice.

[00:01:02.030] - Speaker 2
How do we begin? Let's see. Try to describe to me, I mean, you're talking to a child. What are the basic rules of hockey? What are the positions?

[00:01:13.010] - Speaker 1
Honestly, I started because my father played soccer. He's a Greek immigrant, and he felt like the positions in soccer, if he played soccer, were very similar. You had forwards, you had defensemen, you had wingers. In that sense, they had goals, nets. That's why you first got interested in hockey. When I started skating outdoors, there were no rules. It's just like playing street basketball or pickup basketball, but the speed of it caught my... It was just something I really enjoyed doing as a kid. But the similarities of soccer. That was my dad's whole thing why he wanted me to start playing.

[00:01:48.690] - Speaker 2
Is hockey the fastest of the main sport? It seems like it might be the fastest.

[00:01:54.080] - Speaker 1
They did say at one point, for sure, the fastest sport on two feet. But some of these guys now, these football players, the way they run, and that's different. They're only sprinting. But at the end of the day, you're only going about 20 miles an hour. I think these guys can run 20 miles an hour in football. I'm not quite sure. But as far as football, stop and go, there's whistle to whistle. You only play 12 minutes of actual playing time in football. Whereas hockey, when you're playing, you're playing, you're moving the whole time that the time is going on. The clock stops when the whistle blows and the clock starts. So you're moving a lot faster for a lot longer than any other sport, that's for sure.

[00:02:31.600] - Speaker 2
And when... Like, basic rules, how long is it?

[00:02:34.300] - Speaker 1
Generally, you're on the ice for a minute shift, depending on if you're in the other team's offensive zone or you're playing defense. If you're playing in your end, generally, you're working a lot harder trying to defend.

[00:02:44.570] - Speaker 2
It's like a minute of sprinting? Basically, yeah.

[00:02:46.670] - Speaker 1
Then you just know, the players know. Obviously, the coaches will dictate which line is up next. Usually, you have four lines up front, and you have six defensemen, three pairs, and you just know. But the coach will dictate who goes out next. It's just up to you. If there's no stop, as you got it called changing on the fly without a whistle, you actually change as the play is going on when it's safe, or when there's a whistle, you just change lines.

[00:03:11.480] - Speaker 2
There are offensive players and defensive players. It's not the same people doing both.

[00:03:15.440] - Speaker 1
No. It's crazy because the way sports have the evolution of sports, you think that at some point, they're going to have guys that play both sides like football did that back in the day, right? Now that guys are so well-trained and the fitness thing, I wouldn't be shocked. There's been a few players that have played forward and defense, but it's pretty rare that the guys be able to play both ways. You got to be able to skate backwards or if you're a defenseman, a lot of the forwards, they grow up and they don't really skate backwards, so they're not very good at it.

[00:03:46.120] - Speaker 2
I imagine it's hard to skate backwards.

[00:03:47.730] - Speaker 1
Not if you start as a defenseman. I started as a forward, so I had a tough time. I switched at 17, so I had enough college time to actually get good at it. I just got lucky. I played defense a lot as a kid, too, just because you get more ice time because there's less guys, right? Six guys.

[00:04:04.340] - Speaker 2
What would be the difference in being on the offensive side or the defensive side in terms of why would someone be better at one than the other?

[00:04:15.110] - Speaker 1
Like me, I played center. I played forward for my first 16 years of hockey, so I had some offensive skills. There are defensemen that are just stay home, defensive defensemen. Then you got guys like me that are offensive, guys like Kael McCar, Ray Bork, Hall coffee. Bobby Orr was a perfect example of a guy that played defense but had tremendous skills and could play offense and contribute scoring goals and getting assists. Basically, if you want to be known as an offensive forward, you got to have some skill to be able to join the rush and be able to finish and score goals.

[00:04:49.270] - Speaker 2
Yeah. The offense is mainly about scoring goals. Yep. And the defense is shutting down the- Shutting guys down.

[00:04:55.730] - Speaker 1
It's like anything else, you got shutdown guys. Usually, your top two defensemen, they're your best defensemen out of the six, and they're the shutdown guys to play against the other team's top players. It's matchups. There's all kinds of matchups similar to other sports, basketball, football, and that plays into it, too.

[00:05:12.670] - Speaker 2
You think there's a difference playing on the ice than playing on either wood or grass, like in other sports?

[00:05:17.400] - Speaker 1
You can't skate, you can't play. That's the biggest difference. It sounds simple, but anybody could run. Lacrosse is a great sport, but they don't translate into hockey players just because they can have stick, and it's typically the same type of rules as hockey. But no, I think that's the biggest reason why you only have so many hockey players, or it's not a national sport because there's a lot of warm weather states that just don't have that opportunity in the wintertime to learn how to skate. Because if it was two seasons all over the country, you'd see a lot more hockey. It'd be as big as baseball, football. But unfortunately, you have the states where it's grown, out West, obviously, with Wayne Gretsky, he When he got traded at LA, that just started a whole thing out West. And now you see Austin Matthews is from Phoenix. This other kid, Robertson from Dallas, is from LA. So now it's not odd to see these kids popping up from all these warm weather states.

[00:06:15.660] - Speaker 2
And in Canada, it's everywhere. It's ubiquitous in Canada.

[00:06:19.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Let them say what they want. They think it's their sport, but it's their only sport. You don't count crawling. So basically, every big kid in Canada, they play hockey.

[00:06:29.960] - Speaker 2
Everybody plays.

[00:06:30.650] - Speaker 1
We got our big athletes. They put football, baseball, basketball, and hockey tends to be smaller. The American players are smaller for whatever reason, most likely because they weren't big enough to play football, baseball or basketball. Not necessarily baseball. That's the same type as hockey, the size of guys.

[00:06:52.230] - Speaker 2
What's the culture of hockey like in Canada? Because you got to play in Canada. You started in Canada.

[00:06:57.490] - Speaker 1
Montreal, I don't think there's a better place that I could have broken in as far as the history and the tradition, the culture they built, the French-Canadians. I had no idea what I was getting into, but I actually hate to show my age. I played with Guilla Fleur, Bob Ganey, Larry Robinson. I always said, breaking in with the Canadians was like getting a Harvard degree. If I was 20 years old, breaking in with a team with no history. I've seen a lot of guys fail because they come into the league at 18 or 19 and have no leadership. I had every advantage in the world coming in and I just listen and shut my mouth like a rookie should because I knew the success that these guys had had in the past. How can you question anything they do or say?

[00:07:39.570] - Speaker 2
How much of it is really a team sport? Is it about somebody who's great or does the team have to be great to really make it work?

[00:07:48.170] - Speaker 1
There can be great individual players in any sport, but the great ones make the players around them better. I guess that's what I would say. That's a team player. There's a lot of guys that He scored a lot of goals that meant nothing. They don't play the system. One guy comes to mind from the NBA, and not a knock against him, I love him, would be Allen Iverson. At his time, he was one of the best basketball players in the world, but he didn't make anybody around him better. That's why Michael, I think all around, he just made everybody around him better. He's a great example, MJ, of that. But yeah, you can't do it on your own in hockey. Very seldom can a guy take over a series in the playoffs or a game It's the same, possibly, here and there. But once you get your shutdown, guys, you shut down one guy. If you're not a team player, you're irrelevant in the game most of the times.

[00:08:37.810] - Speaker 2
Explain the fighting and violent aspect of hockey, which is just... It's wild. I think for people who don't watch hockey, they don't understand that it's part of the game. It is actually part of the game that there'll be a fight where people really get hurt, and that's accepted as part of the game.

[00:08:58.340] - Speaker 1
Yeah. In this world now with all this sensitivity and so aware of injuries and concussions, they're trying to take it out slowly, but it's still, at the end of the day, the most exciting part of the game because of fans, and it seems almost barbaric that a sport does allow fighting. I'm thinking it's going to get to the point in the near future where if you do get in a fight, you're just kicked out for that game. In the American League, which is a league just below the NHL, now, if you get in a fight, you get suspended for a game, you get another fight, you get two games, four games, six games. So at some point, you don't want to pay the suspensions. You don't get paid when you get suspended. So slowly but surely, I think they're going to wean it out of the game.

[00:09:39.280] - Speaker 2
But it'll make the game less exciting.

[00:09:40.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah, but you don't want the guys up in the blue suits for accountability. You want the guys on the ice. Then that's where the respect factor kicks in. It's always been policed by the players, and it's always worked. But in the same token, no one's ever really gotten hurt bad from fights, but why wait for it to happen? That's the other argument.

[00:10:01.610] - Speaker 2
Where's the line? I mean, you have weapons. You could kill the other guy.

[00:10:07.220] - Speaker 1
Then you're going to use your sticks more. That's right.

[00:10:09.370] - Speaker 2
I'm asking, where was the line of what's okay to do, what's not okay? Where was the line, the violent line?

[00:10:17.640] - Speaker 1
Well, there was. When I started in the '80s, '83, the players had that respect for each other. No one would go after a skilled player if you were a tough guy. There was just that unwritten rule. You don't do that. But if someone goes after your best player, then you go after their best player, and then it stops real quick. No one didn't touch Wayne Gretssky because he had McSorley, and he had McCleland, and he had Semenko. They did it out of respect to him. Now, playoffs, it's no rules. It's a survival of the fittest. If you could take out Gretssky, or you could take out me or any other player, it was on. But you could elbow a guy and put him out of a series and only get a two-minute penalty. I got cured by two back-to-back four-game suspensions. That's 150 grand back in the '90s. That's a lot of money. So I got cured real quick. You adjust to the rules. But at the end of the day of the play-outs early in the series, you knock your best- If you take out the best player of the other team, it screws up the whole series for them.

[00:11:15.530] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And that's why I don't understand. I'm watching football, for example. If I'm a linebacker, I'm taking out Tom braided, I don't care if it's 15 yards or even get ejected, take him out, you're winning the game or your chances are increased immensely. But like I said, you'll see now more and more players are getting hurt for longer periods of time. Mostly because the rules change. There's no hooking, no holding. They want offense. But at the same token, a lot of guys are getting hurt.

[00:11:45.030] - Speaker 2
What were some of the bad situations you saw or participated in?

[00:11:49.380] - Speaker 1
Oh, my God. The brawls, I guess. The worst thing I did, it was a payback hit. I knocked out this Brian Proctor in the playoffs in the hospital for two weeks. But he had broken two of my fingers prior to that, and it was just payback.

[00:12:06.270] - Speaker 2
You think when he did that, did he do it on purpose?

[00:12:09.170] - Speaker 1
Well, he slashed me on purpose for sure. But he slashed heavy.

[00:12:12.310] - Speaker 2
He had a reputation of slashing hands. The slashing is using the stick and hitting the guy's hands. Yeah.

[00:12:18.220] - Speaker 1
And all players know where there's no padding. So you can get between the wrist and the glove. You can get between the arm and here or in the back of the leg or that thing, that nerve on the side of your knee, you hit that, you got upto for four weeks. So players are aware of that. So as progressively the equipment got better, you're able to cover that. But I got attacked by Ron Hextal the last game, and it's still a big thing for a goalie to go after a player at the end of the game. And he came at me swinging his stick like a-Do you know what inspired him to do that? Because I took out his player. It was just payback for taking out one of his. But again, I've been lucky. I deserved everything I got because once I got playoffs, I was going after. I would target guys and not necessarily hurt them against the boards, no way, because I don't want to break anybody's neck. That would be the worst thing, and I would never do that. But an elbow to the head, that was allowed and tolerated back then.

[00:13:14.850] - Speaker 2
So whatever you could do to take them out of the game and maybe out of the series, but not kill them or cripple them.

[00:13:20.750] - Speaker 1
Exactly, right? Okay.

[00:13:22.100] - Speaker 2
I just want to make sure I understand where the line was. Yeah. Like I said- Even in the playoffs, you wouldn't want to cripple somebody.

[00:13:27.980] - Speaker 1
No, no, no. Never hit a guy from behind because defenseless. And that's the worst thing you do is push a guy when he's three, four feet from the boards. It doesn't happen often. Most of the time, what does happen is because the player turns his back at the last second and the guy can't hold up. But guys that generally in the hockey, when you're a kid, they put a stop sign on the back of the kid's helmets. So kids are aware of that to teach them not to hit from behind.

[00:13:54.340] - Speaker 2
When you're going fast on the ice, how quickly can you stop?

[00:13:59.290] - Speaker 1
As quick as you have Really? Yeah. It's like anybody else. They wonder people that don't know hockey, but it's like anything else.

[00:14:05.760] - Speaker 2
When you start young-You could stop dead. On a dime, yeah. From full speed, dead.

[00:14:10.690] - Speaker 1
Maybe you get about 6 inches, you'll slide 6 inches, but it all depends how much weight you put on your feet. You could slide 5 feet sideways and stop and come to a slow stop, but most of the time, you're stopping, starting, stopping real quick so you can get going the other way.

[00:14:26.400] - Speaker 2
How old were you when you decided to retire?

[00:14:30.050] - Speaker 1
48. Maybe about two years, too.

[00:14:32.890] - Speaker 2
Let's talk about that. How old were the other players on your team when you were 48?

[00:14:37.940] - Speaker 1
22, some of them, 23. Like I said, I was just lucky. You were there for a lot of my training, and I'll throw Wild Man. When I was 39, I started training with Don at 29.

[00:14:52.750] - Speaker 2
How did you meet Don? Tell me the story of meeting Don.

[00:14:54.730] - Speaker 1
Gabby, me and Gabby Reece, we had the same trainer in Venice. One day, she said, You got to meet my boyfriend, Laird, and his friend. They're crazy. They'd love to hang out with you. So I go, Sure. So I met him at Coogies. They said, Let's go mountain bike riding tomorrow. I'd never been mountain bike riding. I go, How bad can it be? It was bad. They ditched me out in the Canyon. They end up at Coogies. I show up three hours. They're gone. I'm bleeding. But I was hooked. Don was when an animal he was.

[00:15:24.600] - Speaker 2
So inspiring.

[00:15:25.680] - Speaker 1
Yes. And he was my mentor for the last 20 something years. It's hard to believe Met him when he was 60, and he just passed five years ago, four years ago, I believe. But it was like a drug addiction to Don. He made you feel guilty.

[00:15:38.990] - Speaker 2
The coolest person I ever met in my life. The coolest person on the planet.

[00:15:42.100] - Speaker 1
After you. You got a different vibe than Don. No, no, no.

[00:15:44.980] - Speaker 2
Don was incredible. So inspiring. Just want to hang around him. And always positive. Yep.

[00:15:52.130] - Speaker 1
He kept us together.

[00:15:53.000] - Speaker 2
Great outlook on life.

[00:15:53.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah, he kept it. When there's any drama or anything, Don would fix it like that. Most of the time, like I said, whether it was training in his gym in the basement three days a week or the mountain biking or dune bug ride, anything. Don, he's helicopter snowboarding two months before he died. He's insane. I've never met anybody even close to him in my life. But he really made a difference for me, my longevity, because you add my training and then you throw the mountain bike in. And he had those Kaiser gym equipment where air, compressor air, and it was smooth. But I'd I would have been stronger in my life. And a credit to that, that's what last till '48. I never lost my desire to play. I lost my opportunity. But at 48, it's going to happen.

[00:16:41.100] - Speaker 2
Was there any times early in your career where you thought, this is it, I'm I'm not going to be able to do this anymore?

[00:16:46.760] - Speaker 1
Only when things weren't going good in Chicago. It was '99. We had a bad team. It was going through a rebuild, and they were trying to convince me to retire and be in management. And I'm just thinking, God, I got some more left on me. It's just a team. Maybe I need a change. And that's when I asked for the trade to go to Detroit. Ten more years, two Stanley Cups. So luckily, I made the right decision. But like I said, I loved it. Every minute of it, there was nothing I didn't like, including the travel. When you have kids, that makes it a little harder because you miss a lot of the kids' things. But now that my daughter has two kids and she's working in the NHL as a broadcaster, she gets it. You do what you love, and hopefully you have a good spouse to cover up for the time you're not there. I was lucky enough to have a great wife who raised four kids, and it wasn't easy. I know that, but she did a heck of a job, and I was lucky enough to have her.

[00:17:40.850] - Speaker 2
How long is the hockey season?

[00:17:43.050] - Speaker 1
Same as basketball. It goes from October and playoff start April. Then playoff, it's the hardest championship to win. You're going four best of seven rounds. You could play it two and a half months, and it's every other day, basically. You might get a break if there's a layoff between other teams that didn't sweep their series, but there's no question it's the hardest trophy to win in all pro sports. You go two and a half months, and by the end of that two and a half months, if you make it to the finals, you're dead.

[00:18:12.360] - Speaker 2
Then what does it take? If you make it to the finals, what's left?

[00:18:17.650] - Speaker 1
All your mindset is you're here, you don't want to lose in the finals. And guys say they'd rather lose first round than go to the finals. But the further you go, the more exciting it is. I don't care. I've lost in the finals three times. Yeah, It hurts worse when you get that far, but it's still the ride to the finals is amazing. It just gets more and more the energy from the quarters to the semis to the final. There's nothing better, and you're still relevant. When you're sitting home watching these guys play, you're wishing it was you. Like I said, I'm lucky. I made the playoffs every year except once. I made the playoffs 25 years. I think I have the lead for playoffs. Yeah, even Gordie how I love dropping that one. But yeah.

[00:19:01.020] - Speaker 2
So you're in the playoffs 25 times.

[00:19:02.800] - Speaker 1
25 years out of 26. Even Gretzky, Messier, I have bragging rights over those guys, and I'm just a kid from the south side, so I'm lucky.

[00:19:09.510] - Speaker 2
It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable.

[00:19:12.620] - Speaker 1
Yeah, great teammates, great teams. But at the end of the day, it's still pretty ironic that these guys didn't... I talked to Messier, we do ESPN together. I can't believe he missed the playhouse 11 times. He goes down as one of the greatest leaders ever. So something about it. I've just been lucky. Always in the mix.

[00:19:28.870] - Speaker 2
Yeah. And how many How many times have you gone to the Olympics?

[00:19:31.350] - Speaker 1
Four. Would have been six if it wasn't for the professional. They started letting amateurs, and then... Yeah, but four is enough. Only 22 guys make it every Olympics, right? You got to be lucky to be chosen as that. My timing was perfect. I went as an amateur once, and then as a pro three times. The last one in Salt Lake, obviously, we lost to Canada, but it's probably the greatest hockey ever involved in one of the greatest games. We beat Russia two games before. So had Herb Brooks, a legendary Herb Brooks in the 1980 Miracle on Ice. It was his last time coaching before he passed. So I look back and it's amazing. Crazy.

[00:20:10.550] - Speaker 2
When you're in it, you don't realize the-No.

[00:20:13.700] - Speaker 1
I'd listen to some of your podcasts and some of your interviews. For me, I didn't want to be a hockey player. That's not growing up. I like baseball. And realistically, you're not going to make it as a pro hockey player from my generation, from where I'm from. And so everything was a bonus. There's no pressure on me to become a hockey player. I was never disappointed when I got cut. Two years back to back, I was out of hockey in San Diego.

[00:20:38.380] - Speaker 2
Were you viewed as an outsider because you weren't Canadian?

[00:20:41.570] - Speaker 1
I was the only American for two years in Moosejohn. I took it like... It was tough. That's where I learned how to fight. It wasn't a good learning process. I got beat up a lot because I'd never been in a fight on the ice. And I was small. I was lucky. When I was 18 to 19, I grew about three inches.

[00:21:00.070] - Speaker 2
And then I learned how to fight. Maybe the fighting, maybe your body had to build up in response. It's like, if we're going to get beat up, we got to get bigger.

[00:21:06.660] - Speaker 1
Yeah, maybe my brain's telling me you don't want to get punched in the head that much. So yeah, I never thought of it that way. But all I do is hit a bag and got in shape. When When I got in a fight, I just wanted to punch as long as I possibly could. That's all. No tactic, no nothing, just wide open. Then you start getting smart because you can't trade off with guys that are bigger. And I took some boxing lessons, and I got just good enough. But then I go to college for two years, and there's no fighting allowed in college, so I lost it going into pro, but it comes back quick. When you're facing someone with no gloves on, you're going, I don't want to get hit in the goddamn nose again.

[00:21:41.550] - Speaker 2
Do you take your gloves off in a fight? Automatic.

[00:21:43.900] - Speaker 1
Really? That's the honorable thing to do. Sometimes guys wear shields. If you're honorable, you take your mask off. So it's open season on your head, basically.

[00:21:54.190] - Speaker 2
I love the idea that you took boxing lessons for hockey.

[00:21:57.430] - Speaker 1
Yeah, a lot of guys did, especially tough guys. But One thing that you don't realize, boxers don't have shirts on, right? So there's nothing to grab. In hockey, you can grab a guy's sleeve. And predominantly, most guys are right-handed. Unfortunately, if you pick the wrong arm when you go to grab it, you're going to get a left first one right in the face. But you learn, and then you The word gets around the league, who's lefty, who's righty. So there's a lot of... You don't want to get punched without a glove on. It hurts.

[00:22:21.940] - Speaker 2
Trust me. How much does fear and intimidation play into the game?

[00:22:26.210] - Speaker 1
Again, back to fear it and fight. I swear to God, Rick, I have blacked out during fights, not even knowing afterwards, just because of the fear factor. That adrenaline rush. It's hard to believe that sometimes it gets so wild in the fight and you get so scared that you forget everything. Before you know what the fight over, you're going, okay, you're feeling your face. You don't feel anything on your head. Okay, I'm okay. But yeah, and there's guys you just don't fight. Sometimes when the score is 6-0, there's no reason to fight. Sometimes you get in a fight early game to set the tone or send a message. But I was never a thinker, so I got in all kinds of trouble.

[00:23:06.830] - Speaker 2
The fighting was really to win or revenge.

[00:23:11.270] - Speaker 1
Those were the two. Honestly, most of the time, revenge, whether someone hit one of your better players. Or basically, for me, when I was playing at home in Chicago because that old stadium was real special, like your studio here, and you just felt like you owed it to the fans. If you were down by three or four goals at home, I would just a fight in the last five minutes just for the hell of it. Just to please the fans. So the fans would cheer. Amazing. I hated losing fights at home, but I didn't lose too many at home. I picked the right guy or just got lucky.

[00:23:41.150] - Speaker 2
Did you ever get booed?

[00:23:43.480] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. I was like Any opposing rink, anywhere I went, I got booed. They hated me everywhere. I couldn't go out to bars, restaurants in those towns. Boston wouldn't dare go out anywhere. Philadelphia, after I almost killed Brian Propp. That was never going to go out.

[00:24:00.050] - Speaker 2
What What happened in that example in Philadelphia?

[00:24:03.070] - Speaker 1
When I elbowed him, and he was knocked out before he hit the ice. Then to make things worse, he hit his back of his head on the ice, too. I went to go visit him in the hospital because my house was two blocks away in after all, but he wouldn't see me. I'm going, okay, whatever. But then 20 years later, I meet him at a funeral, and he's telling him how it should really bother him. I go, look, I'm sorry. I had no idea. We're good. I actually worked on his dad's farm in Moose jaw. It's crazy in a circle, the small world it But yeah, that was me. I love getting under people's skin. Vancouver, I wasn't allowed in Vancouver. After what I did there, after a game, I was picked first star, and I bit a big circle, which is a no-no. You take a victory lap. You only take the victory lap at home. I did it on the road, and they were throwing bottles and cans. Wow. Yeah. But like I said, I deserved everything I got because I liked shoving it up their ass. They're trying to take my head off, and by the end of the game, I'm like, I can't wait to stick it to these guys.

[00:24:59.610] - Speaker 1
And I I did it quite a bit, but I was on the short end of it a lot, too.

[00:25:03.440] - Speaker 2
Would fights ever continue from the game into... If you ran into someone after the game, was that bad?

[00:25:10.480] - Speaker 1
Yeah. You know what? Quite honestly, it's a common knowledge that two hockey players get in a fight, and if they ran into each other in a bar after, they drink beers together, or they just fly out and hate each other and turn around the other way and can't stand them. Now, there's only a couple of guys over the course of my career, Cam Neely, who I'm good friends with now, but there was a guy named Dale Hunter, I swear he had the eyes of the devil, and he was a good player, and he got suspended all the time. But he scared the shit out of me. When I was on the ice, I just made sure I was aware when he was… He got me twice, blew up my knee twice from behind. But this guy was He might have been hated more than me. You just got to be aware of guys like that. But push comes to shove. Hockey players are great guys. If you run into someone, even when you're on all-star breaks, if you're in Florida and you see one of your worst enemies, you're go up and start drinking with him and have a beer with him and his girlfriend or wife.

[00:26:03.440] - Speaker 1
It's just been the way it has been forever for hockey.

[00:26:05.430] - Speaker 2
Because everyone knows that's the game. It's like what happens in the game happens in the game, and it's about winning, and you do it, it takes to win. Everyone does it. To some degree or another.

[00:26:15.770] - Speaker 1
There's very few guys who can't separate it in the league. Then you're always going to, like any other group of athletes or businesses, you're going to have that odd guy who's just an absolute douche. But not so much in hockey because, again, it wouldn't be allowed in the room.

[00:26:29.220] - Speaker 2
It seems like it would It's going to put itself out if there's an understanding between the players of a culture. It's in the culture. If you're not following the rules of the culture, you'll probably get pushed out of the culture.

[00:26:40.970] - Speaker 1
Yeah. The only thing that's changed a little bit is because of the Euros. Now with all the Europeans coming over. The culture has changed a little bit as opposed to a more physical, aggressive game. Now they're creating an offensive, skilled game. I guess they figured it's better for the viewers. That's why smaller players can play now. All the rules they've changed benefit the forwards and offensive skills. Defenseman, it's tough. That's why you really have to know how to skate to play in this league as a defenseman.

[00:27:08.420] - Speaker 2
From the beginning of when you played until now, what have been all of the rule changes in order from the beginning?

[00:27:16.180] - Speaker 1
Well, like I said, the biggest have been stick infractions. You cannot hold anybody up with your stick, which is a big deal at any time on the ice.

[00:27:24.350] - Speaker 2
Because that would slow down a fight.

[00:27:26.110] - Speaker 1
It stops everything. It stops the speed.

[00:27:28.090] - Speaker 2
It would prevent a fight.

[00:27:28.770] - Speaker 1
Not necessarily the fight, It's basically like if someone wants to go up to the ice and join them, if you hook them and stop them, their momentum is changed. You just go right by them. Now you're in front of them. So it's just hooking is the one and interference. In basketball, you're allowed to throw a pick.

[00:27:43.100] - Speaker 2
Were people getting hurt hooking?

[00:27:44.620] - Speaker 1
No, don't get hurt.

[00:27:45.500] - Speaker 2
Why did they change that rule?

[00:27:47.470] - Speaker 1
Because it was such a disadvantage for offensive players to just reel a guy in with your stick. They shouldn't allow hooking. I see. And then interference, somewhat like basketball where they throw pics, you can't do that in hockey either. That was a big thing to slow guys down. Let's say they dumped the tuck into the zone. When a defenseman is going back to get the tuck so you could protect them, one of the forwards will get in front of theirs and slow them down. Now you can't do that. So it's open season on defenseman. They just come full speed and run them. That's why more and more guys are getting hurt.

[00:28:20.830] - Speaker 2
That's amazing. Yeah.

[00:28:21.650] - Speaker 1
You can't interfere anymore to protect your players, and that's a bad thing. You should be able to get in front. As long as you're moving your feet, it should be okay. If you're standing still and really interfering, then it should be a two-minute penalty. But like I said, as a defenseman, it's no advantage to play in this league.

[00:28:37.260] - Speaker 2
For the Olympics, you play on the American team, and there's a Canadian team as well, yes.

[00:28:41.820] - Speaker 1
Yes. All the countries, and that's The American-Canadian rivalry has been built up because the Americans have finally caught up. At the end of the day, though, when it comes for the big game, Canada always seems to rise, and they got that swagger.

[00:28:55.530] - Speaker 2
But it's the culture. It's like it seems like it's been in their culture forever. It's newer, like you're really the beginning of it in some ways.

[00:29:04.500] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Other than an '80 team, the '80 team, that paved the way for Americans. No one was looking at American players. But once that '80 team won the gold medal, there's only a handful of guys that really made it to the NHL, Mark Johnson being one of them, the defenseman who won four cups for the Islanders, Davy Christian, the Brottens. But that paved the way for our group of guys. We had more guys make it. They were starting to look at more college players because Because at that point, the '80 team was all amateurs. But, yeah, our rivalry with Canada is second and none. It used to be Canada-Russia, but now we've caught them. But it's good. It's great for hockey, the World Cups. We still have the only bragging rights for beating Canada, 96 for the World Cup, which is a big thing for the Americans because we've never beat them in any other tournament other than the 1980 Olympics.

[00:29:53.640] - Speaker 2
What was the history of the Stanley Cup? What do you know about the Stanley Cup?

[00:29:57.500] - Speaker 1
I didn't know anything about it until I got to Montreal and I see the 22 banners up there. I'm going, Jesus Christ, these guys, they weren't kidding. It's like the New York Yankees of Canada. Like I said, to be drinking with Henry Richard and John Beliveau, and these guys were all still around in the search of arts. You learn quick about that. The fans were so knowledgeable about the game. If you missed a pass or you made a bad play, they would boo you. It didn't matter if you were in the first place, they'd boo you. They were so critical, the fans. Then you had the whole English, American, French thing where the Quebec was actually trying to separate from Canada. And I got caught in the middle of that. The French media is ripping me. The US media, or American or English papers are trying to stick up for me. I got caught up in all that. It was insane. So I literally got traded at one point because of that. And we won the Stanley Cup in '86. They traded seven Americans because the headlines were no longer a French traditional team. There goes six American players over the summer.

[00:30:58.520] - Speaker 1
So it was a big thing. And I didn't understand it going into it. But at the end of the day, now they're probably wishing that they didn't do that because '91 was the last time any Canadian teams won the Stanley Cup. Wow. And they would die. American, English, French, Canadian, European. They should have not, but they didn't know any better. It was politics.

[00:31:21.100] - Speaker 2
Amazing. Yeah. So you've won three?

[00:31:23.640] - Speaker 1
Three cups, one with Montreal. And I said, jeez, second year in, I'm going to win a bunch of these cups.

[00:31:29.740] - Speaker 2
Well, you did. Three is a bunch.

[00:31:31.210] - Speaker 1
Three is, I know. I compared other guys that never get to touch it or like Ray Bork, one of the greatest ever one time. Some guys never win it. Dan Moreno is a great example. Jim Kelly, what happened to him in the Super Bowl. So It took me 17 years to win another one, but I sure appreciate it in Detroit. We had, I think, 11 Hall of Famers on that team. It would have been a huge disappointment not to win with that team. Then 2006, we won it again. I wasn't such an impact player or relevant, but I still got to play in a handful of games in the finals. At the end of the day, you're still part of a team that wins. Absolutely. There's a lot of- Absolutely.

[00:32:06.480] - Speaker 2
Yeah, a lot of great memories. There's a lot that goes into a team that wins, both on the ice and off the ice.

[00:32:13.870] - Speaker 1
Right. At that age, at 46, these young kids, and I'll still take experience over youth 90% of the time, especially when it comes to the big games. Hockey, they're respectful. The kids listen. When you got an older group in the room, it It helps these guys a ton, so they don't feel the pressure. If they face adversity or they're struggling, that's where I came in. Then I think I played four games because the injuries during the plus. Well, thank God we won every game, so I felt pretty good about that. It's a good way to go out. Not necessarily because I felt I did something right, but I didn't win it wrong.

[00:32:49.760] - Speaker 2
No, you were useful on the team, and you win. If you win, it's good.

[00:32:53.890] - Speaker 1
That's it. That's all I cared. For me, it wasn't about the individual trophies or anything. It was wins. I want to say I got more wins than anybody in the playhouse. I also got more losses than anybody, but that's because I played in more playoff games than anybody.

[00:33:07.720] - Speaker 2
Is it fun to play even when you lose?

[00:33:10.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's just fun. Yeah, and you play so many games, 82 games a year, the The good thing is you lose a game. I've lost sleep a couple of times during a regular season over that. But the good thing is you're right back at it a day or two days later, and you just put it behind you. That's why it's great that there's so many games. Play-off losses much tougher, especially when there's high expectations. You win the President's trophy, the best team in the league, and then you get knocked out first round. That President trophy means nothing. But you look back, and again, I don't say that the trophies don't mean anything. It's great for the goal tenders when you win those Jennings trophies, the best goalies in the league for goals against. So as a defense, when you take a little pride, you have that when your goalies are winning individual trophies. For me, I played in front of some of the goalies.

[00:33:57.210] - Speaker 2
As defense, you're an extension of the goalie, essentially. Exactly.

[00:33:59.870] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Some of the goalies, if you're winning 3-1, I can go out there and try and score the fourth goal, but I'd rather try and protect the lead for the goal tenders, goals against average to stay down and our goals against to stay down. I had Patrick Erroa, one of the greatest, Eddie Belfort, Dominic Hasek, All these guys are Hall of Famers, and that's part of the reason for my success, too, is the goal tenders that played behind me.

[00:34:24.840] - Speaker 2
The goal tenders are... What makes a goal tender good is being able to predict where the puck is going to go because you can't see where it's going. Yep, you're spot on.

[00:34:35.510] - Speaker 1
Guys like Dominic Hasek, I would say, out of all these guys, he had that gift and ability of if the puck's coming, he would see a stick in the slot 30 feet away and would put his blocker up just in case that stick was going to tip it. That's the gift he had of being able to have that vision. I always called it fighter pilot vision type of thing where you see everything around you. And that's what made the great ones. And like you said, there's so much traffic and guys getting in front of you. But these guys just have a knack. Let's say there's two guys in front of them. Well, he just assumes the puck's not getting through them. So he just comes over to the other side where the puck is coming. So it's a gift for sure. Like a rebounder like Dennis Rodman He had just that neck. He wasn't bigger than anybody, but he had that sixth sense of always being in the right spot and always outrebounding. It didn't matter if the guy's four inches bigger. He ended up with the ball.

[00:35:25.310] - Speaker 2
Interesting. I got to interview Phil Jackson a couple of weeks ago, which was incredible. We talked about Rodman a little bit. It's funny because the way the press portrays him is crazy and out of control. What Phil was saying is he trained every day. He showed up at every game. He studied everything he needed to study, and none of the extracurricular stuff impacted his game in the least. Not at all, zero. In some ways, if the idea is to play the game and win, and if he's excelling at the game, what does it matter if he goes out at night?

[00:36:04.900] - Speaker 1
They still care. Management still cares. Why? I don't know. But if you look in Detroit, he got in that trouble. That was something else, a personal thing. Then in San Antonio, he went off the deep end. They didn't win. And then San Antonio. Was it San Antonio? One of the tech teams down there. He's an easy scapegoat. That's why most guys won't do that. If you win, you can do anything. If you start losing, he's an easy guy to He went to blame the finger. He just came into a situation. Trust me, MJ, if he didn't think... Mj didn't think he was doing his job, but I think you watched that. I'm sure you watched that documentary. He showed up every... Some guys, you say that you don't have the ability to just turn on and off. Dennis did. It didn't matter if he was out all night, the night before, somehow he woke up when the game started.

[00:36:51.860] - Speaker 2
Well, Phil said when he found out that Dennis was available, Phil was trepidacious, and he went to Michael and Scottie, and they're like, If we could have that guy on our team, we want him. Because they hated when he was against them.

[00:37:08.620] - Speaker 1
They hated him. Yeah, he could drive you nuts.

[00:37:11.740] - Speaker 2
But if he could be on our team, we want that.

[00:37:14.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah. No, he against matched up against the big centers. I'll never forget, I was at the Utah series. What he did to Malone, he drove Malone crazy. It's just like I played the same way. I was an agitator and get under the guy's skin. I do that to my wife. I could do it to my best friend. I know how to get... I said you're the most annoying, lovable person. One of our mutual friends called me that here in Malibu. But yeah, that's still an art, too, along with his skill level, to be able to get under a guy's skin like that and throw them completely off their game. It's just impossible to ignore him. He's tapping you on the ass on the court.

[00:37:55.190] - Speaker 2
Gamesmanship, I believe it's called. Yeah, right.

[00:37:57.990] - Speaker 1
Gamesmanship. He's never been in a fight. He's He's never thrown a punch, but he somehow he pisses everybody off. The only guys I've ever seen him hit was a cameraman when he fell down and he kicked the cameraman. But I mean, he's a lovable guy. He's got his issues. He got invited to Michael's 60th birthday party, and Michael really wanted him to be there. He wanted. And of course, Dennis missed his flight. But that guy, like he said, I've watched him train. It didn't matter how many people he had waiting for him after the game. He was on treadmill and doing his weights regardless.

[00:38:32.240] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and studying tape and really methodical about what he did. It was not accidental, and it wasn't just he had a lot of energy. He was smart about his play and did his homework hard.

[00:38:46.860] - Speaker 1
He knew the game inside out, and he knew his opponents.

[00:38:50.740] - Speaker 2
Tell me about training in general. How was your training different than other hockey players from the time that you started?

[00:38:58.890] - Speaker 1
I was ahead of the curve for sure, because back then, even the guys that were supposedly in the best shape, all they did was bench press and jog or stationary bike. That was it in the early '80s. I met TR Goodman here out in Venice.

[00:39:11.440] - Speaker 2
How did you meet him? Oh, through Gabby.

[00:39:13.560] - Speaker 1
No, actually, I was in the gym training with Tony Danza. He's the originator of the Malbu Mob, right? Tony's got me doing just coils, and he's got all these this big muscle head bodybuilder guy with him. I looked across the gym, and I saw this guy doing some circuit training with a rope. And I walked over and I said, My name's Chris Cheli. It was his kid, Alan May, from the Washington Capitals, was TR's first client. So I go, Do you mind? I'd like to try this tomorrow. And I was hooked. And there was history from then. I would be going and leaving the house at 5:45 and training with TR. And I was a loose cannon, too. I wasn't Dennis Rodman, but I like to have fun. And I needed something to ground me and be real disciplined. And TR Goodman was perfect for me. If I showed up, you'd remotely smelling like a bud light, he would just give it to me. So for two and a half months of the summer here, I was religiously going to him. No one in the league was doing it at the time. And my skating improved so much, and my strength and endurance And unfortunately, Thierry got so many clients that became known throughout the league.

[00:40:21.270] - Speaker 1
And then he was training guys like Rob Blake. Well, that's not an advantage anymore for me. I think it's a conflict, I was telling him, and I got mad because he's 10 years younger Blakey, and then he wins the Norris Trophy, which is the best defenseman of the league. I'm like, That's not fair, Thierry. So I wouldn't train with anybody else anymore. I wanted to go by myself, and I said, You better show me something different than what we're doing. I needed another edge. And he never did. He couldn't do it, but that's what it was. I was just ahead of the curve and in just that much better shape. And then you add Don and Laird into the mix. I know you started doing the pool stuff with them, and what it did for you was amazing. It changed my life. I believed in it. I believe what Laird and Dawn was doing. I believe what Tiara is doing and a mental game of it. Like, I was into it.

[00:41:05.600] - Speaker 2
Let's talk about Sauna because first time I ever did Sauna was with you. That's right. Completely changed my life. I do it all the time now, nonstop. I know it was probably twelve years ago, something like that a long time ago. Yeah.

[00:41:16.560] - Speaker 1
I mean, I started doing it in college. Actually, I fast forward when I was 18 years old, the team and Moose jaw had this dumpy old sauna, but I just love to sweat. My favorite movie of all time is Raging Bull. Okay, so that in the steamer. He's cut weight. I'm figured, I don't like steamers only because of the noise and you can't read in there and you can't watch TV. I said, I'm going to start making saunas. And I was with two different companies, Infrared and Electric Heat, and started customizing saunas with windows. But ultimately, I think just the sweat. I think Matthew Bacani said at one time, he believes in sweating once a day, and that gets a toxic side to you, whether you drink the stuff they put in the foods. And I never get I'm sick, knock on wood. When my family gets the flu, I get nothing. But it seems like the healthiest thing in the world to do is sweat. Then I started putting the bike in the sun, and word got out. It doesn't get you in better shape. All it does is makes you sweat more and get those toxics out of you.

[00:42:15.520] - Speaker 2
And also mental toughness because it's just so hard and so unpleasant. Exactly. It's like, if you can do that, you can do whatever your regular job is for twice as long because it's just the mental strength of you're enduring terrible things. Yeah. Same It's the same with the ice. When you stay in the ice for a long time, it's like, once you can do that, whatever nonsense you have to deal with in your day becomes much smaller. It's not sitting in ice.

[00:42:39.240] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and training in the mountains, like these guys, the altitude, no different from the sun. You're training the heat, well, then you go play a game. How much easier is it just playing the regular elements, right? Absolutely. I didn't realize it at first, but all of a sudden, I started feeling unbelievable. Like, this is working. I had no lactic acids in me, zero. To this day, I got my daughters, Everybody, they're riding bikes in the sauna. They're all hooked, too. It's amazing. But like I said, I can't think of a healthier thing to do. Everybody's onto it now. I believe the hot-cold treatment.

[00:43:12.210] - Speaker 2
No, but you really flew the flag. It's like, everybody's into it because we thought you'd do it.

[00:43:17.450] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and we got a guy down the street that likes to think he invented it, but we won't mention his name, but his initials are Laird Hamilton. But yeah, I'm glad I brought that.

[00:43:28.280] - Speaker 2
When did you decide to put TV where you could watch TV in the sauna?

[00:43:32.000] - Speaker 1
Because I was spending so much time in there, Rick, and I was getting bored, and I'm thinking, okay, at least I could watch documentaries or sports. You can't stay in it for a two and a half hour game, but you jump in for the 30 minutes, and then you go out, jump in the cold plunge, you come right back.

[00:43:44.830] - Speaker 2
You could definitely stay in the sauna longer if you're distracted, for sure. Oh, yeah. I listen to podcasts and stuff. If I'm really listening, you don't even notice how uncomfortable you are. No.

[00:43:54.690] - Speaker 1
I hate binge watching these TV series, but in a sauna, at least I'm killing two birds with one stone. But like I said, it's something I'd suggest. Women, I would suggest for the infrared because it's not high heat. It's a little more tolerable for women because when they first get in, even 180 degrees, it's not fun. You got to just build up towards the heat, I would guess, right?

[00:44:20.070] - Speaker 2
Was the ice a normal thing for players after games to get in an ice tub?

[00:44:25.450] - Speaker 1
It was like, I'm thinking back to the North Dallas 40, nick Nolte sitting in that It all started in those stainless steel, the Whirlpools. You just fill it with water, dump three buckets of ice in there, and you stay in that for five minutes, and it takes all the inflammation out of your body. Any aches and pains? I don't believe I'm taking medication unless you So you had to and you're prescribed. But instead of taking anti-inflammatories, you just got to get in the cold tub. People don't understand. It's hard to get in that cold tub, but like anything else, once you get used to it, you start 30 seconds and build your way up to a minute. Then before you know it, you're in it for five minutes.

[00:45:01.060] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I remember the first time I went. First time, even going into the ocean in the winter with you. I was terrified. I never did that before. It felt great. It felt great. It's like there's something in our mind that makes it seem scary because we haven't done it. But once you experience it, once you feel the hot, the extreme of the hot, and then the extreme of the cold, and how it makes you feel, completely addicted.

[00:45:25.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and you end on cold, and that tingling is second to none. You have it for a few hours after, and your whole body, your muscles feel revived.

[00:45:32.840] - Speaker 2
It feels so good. I had a guy who had just come from Peru, where he had done these psychedelic experiences with shaman, and he came to do sawn at my old house at down, and we did Sawn and ice. On the first round, he was saying, Wow, this would be really cool to take the medicine and do it in here. Then by the time we got to the fourth round, he's like, Whatever you do, don't take any drugs when you do this because it'll kill you. Yeah, right. It was like it was so intense once you get going. I've never felt better in my life than after a handful of rounds of Sawn and Ice. Yep. Unbelievable what it does for the mind, for the mood.

[00:46:18.270] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I usually do it after workouts in the mornings. That was my time of the day. We just finished now, me and a friend. But at night, if you do it, you sleep like a baby. If you have a tough time sleeping at night, same thing. That just knocks you out if you want to go at night. But I like getting out of the way during the daytime.

[00:46:36.750] - Speaker 2
For some reason, I like it before dinner. That's my favorite. Sunsetty, something about it. I don't know why. I don't like getting in the cold in the morning. Oh, no. Maybe that would make it good. Maybe that means I need it. Hard to say. But I know that later in the day, I feel better doing it.

[00:46:53.260] - Speaker 1
Well, like TH's own, like you said, a lot of it's in your mind, too, right? So I just feel like after I work out and and get in the sun, I'm so tired, but that cold tub gets me going for the rest of the day. It keeps me the adrenaline, that feeling you get like, goosebumps, like the chills. I like that.

[00:47:11.080] - Speaker 2
Tell me about, in general, how would hockey fans differ from other sports fans?

[00:47:16.860] - Speaker 1
The fact that there's fighting and the fans love the fighting, that says enough about the fans. And they like the physical part of it. That's the one thing, the hitting, the aggressiveness. Even though it's become a more a skilled game, there's still a physical aspect that's always going to be a part of it, especially in the playoff. The one thing I will say, unfortunately for the fans, from a TV perspective, if you don't know hockey or you've never been to a game, it's really hard to follow it on TV and understand what's going on because they still haven't figured out because of the speed where the cameras should be. And somewhat like soccer, they should just show the whole ice, and then they need someone like you or in that type of business to give them answer, but so far no one's had it. It's really tough to understand TV.

[00:48:03.350] - Speaker 2
It's too fast to follow on TV. Yeah.

[00:48:05.840] - Speaker 1
From a live sport perspective, I don't think it's a better live sport. Football, way better on TV. It's slower. You get thing. Basketball is one that you can get away with both, I think. I think it's a great sport from TV and hockey. Baseball is what it is. I love baseball more than anything, but it's slow. As a fan, you don't even have to pay attention until you hear the ball hit the bat, basically. Basically. But hockey is a fast game. You can't leave because something's going to happen. It's the play is always going on.

[00:48:36.530] - Speaker 2
How many teams are there in the United States?

[00:48:38.700] - Speaker 1
There's 25 teams, 26 teams in the US. They're talking about expansion, but that disaster in Phoenix, where they're playing in a college rink now in front of 5,000 fans, and that whole Glendale Arena thing backfired on them. But that'll be fixed eventually. But like I said, sometimes it's just tough to sell hockey unless you got a good When you first started playing, you played outside on ice growing up? Yeah. Growing up in Chicago, I learned on two different... When they froze the basketball court over the window, firemen would just show up in the truck and just spray it whenever it needed, and it would freeze. It just seemed like back then, the winters were colder. Now it's been weird weather everywhere. But eventually, when I started having kids, I was putting rinks in our backyards, but outdoor for two years. Then I ended up getting lucky enough that by family, we had just enough money to play competitive hockey and start playing on a regular team in club hockey.

[00:49:35.240] - Speaker 2
Amazing. How did you end up in Malibu?

[00:49:38.940] - Speaker 1
Tony Danza. I'm going to drop Tony Danza's name again. He came to a game at the LA Forum. The Canadians, we just played the Kings, and he was friends with a kid, Russ Cortnell, one of my teammates. So we went to the Forum Club after, and I asked him where he lived, and he told me Malibu. And I'm thinking, jeez, I've seen that in the movies. It looks really cool. He goes, You should come check it out. So It was my first kid, and my wife was pregnant at the time. So we rented for a summer. I go, man, this is exactly how California should be. So rented for another year, and we decided this is where I want to go, and I want to train and get away from everybody because there's too many distractions in Chicago in the summer to have family time. And now I'm here 32 years later.Unbelievable.Yeah. Loving it.Best decision.

[00:50:25.190] - Speaker 1
Yeah. And I love my house, and I don't like the crazy rules and what's going on with the politics. But at the end of the day, I'm lucky enough we're in this little bubble with friends like you and just a group of guys. I love the idea not having to drive more than 10 minutes to get anywhere. It's amazing. Yeah. It's like we're on our own little island here, and it's a really special place, Malibu.

[00:50:50.400] - Speaker 2
What was it like getting the inducted to the Hall of Fame?

[00:50:52.720] - Speaker 1
Honestly, for me, obviously, I was honored, but the biggest thing was having a of my friends and family there crossing the border, which is no easy feat. Three of them got detained in the airport jail. I won't say why, but- But use your imagination. Yeah. I think back, yeah, right. I think back at the party, my mother and father were still alive, which made it really special. My dad's passed since then. But you look back and to be lucky enough to make it to the NHL, and then nobody from my neighborhood, I hope it happens, was ever going to make the Hall of Fame in Hockey from the South Side of Chicago. I shouldn't say never, but-Unlikely.

[00:51:35.380] - Speaker 2
It's in a real fluke.

[00:51:37.620] - Speaker 1
Right. I said that on the stage. It's like a joke that I'm up here. But to have all those people up there and coaches from when I was a kid, and that's what it was all about, to feel how fortunate I was to not only just be in Dr. Hall of Fame, to be able to share it. Just like winning Stanley Cup Championships, it's great. But the best part is your friends family and the parties. It's crazy to see the effect it has. Then my friends don't ever have the chance to go to a Hall of Fame. They don't know a whole lot of guys like that that make it. So a kid rock. Performing at a bar in Toronto. We stole the show, and the Canadians hated it. They absolutely hated it. It was the greatest Hall of Fame party they've ever had. The tradition of being able to have the Stanley Cup and bring it to your house or anywhere. Those guys that bring that Stanley Cup around, those three guys, they couldn't wait. When it was free, they would call me. At some point, I'm getting sick. I go, I don't want to have the Stanley Cup anymore, you guys.

[00:52:40.760] - Speaker 1
But like I said, what it did for my friends, my family, and the memories of all those. I got a photographer that made a book that I'll look through this book till I'm 100 years old. Hopefully, I lived till. It's special. The pictures are amazing.

[00:52:56.530] - Speaker 2
So cool. In the game, Finals. Tell me the mindset of going to war.

[00:53:04.790] - Speaker 1
I mean, it's from day one. That was my thing. I was called the ultimate warrior. I hate talking about myself, but I got to do it here. Yeah, it's okay. But that was my thing, how I competed. It didn't matter if I was in the gym. It didn't matter if I was playing pickleball. It didn't matter what I do. Unfortunately, the legs aren't there anymore to compete, but that was it. I never quit. I didn't want to let the best defenseman on the other team outplay me. That was the bottom line. I didn't really necessarily enjoy winning as much as I feared or hated losing. The one thing that I forget that phrase is the only thing stronger than something is fear. I guess you'd probably know you've heard that, but I just was afraid to lose. I think Johnny McEnroe, good friend of mine, is a perfect example. He never enjoyed winning. He just hated losing so much. I've never seen guy who is more relieved after he won than happy. They're just relieved. But that's his competitiveness. To this day, you're golfing with him. I've lost it, thank God. I was sick of having that in my brain that you have to win.

[00:54:14.770] - Speaker 1
And now I'm so relieved. People think I care when I lose in other sports. In backgammon, I don't care anymore. Thank God, I got rid of that.

[00:54:23.130] - Speaker 2
What do you think changed that allowed that to happen? Because it sounds like this is a much healthier version of yourself.

[00:54:28.830] - Speaker 1
Just the grind. I was tired of the grind, and you played till you're 48. I didn't realize at the time because I wasn't feeling the pressure. I wasn't feeling the grind. But what a relief it was when I retired, I think it was just the world off my shoulders that I didn't have to win anymore. I didn't have to compete anymore. I skate in senior league. These guys are trying their hardest against me. I don't care. I never thought I'd get to that point, but I don't. That's great.

[00:54:54.550] - Speaker 2
Congratulations.

[00:54:55.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah, I lost it, and people don't believe it, but yeah.

[00:54:58.820] - Speaker 2
Has your training changed changed since you stopped playing?

[00:55:01.550] - Speaker 1
Definitely. I got a couple of nagging things that you can't go heavy. The one guy that comes to mind, Clint Eastwood said it one time in an interview, he just believes in moderation. He never did heavy weights. He just kept there. Consistent. I'm just consistent with the body weight, mostly nothing heavy, because when I try and get stronger or go heavier, there goes my knee, there goes my shoulder, there goes his shoulder or elbow. I should know by now. The old saying, if it hurts, don't do it. I've toned it down, mountain bike even staying more on pavement than going in the mountains just because of the pounding. You got to adapt. You're not going to beat for all the time.

[00:55:40.950] - Speaker 2
And you have just as much fun doing it, I imagine.

[00:55:43.480] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. Yeah. Like I said, you just get smarter as you get older, you'd like to think, right?

[00:55:47.820] - Speaker 2
I read a quote where someone said that hurting you was better than winning a Stanley Cup.

[00:55:53.380] - Speaker 1
That would be my good friend, Terry O'Reilly. Yep. Only because his teammate told me that two years later when they were sitting at the bench and he got me, he blew my knee out purposely. He literally cut my legs out. I got pushed from behind right when he was about to hit me from another player, and he just stuck his hip into my side. And that was my first significant knee injury. Wasn't real bad, but it put me out of the playhouse. He got me. And he hated me for years. I won the Norris Trophy as a defenseman, best defenseman of the year. He wouldn't pick me for the All-Star game because he was a coach. He did that two years to me. That's the hate we talked about earlier. Some guys, and they hate with Boston because it was a rival, Montreal, Boston, the original six teams. So many playoff rounds between them. So it was war, and O'Reilly wouldn't let it go. He was from the old school, and he was a tough guy. And I actually had the same number as them, and I liked him. But then when I played against him for the first time, I go, Oh, my God, this guy's a prick.

[00:56:50.340] - Speaker 1
He's going to kill me. We finally made up. We're an alumni game somewhere in Montreal. In Montreal, We just happened to run into each other in one of the food rooms, and he goes, Yeah, we did a lot of stupid things back then. I'm going, Thank God. So we're good now.

[00:57:07.630] - Speaker 2
It's great. It's great. It feels better not having beef with people, no?

[00:57:11.370] - Speaker 1
You know what? I said that about a year ago. I'm done wasting my energy on hate. I truly mean it. If something bothers me, I just eliminate it, and that's it. I move on. I can't believe I'm saying that because that's not me, but it's so much better not to hate. It really is.

[00:57:28.050] - Speaker 2
It really is.

[00:57:29.390] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it feels I ignore, I guess, is what I do now. I just ignore.

[00:57:32.200] - Speaker 2
You're being kind to yourself because when you hate somebody, they don't even know what's going on. You're just tearing yourself up. It's like you're taking care of yourself, which is a good thing to do. Might as well. No one else is going to do it.

[00:57:45.020] - Speaker 1
I'm not quite out of the woods yet, but I'm getting there. Talk a good game, but no. But it's slowly but surely with age and being a grandpa, maybe that's got something to do with it. I don't know what's going on in this world. Who knows? You just You're afraid to say something to someone anymore because you don't know what's going to... Gun, knife. Who knows what's going to happen now? I mind my own business a lot more than I used to. That's for sure. When COVID hit, like everybody else, bored to death, not allowed to leave the house, where everybody's under quarantine. So I got so bored. After six months, I decided to start our own tequila company with a friend, right?

[00:58:21.530] - Speaker 2
Is tequila your drink of choice in general?

[00:58:23.760] - Speaker 1
Bier and tequila. You can't drink tequila all day in the sun. I'm a boater, so I choose beer and just sip on beers. I could drink bud lights until the cows come home. That's just been a gift. I've seen you do it. A gift or a curse. I don't know what it is. I've seen you do it. Then the tequila, it was a friend's idea. He went ahead and did all the legwork going down to Guadalajara, Jalisco, Guadalajara, with the distilleries. And we came up with a great... If there's no such thing as healthy drinking, but it's clean, and it is the healthiest you'll get as far as no additives, really pure. I think tequila, out of all the liquors, is probably the cleanest, out of all of them, including vodka.

[00:58:58.710] - Speaker 2
It doesn't have sugar in it like- No sugar.

[00:59:01.030] - Speaker 1
It's a total different buzz. But again, with my age comes moderation. So I've figured that out, too. But we got a tequila company called El Bandido. The name came from Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kids when they were the Bolivian police come running in there. El Bandido It's not a Metacana, whatever. So Albendido Yankee, actually, is what we called it from that movie. And it's going good. We're about 15, 16 states, and it's here in Malibu.

[00:59:24.720] - Speaker 2
Where can you get it?

[00:59:25.580] - Speaker 1
Any distributor in California, you just tell them or any bar or restaurant you go to, they can order it. They'll just order it through the distributor. Like I said, if you're a tequila person, you'll know this is a clean, good tequila. It's been fun. A lot of great trips, a lot of events. We got NASCAR in Chicago coming up and brings you to a lot of new places. And then I'm still doing the Chicago Blackhawks ambassador job, which is cool. You just go to games and shake hands, sit in a suite, take pictures. At least you feel a little bit relevant. You're still around the game. Started doing ESPN last year with Mark Messier. Was that fun? You know what? It's great to get back in the game. I don't like the grind of traveling. I only do 45 games a year with the ESPN and all playouts, which is cool because the playouts is where it gets really exciting. So I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be an unbelievable playoff this But it's been good. I can't say I'm as comfortable as I want to be on TV. I didn't go to school like my daughter's doing it.

[01:00:22.470] - Speaker 1
And you could tell the five years of journalism was paying off with her because she sounds so good and smooth. And for a woman, what a great opportunity it's been for her, but she worked hard to earn it. It's fun to do a couple of games with her. They've allowed me to do that. I don't think I've ever seen a father-daughter tandem. You could tell that we're both alike, so it's comical. Then the last thing is I do a little deal with Wayne Gretszky where Bet MGM Ambassadors, and that's just a small job. But again, it brings you to some cool things, meet some cool people. I don't golf, but some of the tournaments, you get to meet some pretty interesting people and go to some pretty cool places. But like you, you stay busy. Always. It's hard not to. Wildman told me I was going to retire at 50, Don Wildman. He goes, no, wait until you're 60. And now I'm thinking, Well, Don was 80. He wasn't quite retired. So now I'm shooting for indeed. But it's fun staying busy. I love coming back to Malibu to see friends. It's great that I got a chance to run into you.

[01:01:23.630] - Speaker 1
So cool. Because we're really never in the same city or country half the time.

[01:01:28.300] - Speaker 2
You seem to know a lot of musicians. How did that come to be?

[01:01:31.270] - Speaker 1
Playing hockey as long as I did all the years, you just see all the venues, I guess. We shared the same venues, first of all. I can get in any backstage. I don't need any passes to get in where I'm playing. In the Chicago I could have run for mayor at some point. Montreal, same thing. You have that advantage. I'll drop one named, and I'm not going to say where he is because I don't know if I'm allowed to, but I've been really good friends with Eddie Vetter, and I met him through Dennis Rodman because he was a Bulls fan at the time, not a hockey fan. We met in '95 and become really close friends. It's crazy how quick that time goes. I've seen him get married and have a couple of kids, but we're totally opposite. But for some reason, we have this weird connection. I'll go to his beach house, and he has the same pineapple thing on his wall, and then he'll have a T-shirt that I have. I'm thinking he might have stolen my T-shirt or something. But it's crazy how we have these similar, I wouldn't call them dumb things, but he He's such an intellectual.

[01:02:31.520] - Speaker 1
He showed me so much stuff over the years, and it's a great relationship. I guess you could say opposites attract, but through him, I've gotten to see some of the most unbelievable, historic things in music, and I've learned to appreciate music more. I love music. I'm just not real knowledgeable about it. I think I told you earlier, I know a lot more about hockey than Eddie does or music than he knows about hockey. So it evens out the platform. But that's it. Then we have a mutual friend in Kid Rock when I was in Detroit. If there's anything going on, Bobby was in the middle of it. He's another guy, interesting and all over the place. But I loved it, and I loved being around that In my life, I think I tried playing an instrument, five different instruments when I was a kid. It was clarinet, coronet, saxophone, trumpets type like that, and piano. After all of them, I realized I'm not good at any of them. I better start learning how to play a or do something else. But in my next life, I would have loved to be a musician. It never worked out.

[01:03:34.500] - Speaker 1
But Johnny Mac, we started a band during COVID, and I got to play the keyboards, and it was a blast until him and Timmy kicked me out. I've been kicked out three times now. I don't know if I want to be around these music guys because it's crazy, the temperamental and how all their issues are falling out. So we don't have that in hockey. Once you're a teammate, you're blood brothers. This whole rock and roll thing- There's a question about that.

[01:03:58.050] - Speaker 2
If there's a guy who's on an enemy me team. It's like the Dennis Rodman question, and then they get traded to your team, what happens?

[01:04:06.420] - Speaker 1
I was that guy. I got traded from Chicago to Detroit, and all of Detroit hated me. And I mean, it couldn't have been worse. And then when I went to Detroit, all the fans in Chicago turned on him, and that was hometown. But the minute I walked in the room, the first guy came up to me, this guy I had issues with for a long time. His name is Marty Lapoint. He comes up to me. He goes, Are we going to be okay? I just, We better be. We're teammates, man. So it It's crazy. Yeah, you're adopted. And that's happened to a lot of guys over the course of the years. And I put on that, where I'd bring his jersey the first time. I literally almost start crying how wrong it looked. But you just start playing, and thank God How did we started winning. If I was to start losing, I would have been disowned in Chicago, and the Detroit would have kicked me out, and I would have been homeless. So it is a strange feeling, Rick. Trust me. But again, once you're on the team, everything's forgiven. And that's the beauty of it.

[01:05:01.470] - Speaker 1
But getting back to these musicians, they don't forgive. How many of these guys, even family guys, split up? Maybe because they spend so much time together, eight hours in studios, or I don't know. It's like a marriage with these guys, and all of a sudden, it's like a divorce.

[01:05:14.280] - Speaker 2
It is like a marriage. And it's also very emotional and personal. It's not just physical. It's like there's a whole mental aspect of working stuff out much closer to a romantic relationship than it is to playing a game together.

[01:05:29.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah, we can get it all physically. We just go out and run someone over on the ice. You guys got to keep that. The only way they get it out is singing through songs, right? Basically, they come up with great songs about real-life things. That's cool.

[01:05:40.660] - Speaker 2
You see the great bands usually have that tension, like Jagger & Richards, tension. John and Paul, tension. It's like it seems to be a regular thing. Joe Perry and Steven Tyler, tension. So always the thing that makes the band good is that two people see it differently. Where they bridge the gap, that's this special thing where it's not just this guy's stuff, and it's not just this guy's stuff. It's where they intersect, and they don't belong intersected because they don't like each other. They see it different. That's where the magic lies often in advance.

[01:06:18.470] - Speaker 1
I've never heard that. Yeah, I've never heard that. But you would know a better interview. You're not the horse whisperer, you're the band whisperer. It's amazing. Your reputation with them. And you have such as ho-hum, laxed days attitude, which that's your thing. And that vibe carries to them. And I think you have a calming effect on a lot of people that go through that. And the ability to put these people in your studio. And I was fortunate enough the other day for the first time in 25 years, I don't know why I never came or I thought this was your church. It is your church. It's off limits for everything because of how special and the history behind it. But man, was that lucky to walk through there? And you just feel the ghosts of all of the people that have been in there. I love that type of feeling.

[01:07:05.030] - Speaker 2
Yeah, me too. It's such a cool place. There's a reason. One of the things that I found is a thing that allows people to relax is the fact that there's nobody around. There's no one to perform for. There's no audience. Because even sometimes one person, or if let's say it's a band of four people and one person's girlfriend is in the studio, it changes the the whole energy of how everyone is acting, or if two friends come to meet somebody while we're working, it changes it. It changes this feeling of there's nobody else. There's no outside world. We're not performing for anyone else, and it can get really personal and really intimate. That's what we aim for.

[01:07:50.760] - Speaker 1
I'm not a late-night guy, but I'm not going to say when it happened. But when I was here at your studio, we're watching videos of the band.

[01:07:58.920] - Speaker 2
Incredible.

[01:07:59.990] - Speaker 1
And Eddie grabs a guitar, and it's the same guitar this guy's playing in 1970, whenever. That gives you goosebumps. For me, that's like when I went to Graceland, just knowing that Elvis was here and there and there. For me, I love that part of the mystique. But this was real special, not knowing what to expect. Then everybody pointing out, like Eddie pointing out in the background, that's the picnic table right there that they're sitting at, and that's the ovens.

[01:08:26.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and that's the pool table that they played on in the movie.

[01:08:29.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah, That's so cool. When I'm trying to connect everything. I go, Man, that wallpaper, that's not the same wallpaper.

[01:08:34.300] - Speaker 2
We remodeled.

[01:08:36.280] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it's so cool. I'm glad I got a chance to see it.

[01:08:39.850] - Speaker 2
Cool, man. Well, thank you so much for coming. No, thank you. I love seeing you. It's great that we got to hang out a little bit.

[01:08:44.160] - Speaker 1
You, too, Rick. Yeah.
