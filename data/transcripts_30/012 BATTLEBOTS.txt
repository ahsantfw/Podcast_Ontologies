[00:00:07.840] - Speaker 2
Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:10.470] - Speaker 1
Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton. Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:18.450] - Speaker 2
Tetragrammaton.

[00:00:22.320] - Speaker 1
Okay, so how far back should we go?

[00:00:25.640] - Speaker 3
Go to the beginning. First of all, before Battlebots, the history of robot fighting. Sure.

[00:00:33.440] - Speaker 1
There's always these people out there, engineers, tinkers, special effects people, who get a thrill out of building something only to destroy it spectacularly. Our friend, training our friends, and even ourselves, we would build models, plastic models that you'd see back in the day at the Five and Dime store. You'd build it, you'd painstakingly paint it, put all decals on really perfectly. Then you'd be like, Okay, well, that was great. Let's go burn it up right in the backyard, or blow it up with fire crackers. You'd find more and more spectacular ways of destroying it, which was almost as thrilling as building it, maybe even a little more thrilling.

[00:01:13.770] - Speaker 3
Will this include things like SDs Rockets?

[00:01:16.060] - Speaker 1
Absolutely. It's like you're not satisfied with the model, with the SDs rocket. Trey had Cox Boat in the...

[00:01:23.520] - Speaker 2
Yeah, and the airplanes. I mean, our Rockets, our SD Rockets, we'd put multiple engines in, as many as you can. Until it didn't fly right or it'd be so heavy or they'd ignite, you'd never see the thing again. You never know where it went and kept going.

[00:01:37.240] - Speaker 1
Or you put cameras on it. Or you just try to hack it in some way to get a more exciting experience than just what the company wants you to do.

[00:01:46.590] - Speaker 3
This is happening in Northern California, correct?

[00:01:48.780] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, Trey was in Taluka Lake. We're cousins, first of all. Our two moms put us together as the boys. We had a third cousin, Gar, who we were the terrible trio, and they'd always put us together. It was between Northern California, Marine County, to Luka Lake, LA, and where Gar lived, which was like Saratoga or something. Anyway. But there's these, not just Trey and I, but there's all kinds of people like this. As things develop, these little pockets of fighting happen. We heard about in Denver, there's this thing called the Critter Crunch, where people smashed remote remote control cars together. In Atlanta, there was this thing called Robo Battles, where they would do robot-type fighting, but more with remote control vehicles. In Japan, there was the sumo robots, where they build little teeny robots, and they have them in a circle and they smash into them and try to push them out of the circle, sumo, basically. Our group was surrounding with special effects people, young kids who would eventually become special effects people for George Lucas, guys like Mark Satrakian and Peter Abramson, and We were just blowing stuff up and having a good time.

[00:03:02.170] - Speaker 1
We were inspired by dangerous toys on David Letterman.

[00:03:06.310] - Speaker 3
Did you guys ever see Survival Research?

[00:03:08.500] - Speaker 1
We were totally inspired by Mark Pauline and Survival Research.

[00:03:10.930] - Speaker 3
I was really into Mark Pauline. As a matter of fact, I think we at American, we even distributed some of his VHSs at one point. Again, just trying to spread the word because it was so cool.

[00:03:20.900] - Speaker 1
We would sneak into his shows, and they'd always get shot down by the police, but those were fun.

[00:03:28.650] - Speaker 3
I've never been to one of his live I met him, and I've been to his place in San Francisco, I don't know, 30-some-odd years ago. Dog patch, right.

[00:03:35.700] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:03:36.150] - Speaker 3
But tell me about the experience of going to see a survival research lab show. It seemed really dangerous.

[00:03:43.810] - Speaker 2
Scary dangerous. It was dumb dangerous. People were probably leaving their death because he'd fire up a jet engine and then people can't hear it be so loud. He'd drive things around. I mean, part of his thing was scaring the crap out of me.

[00:03:59.710] - Speaker 3
It was definitely It was confrontational.

[00:04:02.020] - Speaker 2
People could have gotten hurt in a lot of... Remember, he did the explosion thing and all the pigeons.

[00:04:06.360] - Speaker 1
Yeah, he stacks up all these old, upright pianos onto the pylon that's holding up the freeway in San Francisco. It's literally almost nearly all the way up. There's probably like, I might be exaggerating, but it seemed to my vision at the time, like 40 freaking pianos all the way up this thing. Then some bomb goes off. I don't know what it was inside the piano.

[00:04:29.110] - Speaker 2
There's flame pigeon after pigeon. On either side of the freeway. People driving down the freeway must have gotten paranoid because there's literally flames probably going up. Up and around the overpass. 30, 40 feet.

[00:04:38.750] - Speaker 1
But that caused probably the pigeon population of San Francisco that was living under that overpass to just die instantly and fall down to the ground. It was horrific. I remember he also had the Sonic Cannons that would just blast the audience. It was a settling, and it would shoot that airway wave at you. It was pointed right at me, and I'm like, boom.

[00:05:05.250] - Speaker 3
You're trying to watch a show while having cannons of air blasted at you in deafening.

[00:05:10.810] - Speaker 1
Then there's this cornucopia full of probably just horrible stuff from the fish market that this other robot would attack, and at a certain point, it's going to fall on the audience.

[00:05:22.160] - Speaker 3
It's just horrible, smelly, rotten fish.

[00:05:24.950] - Speaker 1
Probably, yes. Yeah. Those were quite fun.

[00:05:28.340] - Speaker 3
That's unbelievable. I remember he also had like real animal carcasses on the robots. It was just a wild bombastic show. He had like a- Very punk rock.

[00:05:40.580] - Speaker 1
A super punk rock and fantastic. But you take all that soupCoupe. Right. And then the real spark is this guy named Mark Thorpe, who worked for George Lucas, was an artist, did all the special effects stuff in the Star Wars era, and also did licensing. And he comes up with this idea. He He buys a tank, one of these giant remote control tanks that used to be in the thrifties or whatever right back in the day, just to build it for fun. As the origin story goes, he, It's a tank. Okay, great. I built it. It's remote control. Puts a vacuum cleaner on it. Okay, I can vacuum my house. That's cool. It's boring. Puts a chainsaw on it, and the light bulb goes off and says, Aha, I know what to do with this. I can start. I mean, almost like I can start a sport where my like-minded friends can build other cool stuff weapons on them, remote control, and we can all fight each other. I'm going to make a set of rules, and I'm going to tell Wired magazine how cool this is, and I'm going to raise some money. And guess who he raised the money from?

[00:06:41.450] - Speaker 2
Steve Plotnicki.

[00:06:42.220] - Speaker 3
Wow. Amazing. Yes.

[00:06:44.370] - Speaker 1
Amazing. That begat Robot Wars.

[00:06:47.490] - Speaker 3
So Robot Wars was the first iteration of a...

[00:06:51.250] - Speaker 1
Of a robot fighting... Of a federation, we'll call it. Yeah, like a Robot Fighting League federation. But where the sport really came to be. Do you think of it as a sport? Yeah, absolutely. It's interesting. That's where it came to be, was Robot Wars, 1994 in San Francisco.

[00:07:07.540] - Speaker 3
1994 in San Francisco.

[00:07:10.020] - Speaker 2
It's more a sport than the video game playing and all that. For sure. It's more a sport than probably quite a few things labeled sports out there. If you use sports. It's sport of the brain. That's what we call it. But you're physically building it. You're getting hurt, cutting things, if not yourself. So, yeah, it's a sport of the brain. That's what we call it. It'sport.

[00:07:30.580] - Speaker 3
And okay, so now that's 1994, and now how does Battlebots come in to be?

[00:07:36.140] - Speaker 2
So Mark Thorpe invites Mark Streckian, who builds one of the first robots for 1994 and builds the master. And there was 18 robots, I think that year or something.

[00:07:46.130] - Speaker 1
Something like 18 robots.

[00:07:47.620] - Speaker 2
And so Greg immediately gets called by Mark's track and saying, Hey, you got to come check this out. I need help pushing my robot in and doing working on it and everything else. Greg goes to it and he calls me up right afterwards and says, Hey, you got to come do this. We got to build a robot. For 1995, we built a robot. Our robot was called La Machine, and we were pretty much undefeated for two years. Wow, cool. It was a stupid wedge robot, but it worked very well. It was fast.

[00:08:18.440] - Speaker 3
You call it a wedge. Describe the different styles of robots in terms of the main styles of robots. The wedge is one of the main styles. What are the other styles?

[00:08:30.420] - Speaker 2
There are spinners, hammers, grapplers.

[00:08:34.690] - Speaker 1
It's really like nowadays, like a wedge is almost like the base.

[00:08:39.490] - Speaker 3
You build on top of the wedge.

[00:08:41.990] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and almost everyone starts with a wedge nowadays. Back in the day, you didn't have to have... At old Robot Wars, you didn't have to have what's called an active weapon. You could just come with a wedge and plow into people and wedge them into the corners and win a fight by pinning them. Mark Thorpe, and that's what Trane and I built, law machine with the help of this great engineer named Gage Koshua, who's a whole nother story. We won that thing, but Mark was terrified because he's developing this budding sport, and he doesn't want it to get too boring because a wedge can be boring. So quickly this concept of active weapons emerged, where on top of the wedge, you got to have something that does something mechanical. You can't electrocute the other robots, you can't do an EMP, you can't throw- That's interesting, though. Yeah, but that would be such a fast fight. I The first time, it would be great. Second time, be like, he just pushed a button.

[00:09:33.740] - Speaker 3
When did fire come into the picture?

[00:09:35.630] - Speaker 1
As soon as possible. As soon as the fire marshal would allow it.

[00:09:40.120] - Speaker 3
Because some of them seem to spit fire. It doesn't seem to have much effect on the other robots, but it does add to the show.

[00:09:49.030] - Speaker 1
It's a psychological game, right? So if my robot spits fire, your robot, you just have a visceral reaction to fire. Primal, right? It's like, oh, crap. And you might lose a of control when you're controlling your robot by proxy on the remote.

[00:10:04.050] - Speaker 3
Let's talk about that because that's a key. When I've watched it, I don't really think so much about the controllers. I'm thinking about the robots. It's almost like the robots are alive and fighting. But somebody is controlling it. And I imagine the better you are controlling it, the better your robot is going to do.

[00:10:21.220] - Speaker 1
Well, so Trey is probably one of the best controllers out there because he's a helicopter pilot.

[00:10:26.260] - Speaker 2
Yeah, driving it is a part of a secret. So The LaMachine, the very first version of it, we had no speed controller, so it was light switches. We just hooked a car battery up, gage his car battery out of his Honda Civic. We'd pull out, stick it in the robot, drive it for five minutes, and pull it back out, hopefully before it died, start the car and let that charge it. It didn't have a charger either. But we had light switches, on/off switches. We'd send all that current from the 12-volt battery into these little starter motors. That's what drove the robot. It was very difficult to drive. However, figured it out pretty well, pretty quickly and got a few wins.

[00:11:02.700] - Speaker 3
In the early days, were there rules of what you could and couldn't do? Oh, yeah. What are the rules? What are you allowed to do? And how big can it be? And how much can it weigh? And has it changed?

[00:11:13.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah. In the Robot Wars early days, it was four weight classes from 30-ish, I forget the exact numbers, all the way probably to the heavies were, probably just under 100. Then when we came up with the... When we evolved the concept of Battlebots, we first start up with lights, probably in the 60-ish, to super heavies, which got up to 350. Then at a certain point, when we rebooted the show in 2015, we discovered, you know what? One weight class is the way to go for a TV show because it's one arc of one champion on the road to winning the giant nut instead of four. In the Comedy Central version of the show that was on in the '90s, there was four arcs. It was hard to follow. It was a bit like a three-wing circus. The ABC version of the show, we just went down to one, which is now 250 pounds, which seems to be a real sweet spot for size and girth and smacking into someone really hard and being awesome, but not too difficult for a team of five to six, seven people to field.

[00:12:11.370] - Speaker 3
Does the TV aspect of it follow the sport? In other words, does the sport come first and now it's on television, or is it a TV show that has a sport attached to it?

[00:12:24.580] - Speaker 1
It depends on who you talk to.

[00:12:26.550] - Speaker 3
Well, I'm talking to you guys.

[00:12:27.920] - Speaker 1
If you talk to us, it's absolutely sport. Sport first. Sport first. Yeah, 100 %. We have rules. We enforce those rules, and the TV cameras are there to capture what happens in the tournament. Is there a little bit of TV fun, reality show fun? You're making TV? Absolutely. But in the something like the Bachelor on a scale of 1 to 10 is a manipulation factor of nine. Yes. Battle Botz is like two, if even that. I mean, what you're seeing on TV is what really happened.

[00:12:57.880] - Speaker 3
Even something like American Ninja Warriors it would be primarily a TV show. I don't know that that idea existed before the TV show or did it.

[00:13:06.450] - Speaker 1
Do you know? I think that was a Japanese competition. I don't know if it was a TV show in Japan first or just a competition, but that's very good parallel to battle bots because those are real athletes who really want to do that obstacle course and get to the next level, next level, next level. Our builders are real engineers. They're not handpicked or casted or anything that stuff. It's the best, the best. Build the bot and the fights are real. Boxes, lock, lights are on this robot fight in time. Go, you fight and we see who wins. There's no manipulation. We get such stuff from the audience because they're so used to reality shows and they're so used to- Yeah, everything's fake. Cribs, everything is fake. And they think, your judges are fake. But no, it's all 100 %. That's great.

[00:13:53.450] - Speaker 3
We'll get into the specifics of it, but you mentioned there was a time that it was on Comedy Central years ago, and then it rebooted years later on ABC. In that window, when there was no TV, was it still happening?

[00:14:07.350] - Speaker 1
Absolutely.

[00:14:07.930] - Speaker 3
Yeah. So the TV is a way to see it if you don't happen to be at the arena, but the arena is rocking.

[00:14:14.930] - Speaker 1
It's always happening.

[00:14:15.800] - Speaker 2
I didn't think that the TV was that important at the beginning until we went off the air for a while, and then I realized how important the TV was. I equate it to Little League and Pro Baseball. You can't have Little League unless you have Pro Baseball, but you can't have of baseball unless you have Little League. They need each other.

[00:14:33.160] - Speaker 3
So the TV allows enough people to see it that they get interested and want to participate. It's like advertising, essentially.

[00:14:41.220] - Speaker 2
And it makes heroes out of engineers. It makes heroes out of marketing people. Which is really interesting. Which we don't do today.

[00:14:46.760] - Speaker 3
What's the relationship between... It's interesting that this started in Northern California. That's our tech hub. Do you see a relationship between this and the tech world in Northern California?

[00:14:57.830] - Speaker 1
Yes and no. I mean, a big The majority of our teams come from California, but not so much the startup culture as it is the engineering-making culture and the special effects culture in Los Angeles. We got a lot of teams from the ILMs of the world and whatever was going on, the myriad of companies in Southern California. Then we get a lot from Florida because that's where we didn't... You mentioned the offseason when we weren't on Comedy Central anymore and about to get on ABC. We started a nonprofit for kids to fight robots in the high schools and colleges. So cool. That begat a lot of kids in Florida doing it. But it's all just engineering students who think it's awesome. And just anybody who's into that making culture, right?

[00:15:43.760] - Speaker 3
It's the same, what would have been the hobbyists who might have been into building a ham radio? Exactly. Or the people who would go to Radio Shack to buy parts to build some cool electronic something.

[00:15:55.460] - Speaker 1
Exactly right. There's just a lot of those in California because that's where That is one of those ground zeros, one of those epicenters.

[00:16:02.700] - Speaker 3
Also, if you've seen, what's it called? Any Given Sunday, it's another tangent. It's the motorcycle version of it, but it's still like young people interested in the in that case, racing, putting together their own hot rod bikes. It's another do it yourself competitive culture.

[00:16:23.420] - Speaker 1
It's very much like hot rod culture, RC planes, those folks who go out on the weekends and fly all over the place and modded there. It's these weird subcultures. This one just happened to pop because it's so strange. Like Trey mentioned, that first 1994 Robot Wars, Mark D. Pages me and says, You got to check this Yeah, so cool. You go into the building and you're like, it smells different. Then there was this big wall of bleachers in front of me. I couldn't see what was going on. I walked around the corner and I finally see what's happening from all this cacophony of heard noises that are different than most of the noises you hear day to day. It sounds like a car accident going on again and again and again and again. I see this wooden box fighting this phallic, giant saw thing which was the master. It's an experience you've never experienced before, even in the movies. The first time everyone sees Star Wars, they say, Oh, that was a singular experience. Seeing that Robot Wars in '94 was just like I think that's why people get into it and groove on it.

[00:17:32.600] - Speaker 1
That's why the culture is starting to grow worldwide, and people are doing it.

[00:17:36.290] - Speaker 3
It seems like as the culture becomes more and more virtual, the idea of being able to physically see something, it's a very different experience seeing something in person instead of seeing the virtual version of it. It's a very different experience building something where you get to see how gravity works and how all of the forces at play in the real world affect it And I imagine if you do get good at that, it would even benefit you in doing virtual design because you have a better understanding of the real forces at play.

[00:18:11.660] - Speaker 1
100 %. So that's why it's such a valuable thing to get into, especially as a kid, because by building it for real and breaking it for real, you understand how to... You, first of all, have to be really resourceful to get it to work again, which is a great skill to have. And you figure out how stuff, what forces, what the real forces are like and how powerful they can be. We've had guys who built these private rocket ships, like SpaceX things. They They're the Battlebots people because they know how stuff breaks, which is pretty exciting. Super cool. Yeah.

[00:18:51.410] - Speaker 2
The violence of it is a hell of a hook. There's something in us that wants violence. Why else would people watch fake wrestling? Why else would people watch boxing to a certain extent? What's there? What's in it for us?

[00:19:04.750] - Speaker 3
You think it's a hardwired thing? I think it's a hardwired thing. Do you think it's violence or do you think it's just competition?

[00:19:09.850] - Speaker 2
I think it's violence. I think it's the destruction. The competition is there, too. But I think it comes from the hunt, is my guess. We had to hunt to survive. We had to get food to whatever. Somehow I got a new puppy, and the puppy has never been around anything else. Its mom has never nested, and it starts nesting in the couch, starts digging and trying to a little hole to get us up. It's like, where did that come from? Oh, it came from some past instinct where they had to dig a hole to stay warm for the night. Yes, I think that's in us. We want that violence. However, why do people watch car races sometimes for the crash? But then you feel terrible. When the crash happens, you almost feel guilty like you wished for it. Then when the guy gets out, you go, Oh, it's okay. If he gets out or hopefully he gets out. Battlebot seems to bring that violence to you without any guilt, which is really cool. It's something everyone can enjoy.

[00:20:03.250] - Speaker 3
I watch pro wrestling, and that's the reason I do. I like that there are two people working together to put on the best show that they can, and it's very difficult what they're doing, and they can get hurt for real, but they're not trying to hurt each other. They're actually trying to protect each other. Interesting, and you get to see a story. I like that better than boxing, where it looks like people are actually trying to hurt each other, and it just makes me less comfortable.

[00:20:28.650] - Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly.

[00:20:29.840] - Speaker 1
Exactly. There's so many sports where human, like football, getting concussions and all this stuff. But you can get the thrill, that visceral, whatever it is, thrill we get, like Trey said. I think it's that hunt feel from these robots, but it's completely guilt-free. It's by proxy.

[00:20:48.070] - Speaker 3
I just talked to Jason Blum, who makes horror movies, and he was saying he thinks it's the way to get that excitement without the actual threat. It's like from the comfort of your own home or sitting in a movie theater, you can feel like what these life and death situations are like.

[00:21:08.480] - Speaker 1
Exactly, yeah. Peter Gabriel said this. He wanted to make that amusement park back in the day he was talking about. You could get these intense experiences, like almost dying or this and this and this. But you're safe.

[00:21:18.310] - Speaker 3
But in a safe situation. Yeah.

[00:21:20.300] - Speaker 1
You come out of that experience being more, hopefully a better person.

[00:21:26.550] - Speaker 3
Would you say it's continually grown over the years? Yeah, for sure. Is it bigger now than it's ever been?

[00:21:31.170] - Speaker 2
There's no end to what people can think up and build. There is an end to how fast something can go, maybe. There's an end to what you can... I mean, the cars are getting faster and all this stuff, so they keep getting better. But there is some limit at some point where these robots, there's no end to what people can think of new ideas and perfecting existing ideas. I think it's at its beginning, to be honest with you. Yeah, totally. I think it's got a long way to go. Every year we get submissions from new robots that we look at the images and we go, Oh, how's that going to work? Well, we got to see. Tantrum was a robot that was new three, four years ago, brand new. We looked at this brand new design and we thought, Is that really going to work, whatever. We'll check it out. First year, he came, didn't do so well. Came back the second year and dialed it in, did a lot better. And then third year, he came, he won. It was the same robot with just tweaked.Perfected. Yeah.

[00:22:29.500] - Speaker 3
Learning from the mistakes.

[00:22:31.000] - Speaker 2
Learning from his mistakes and making it better.

[00:22:32.270] - Speaker 1
There's little league popping up all over the place. I mean, literally worldwide. Really? Battlebots is like, think of it as the Super Bowl and as the major league with the 250-pound heavyweights. But kids are building one-pound fighting robots in much smaller arenas, and that's happening all over the planet.

[00:22:51.700] - Speaker 3
Is there a website or a place to see all those different?

[00:22:55.290] - Speaker 1
Go to robotcombat events. Com. Great. You might find something in your backyard.

[00:23:01.420] - Speaker 3
So cool.

[00:23:02.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah, because we get hit up all the time. How do I do it? My kid loves it. My kid can't stop watching your show. How does he or she get into it? That's the place to start, is find a local event, build something really small because it's a lot safer and a lot easier and a lot less expensive. Go and meet some of the people who are in the community who hopefully live next door to you. Go to one of those local events. From there, it'll be the world when it will take you up if you're really passionate about it, and you'll work your way up to the 30 pounds, the other pounds, and then maybe one day get on the TV show. So cool.

[00:23:35.910] - Speaker 3
It's so cool. It's funny. I have a six-year-old son, and he's obsessed with battle bots. I remember after we watched it the first time, maybe a year or so ago, we watched it, and he's very addicted to it. He said, Let's get the Battlebot toys. I said, I have a feeling there aren't going to be any Battlebot toys. This is really underground subculture. He's like, No, I have a feeling if we go to Amazon, we're going to find Battlebot toys. And we went to Amazon, and there were Battlebot toys, and they're great. They're great. I just left the house. He was playing with his Battlebot remote control toys right now.

[00:24:10.290] - Speaker 1
So we've been friends with the Hex bugs folks forever. When Trey and I started the nonprofit, We got booted from Comedy Central after five seasons, like TV shows always happen, right? We started up the nonprofit. The problem back then was everyone's on these radio frequencies, literal FM radio, and you can step on someone's frequency. If my radio is controlling your robot's frequency, that's a serious, deadly situation. You have to do radio impounds, and you have to do all this crazy stuff. Digital technology slowly started to take hold. But in that middle phase, this company called IFI created a system where you could be on independent frequencies, and it was a lot safer. We forced all the high school kids to use their system. Those are the guys, two guys who started Hex bugs. We had an in with them. When we got the deal. When we got the reboot happening with ABC, we said, ABC, you got to coax up with the toy deal. Go do it, go do it. And they did. Then eventually, we got the deal ourselves, and the rest is history in terms of what you can buy at Target.

[00:25:14.400] - Speaker 3
Tell me, why did Comedy Central... I understand shows get dropped all the time. Were the numbers not good?

[00:25:21.330] - Speaker 2
Comedy Central was sold. That was the biggest reason. I see. So they were sold to MTV. I see. Mtv had a deal with Robot Wars. I see. So that was part of the issue.

[00:25:30.410] - Speaker 3
So Robot Wars was still going on in the UK- In the UK. Based on the deal that you guys set up? Yeah. Amazing. And it still goes till today as well? No.

[00:25:38.350] - Speaker 2
It stopped.

[00:25:39.840] - Speaker 1
Yeah, it stopped. It had a reboot as well, but didn't catch hold like our reboot did, unfortunately.

[00:25:45.490] - Speaker 3
Okay, so you start your company. What year did you guys start? '99? We started '99, exactly. '99. And Comedy Central for five years?

[00:25:55.280] - Speaker 1
No, five seasons. It was really over two and a half years. Because we did two big seasons per year. I I see. Trey's right. It was a lot of that behind-the-scenes stuff going on. But also, I think our fault for getting canceled back then was we allowed the robots to get a little boring. Our rule set allowed for it, I should say. I see.

[00:26:14.810] - Speaker 3
Was Comedy Central the right home for bottle bots?

[00:26:19.610] - Speaker 1
We debated that back before.

[00:26:20.410] - Speaker 3
Because that's another question.

[00:26:21.820] - Speaker 2
It wasn't the right show. I mean, comedy in our show needs to be there. I wish there was more today, to be honest with you. Totally. That element, there was a little bit of fun making of the participants. That was not the right way to do it. They were the only network that took us. We went knocked in every door, and they all laughed at us. Of course. Comedy Central laughed and said, Hey, maybe we can make a funny show out of this. It It's a starting point, if not anything else, you can't knock it.

[00:26:48.110] - Speaker 3
Then after the Comedy Central deal ends, there was no takers after that for a period of time?

[00:26:54.250] - Speaker 1
Well, so the robots maybe got a little too boring. For whatever reason, then they moved us to Well, that classic story. Ratings go down, whether that was manipulated or not, who knows. We were on a hunt for about 12 years to find a new network. We hooked up with the guy who executive-produced American Idol. We hooked up with Fox Television Studios. We even hooked up with Mark Burnet and James Cameron. They partnered on rebooting Battlebots for Discovery.

[00:27:26.760] - Speaker 2
We introduced them to each other. We've never met each other. Amazing.

[00:27:29.990] - Speaker 1
That show got green-lit in the room, but quickly became a budgetary insane avalanche.

[00:27:36.180] - Speaker 2
Their name's attached.

[00:27:37.400] - Speaker 1
Because it's got James Cameron attached to it. He's talking about, We can do flying robots with sworms, and they can shoot flame balls at each other. And Trina are like, You could do that, but that's going to cost a lot of money. And it's not going to be a good TV.

[00:27:49.820] - Speaker 3
I think part of the beauty of this is the do it yourself, home-made aspect of the whole thing.

[00:27:57.590] - Speaker 1
Which is the beautiful thing. We're getting depressed, right? We're doing this nonprofit for kids. It's working out okay. But the show is not catching hold. And we're getting a lot of like, yeah, we'll do it, and then it doesn't happen. Yeah, we'll do it, and it doesn't happen.

[00:28:10.960] - Speaker 2
The deals weren't right either. We could have given it away. Yeah, I understand. We weren't going to do that. We weren't going to let them take advantage of the participants, which was a Robot Wars issue. The Robot Wars took advantage of the participants, the Robot Wars. If you saw any of the old Robot Wars, it was the house robots were what they made, right? The house robots always won. The house robots are what they made toys out of. They were never going to share anything. Part of our deal is to share everything with the participants. If we use them, they get a percentage of the toy deals. They get part of everything. We started as participants. We're going to always look at everything as a contest's point of view and make them as happy as what we would have wanted if we were on their side.

[00:28:52.800] - Speaker 3
That's great.

[00:28:54.100] - Speaker 1
But we're friends with the myth Buster guys, Jamie and Adam, right? They start doing this podcast that's called Tested. That is managed or owned by a company called Whale Rock. Trey sees Jamie from Myth Busters at one of these press upfronts where we're going to announce that James Cameron and Mark Burnet are going to... And they wanted to change our name, which really pissed me off. They would change it to Robogeddon. We had spent years building a Battlebot's brand, and they want to change it. So right then, I thought, no, this is probably not going to happen. But anyway, Jamie says, you got to hook up with this company I'm with called Whale Rock. We met with the head of TV there, Chris Cauen, who was probably... I mean, we love all these network execs who tried to help us get the TV show, but Chris was super smart, really great, and was on the same page as us. We want to make this into a bona fide sport where the builders are the heroes. We don't manipulate anything. He's a huge sports fan. He just wants to take that model and apply it to robot fighting sports.

[00:29:54.190] - Speaker 1
We're like, Okay, this guy's pretty cool. Let's do it. We hooked up a deal. Because that production company Because it was owned by, what's that guy? Lloyd Braun. Lloyd Braun, yeah. He's the huge ERP from- ABC. Abc, who launched Lost and Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy. I mean, they're huge shows. We walked in the room and pretty much got a green light almost instantly. Trey and I were like, We never thought we'd make broadcast. It's wild. We're cable, right? Yeah.

[00:30:23.800] - Speaker 2
And we got- ABC wasn't the right hope.

[00:30:26.000] - Speaker 3
Good cable.

[00:30:27.280] - Speaker 1
Right. So then we got ABC. But we only lasted basically two seasons there, really a season and a half, if you really think about it.

[00:30:34.810] - Speaker 3
And then what happened?

[00:30:35.960] - Speaker 1
We got so screwed over by the Hillary Trump election because the show got preempted twice because of their acceptance speeches from the conventions. There was some mass shooting where Obama had to get on and preempt the show, which is horrible, obviously. And then the Olympics, which put us off air for whatever that was, three weeks. So we had viewership going up and down, up and down, up and down. You can tell that story to network execs, but they just want to see the number be consistent for the advertising.

[00:31:06.260] - Speaker 3
But it's impossible.

[00:31:07.760] - Speaker 1
Yeah. So we're-No win-no-win situation.

[00:31:10.880] - Speaker 2
We were their only show that was 50/50. They're a female work, and they would get the male and the female demographic, and they were very impressed with that. But they only air things once. For us, the best is to air it as many times as possible for all the ancillary reasons and everything else. So Technically, they weren't really our right home for us.

[00:31:33.140] - Speaker 1
But we discovered something cool is that, yeah, ABC is probably primarily a female demographic these days because the show is like the Bachelor and all this stuff. Back then it was, right? But we learned that our family numbers, they call it co-viewing, was really, really good. That meant families really like this show, which is a valuable, which could be a valuable thing for another network. But anyway, we got lucky because ABC is trying to make a return on their investment into the show, and they start selling it, which is what they do. They sold it to Discovery Science. Interesting. And they got the highest ratings they've ever gotten in three years. Wow. Yeah. From a repeat of a bot show on another network. Wow. We made a deal with Discovery Science, which turned into a deal with Discovery. Great. Here, we've been there for five seasons now.

[00:32:25.190] - Speaker 3
It sounds like, of all the stories you've told, that sounds like the closest to a right home that you found thus far?

[00:32:31.650] - Speaker 1
Its roots are in science. They repeat it on a nice schedule. One other thing that's great about the relationship is they let us shoot a ton of episodes, which allows us to really format the sport properly.

[00:32:44.710] - Speaker 2
This season, we did 54 hours, one season. Incredible. It used to be you did 100 hours, you were syndicated, and we did 54 hours in one season, and we shoot it in 10 days. What show can you do that?

[00:33:00.890] - Speaker 1
You go to any network and they're saying, We love your show. Ten episodes, guys. And to really format the sport properly for all the robots around the world that want to compete in it. This is the best of the best. To do it in 10 episodes is impossible. We're going to do 22-hour shows this season, plus a summer special. And that's what we needed to do, basically, the madness of World Championship 7.

[00:33:26.080] - Speaker 3
If there was no historical precedent for television, and if you were starting now, would this all just be on YouTube, or would you still be looking for a TV deal?

[00:33:36.010] - Speaker 2
That's a good question because there's an opportunity. Our deals with Discovery are year by year. I don't quite understand that game, to be honest with you. I don't watch Netflix or any of the stuff online. I'm not an emailer. I don't know how people find you that way. I change a channel, and when you get to that, I'm old school. I a changing channel, you get to that channel, that looks interesting. You watch it. How do you find that? You have to be on the homepage? How far do you dive into Netflix before you find it? Or how much do they promote it?

[00:34:11.250] - Speaker 3
I'm also asking because I've had personally the opposite experience, which I was looking for battle bots. I'm searching. It's hard for me to find. Finally, there's some information. It's on the Discovery channel, and then I go to the Discovery channel, and it's behind a paywall. It's not a channel that I subscribe to. There's already a load of channels that I subscribe that I don't watch, and I don't want to see anything on the Discovery channel other than battle bots. Am I going to subscribe to the Discovery channel for battle bots? I don't know. Exactly. I don't know. In my case, it might have been, I'm an active viewer and I might not be willing to go there.

[00:34:47.780] - Speaker 1
Welcome to the world of television right ownership.

[00:34:50.670] - Speaker 3
It's so confusing.

[00:34:51.610] - Speaker 1
It's so confusing. Internationales are even worse because you have to do the deal that works. I think we're maybe at the spot now where we could do a YouTube. We could certainly do a Netflix or a Hulu or an Apple TV or an Amazon because they have decent budgets. But it's not a cheap show to produce. The arena alone, maintenance on that and the restructuring of it, the rebuilding of it, it gets pummeled every year. It's built such a way that a bomb could go off in and everyone would be fine.

[00:35:17.370] - Speaker 3
Tell me the story of when it was the arena originally conceived of and built.

[00:35:22.400] - Speaker 2
Back in the Robot Wars days, we had a piece of plywood that stood about that high, and that was it. Then we put a little piece of lexan in the front and shit would go over the lexan or whatever. It was very dangerous. It was a little Mark Paulina in a way. Part of my input on Battlebots is making it safe. The whole goal is having nobody ever get hurt. So contain these robots. And the robots get tougher and tougher every year. I rebuilt the arena again last year, two years ago, two seasons ago, I redid my floor and made it like I thought it was going to be bulletproof. And it was, made it that entire season with very little to any damage, which was great. I go, finally, I fixed the floor because you'll see people get stuck in the floor. Two seasons ago, you didn't. They came back this year and they beat the crap out of my floor again. I'm like, what has changed? The motors are the same. We had brushless motors two years ago, and that was the big gap that happened over. What they figured out was how to dial in their speed controllers to make the brushless motors that much more powerful and how to program them properly.

[00:36:29.880] - Speaker 2
And so they beat the crap out of my floor again. And now I've got to go back. The arena is my bot now. That's how I try to contain it. When you come to the event and you see my bulletproof glass, which the glass alone is over a million bucks in that arena. The thickness of the floor, all the-What's the size of it? Fifty by fifty, roughly.

[00:36:51.090] - Speaker 3
Fifty by fifty?

[00:36:52.330] - Speaker 1
About 25 feet tall.

[00:36:55.100] - Speaker 2
Amazing. It's half the size of a basketball court.

[00:36:57.820] - Speaker 3
And it's also changed a lot In from the early days, it seemed like it was a lot of ground and pound action, and now there's a lot of stuff flying. It seems like the bots are strong enough to throw each other around, and it's dramatic.

[00:37:12.270] - Speaker 2
They're tossing. People hit the roof this year. So a couple of robots a couple of times hit the roof.

[00:37:17.680] - Speaker 3
So you have a 250 pound object.

[00:37:20.950] - Speaker 2
Yeah. Flying.

[00:37:21.800] - Speaker 3
Flying 25 feet in the air.

[00:37:24.470] - Speaker 2
And what goes up must come down. It's serious. It's serious. You You see the dents in the arena, people go, Oh, my God. And the steel is major.

[00:37:34.770] - Speaker 3
It's like a shooting range, essentially. It's worse.

[00:37:37.280] - Speaker 2
It is worse. These robots could kill people in seconds without a question. The only place you can play is in the battle box.

[00:37:45.620] - Speaker 3
It's so great that you use the robots for good.

[00:37:50.480] - Speaker 1
Well, if anything were to happen.

[00:37:54.430] - Speaker 2
Somebody was...

[00:37:55.700] - Speaker 1
Anyone needs any protection.

[00:37:57.500] - Speaker 2
But Elon was Elon was talking about the Terminator scenario or an AI taking over the world. Well, that's what Battle Boats will take care of, the problem.

[00:38:09.320] - Speaker 3
We'll take out the other problem. Good to know.

[00:38:11.020] - Speaker 1
When ChatGPT7 takes over the planet. Tell me more about the business model.

[00:38:16.500] - Speaker 3
How do you find the creators and basically how does it work?

[00:38:21.290] - Speaker 2
Do we have to have a business model?

[00:38:22.350] - Speaker 3
No, but I'm asking.

[00:38:24.240] - Speaker 1
The community is so strong now that they pretty much come to us. We have a website administration. Battlebots. Com, which will soon probably be changed to book. Battlebots. Com, I forget what it. Anyway, you can apply there, and you upload your pictures, your CAD files, picture yourself, get a little resume going. Then we search through those, we weed through those, and we search for the bots who we want on the TV show.

[00:38:47.050] - Speaker 3
How many entries do you get?

[00:38:48.550] - Speaker 1
We've got probably more than 500 in there, but year upon year, we probably get 100 extra per year. And there's always the usual suspects who have to come back. You got to have the Hydras and the tombstones and all those folks come back again. A couple of teams might be put into relegation because they didn't do so hot last season. But then we go through the applications and we'll find probably 20 who are pretty damn good. Then we'll have this, we call it the chair throwing me where Trey and I and our showrunner, Aaron Catling and Chris Cauen will sit there, and Tom Gutterage, who's also on the AP. And Pete, the bot whisper. We'll just argue about our favorite robots and rally, advocate for No, we got to have that robot. The orange one is the coolest. And then we'll pick six of those or 10 of those maybe, out of the 20 to replace some of the bots who had to go into relegation. And then there's always a series of alternates who will get in if someone drops out. It's usually 50 to do the show, and off we go.

[00:39:50.320] - Speaker 3
Is there any way during the weekly shows that you do to be testing the bots for the-So that is a great segue, the proving grounds.

[00:39:59.860] - Speaker 2
So Like I said a few seconds ago, nobody could play with these robots except in the battle box, and that's been part of the problem. Now we have a nightly live show in Vegas where we're showing the audience a simulation of what you watch on TV is what it is. We have opportunities for newbies to come perform and prove to us that they are capable and qualified to go into the television show. It also allows our past participants, our shows to come practice. No place can they take these and try new tires, try new speed controllers, try new things. Well, now they can come to the live show, compete in the live show in front of an audience and dial these things in, which is going to help our TV show. And the newbies, if Greg and I were choosing, like we do now, who's going to come to the Battlebot event, we would have never chose LaMachine to come to the event. We would have never. Lamachine was one of the greatest robots television-wise at that time for what it did.

[00:41:04.640] - Speaker 3
So sometimes just seeing it perform is more important than what you think it's going to do.

[00:41:09.650] - Speaker 1
You can only get so much across in a picture, in a CAD file, in a video. They have to submit a video, too. Whereas you see it really fight, you're like, oh, my God, that thing's amazing. Or it's funny, or it's something that's worthy of it getting a spot.

[00:41:22.840] - Speaker 2
There's always newbies that we let into the TV show that are like, I'm working for NASA, and I can build this, and I build these famous things for Darpa, and I'm a great builder. And we go, okay, and they submit a great design, and they do crappy. They almost always or always, I don't know if one has ever proven themselves to us, but you've got to come and compete a couple of times. You got to come and see a show before you ever build anything and see how big and bad these robots really are and how really strong they are. They're not toys. They're not little. Some are 6 feet tall. Some are 5, 6 feet wide. If you When you look at Mammoth, it stands way above you and way wider than you.

[00:42:04.050] - Speaker 1
But Mammoth is a great example because we learned about Mammoth from video at a local competition in Florida, so we got to see it and we're like, Oh, my God, that thing is crazy. That's got to be on the show. Where if that was just an application on a website. You wouldn't know. That thing looks like a jungle gym. It's going to break in five seconds is what we would have thought. But by seeing it really fight, it actually knocks people out of the arena. They're like, Oh, that's cool.

[00:42:27.610] - Speaker 3
It's such a crazy world. It's so fun hearing about it. It's like a whole world.

[00:42:34.100] - Speaker 1
It is. It's a crazy, weird subculture. Yeah.

[00:42:36.860] - Speaker 3
I feel like the people who are into it are obsessed with it.

[00:42:40.250] - Speaker 1
Beyond.

[00:42:40.950] - Speaker 2
The people that are there are the best people in the world. There's no other event. You can't go to a concert or anything and find these people. They don't exist, but at Battle Bots. They come, they share, they help each other out. If your motor is broken, I'll give you one of my spares because if I'm going up I don't want you saying that I lost because my motor was broken. I want you to say, I beat you fair and square.

[00:43:05.140] - Speaker 3
Amazing.

[00:43:05.880] - Speaker 2
They all love each other. They all get along terrific.

[00:43:09.130] - Speaker 1
That's one part of the show that I have to say, anything's lacking in our show, it's not seeing enough of the pit because A, the camaraderie that Trey was just talking about is huge. It's amazing of them helping each other. But also just the trials and tribulations of my whole robot just got destroyed. Literally like two pieces, like the fight between cobalt and ghost wrapped where it was split in half, and it's like two pieces. Chuck rebuilt that whole robot in 48 hours and made his next fight.Unbelievable.That story is crazy, right?Unbelievable.How did he do it? Yeah. I mean, that's some engineering insanity.

[00:43:43.690] - Speaker 3
Yeah. That's another rule is that if you're damaged, you have to be in good enough shape for the next battle, otherwise you're out. Yeah, exactly. Even if you win.

[00:43:52.450] - Speaker 1
Before each fight, you have to weigh in, obviously, and you have to do a functional test, meaning your weapon's got to work and you got to be able to drive and you got to be able to fail safe, obviously, because we don't want radio problems. If they can't do that, we'll postpone you as far as we can. But if we reach our end of our shoot day, which happened to glitch last season, sorry, glitch, you can't make it. That was a tournament fight, which was horrible for us because we've never had a robot who couldn't make it. But typically, robots will rally, and they'll find the most amazing solutions for that problem to just get back in the ring.

[00:44:27.240] - Speaker 3
Would you say that there's a personality type amongst the builders that's a similarity in the people who are building these?

[00:44:35.850] - Speaker 2
Engineers are interesting people. They are definitely the weirdest people that you can hang out with. They don't communicate real well. They're not real people people to a certain extent, most of them, you can get that when you watch the TV show and some of them are interviewed. They're all smarter than... I mean, at the end of the world, these are the people you want to be with. These are the ones you want in your cave or whatever because they're survivors. They know how to make things and how to figure things out. But they're different.

[00:45:03.570] - Speaker 1
When the zombie Apocalypse happens, they'll be the ones to figure out the perfect compound and get the power back on and get the water flowing again.

[00:45:11.810] - Speaker 3
What are the logos on the bots? Because sometimes I'm watching and I don't know the name of the bot, and I read a logo, but that's not the name of the bot.

[00:45:20.290] - Speaker 1
Yeah, so we allow sponsorship. When Trey was talking before how we wanted to find the right TV deal for the builders as well as for us, it's all about getting the buy-off from the network to allow corporate sponsors on the bots themselves, just like a NASCAR would or a Formula One car would, because these things are expensive. We have build stipends and other travel stipends and hotels and shipping, blah, blah, blah, that's covered in our budget. But it doesn't get you all the money that you would need to build some of these robots.

[00:45:48.360] - Speaker 3
If you win, what do you win?

[00:45:50.570] - Speaker 1
We've done something, which I think is pretty cool with the prize money, is we do it, and the builders wanted to do it, is instead of giving some ginormous purse at the end, we just split it over every fight, win or lose.

[00:46:04.000] - Speaker 3
Great.

[00:46:04.530] - Speaker 1
So you just get money because you're damaged. When they're fighting, they see dollar signs. Oh, my God, speed controller, $2,000. Oh, shit. That was a motor. That's another $800. But they know at the end of the fight, win or lose, they got some cash. Cool.

[00:46:18.230] - Speaker 2
I would say it's mostly a break-even deal for most of the teams. I would imagine. From their sponsorship money, and maybe their time they put in is a little bit more in most cases. Some are making money doing it, not all.

[00:46:31.560] - Speaker 1
The sponsors are getting better. For sure.

[00:46:33.430] - Speaker 3
Do these people have time to do any other thing in their lives, or is this their full-time? No.

[00:46:38.290] - Speaker 1
They're full-on got families and jobs. There's always this dance we have to do of like, Okay, when are we going to shoot it? Schools, colleges got to get off. Other people have to take their two weeks from their job. There's always this sweet spot that we find in the middle of the year that coincides with when the network wants to hook us up, that coincides with when the building is available, and all these other things. That it's really a big production number. It's big orchestration, but then we make it happen over two weeks.

[00:47:05.300] - Speaker 2
My guess is what you'll find with your son is that this will inspire him. Before, he might have been playing video games or sticking on his iPad or iPhone, which is not going to take him anywhere. He's going to say, Dad, help me do something. Help me build one of these. I want to go compete. I want to go come watch first, but then I want to go compete. He'll start small. Then he's going to go into engineering when he gets into high school, college, the rest of it. The rest of it, the guy's going to become a math wizard. He's going to be working for the space program like a lot of our participants. Technically, back in 1994 with the Robot Wars days and all the kids that have grown up with us have become something special, every single one of them.

[00:47:46.400] - Speaker 3
So cool.

[00:47:47.360] - Speaker 1
There's a whole supply chain culture forming around the sport now. Batter suppliers, speed controller, and really on demand parts. These companies that have a giant water jet machine. It's just this thing that you put a big piece of metal down on it and it cuts parts for you. Those companies are booming right now because I don't know if they're booming, but they're doing pretty well because of not just our sport, but we're a nice chunk of it.

[00:48:13.930] - Speaker 2
Well, we're making those things that people want to make now. Our our participants don't buy a skateboard, a motorized skateboard. They don't make one. They make their own electric bike. They make their own whatever they want. That's a beautiful thing.

[00:48:28.110] - Speaker 3
Tell me more about the building the arena and how it's changed from the beginning to now. So you said it started, it was just a wooden platform to start with, and now it's this 50 by 50 thing. How many seats are there in the place for viewers?

[00:48:43.310] - Speaker 2
A thousand. A thousand.

[00:48:44.670] - Speaker 3
A thousand seats? Yeah. Wow.

[00:48:47.110] - Speaker 2
That we'd like to film lately. So far, we haven't gotten that far. We're about 300 to 500.

[00:48:51.820] - Speaker 3
How long has it been where people could just come all the time and see Battlebot?

[00:48:55.730] - Speaker 2
So we just did our 25th show.

[00:48:58.950] - Speaker 3
25th, so it's a brand new thing.

[00:49:00.100] - Speaker 2
Month. Yeah.

[00:49:00.390] - Speaker 3
And it's Nightly.

[00:49:03.240] - Speaker 2
It's Nightly.

[00:49:04.450] - Speaker 1
So it's a brand It's monthly. It's nightly. It's nightly. Battlebot's Destructathon is the nightly show. Think of it as a showcase version of the TV show. Yes. Real fights, no outcomes determined. You'll see your favorite bots from the show. You see Happer Shack, Wish Doctor, all that stuff.

[00:49:17.280] - Speaker 3
You can only see this if you come live. Correct.

[00:49:20.160] - Speaker 1
Then we'll stop that down.

[00:49:21.250] - Speaker 3
That's an interesting thing to think about also. Would that be a good thing to have on YouTube or Twitch or something?

[00:49:26.880] - Speaker 1
Oh, hell, yeah.

[00:49:27.290] - Speaker 3
Just to build the- When we get the proving ground part of it added to Destructathon, absolutely.

[00:49:33.740] - Speaker 1
We'll want to stream that on Twitch because that's people's opportunity, not just live in Vegas, but around the world, to see the potential new bots to come to World Championship 8, which we'll try to do as soon as we Again, this orchestration between the builders and the network and all that stuff. And F1 is coming to Las Vegas, which is crazy. They're our next-door neighbor, so that's going to be a real challenge and a lot of fun.

[00:49:56.320] - Speaker 3
Yeah, they might even be a crossover.

[00:49:57.730] - Speaker 1
Who knows for Stoppen and Hamilton, fight some robots.

[00:50:00.440] - Speaker 2
It might help them fix some of those cars up a little faster, too.

[00:50:03.050] - Speaker 3
How does what's happening in this world compare or relate to what's going on with, is it called, Boston Dynamics, the people who make the robots that you hear about, not the fighting robots.

[00:50:19.360] - Speaker 2
Atlas, which was made by Boston Dynamics, was actually made by Scott LaVallee, who was one of our buddies that we built robots with as little kids. So there's a crossover. There's definitely a crossover.

[00:50:31.330] - Speaker 1
We get flack from engineers all the time. They're not real robots. You can't use the term robot because the term robot implies a certain amount of autonomy. So your dishwasher has more autonomy than a battlebot. That's why we call them a battlebot, because they're remote control. The Boston Dynamics stuff is the state of the art for AI-controlled and bipedal, inverse kinematic walking systems that can be used for all kinds of stuff. We are remote control attack vehicles to thrill you and entertain the crap out of you. Remote vehicles.

[00:51:10.530] - Speaker 2
But our contestant made one of the bomb disposal robots, which is similar.

[00:51:16.360] - Speaker 3
It's the same principles, but a different application.

[00:51:19.890] - Speaker 1
Yeah. There's a meta-application, like I talked about before, is that if you know how it's going to break, you're going to be a better engineer on how to fix it, and you're going to be able to build better. That's why a battlebot engineer who's been through the trials and tribulations of the actual show shoot, where you're fixing your robot again and again from total destruction to almost perfection five times over two weeks, That becomes the best engineer to help you build the next version of Atlas, because when Atlas falls down the stairs, well, I know how to make it better. I've dealt with that with Ghostrafter, whatever it is.

[00:51:55.830] - Speaker 2
What you learn from a robot braking is phenomenal. We still crash cars, even though we could crash them on a computer over and over and not have to physically crash it. We still physically crash cars because we learn something from that. What you learn from building these robots and building these axles and brakes and everything else that we put into them, these are the people you want building your car because they're going to make it so it will be safer, it will be stronger.

[00:52:19.950] - Speaker 3
It seems like there's something about when you get your data virtually, you get something from it, but you don't get everything from it. I know when it comes to recording studios, the old recording studios that were built before there were computers, the great ones sound great. Now, the way recording studios are designed, it's all computer-rendering for sound. When you're in them, they don't have the same life that these old studios have, and something gets lost in the translation. There's something that incalculable that's different than just the stats that are measurable.

[00:52:59.070] - Speaker 1
A hundred %. And that's what I think we're going to discover with AI, is everyone's all on the ChatGPT bandwagon, but if you use it, spits out stuff that's a little bit generic. It's a little bit sanitized. I mean, of course, you can prompt it better, and it's going to get better and better at tricking us, but it'll never be able to write like Shakespeare.

[00:53:18.220] - Speaker 3
Well, I heard an interesting thingFamous last words. About all of the different AIs, the competing AIs, is that if they all have the same data, if they're all starting with the same data set which currently they are, that as they get better and better, the answer that you get from any of them will just be the same. You'll always get the same answer from all of them.

[00:53:39.670] - Speaker 1
Yeah, which makes you wonder, is two years from now, are we going to have just AI stagnation or AI homogenization, where it's just, Okay, the AI wrote that, obviously. Let's get some humans in to train it better, or for us to take it as a base, and then we'll add the humanity on top of If you were to take a song and you give it to five different artists to perform it, you'll hear five very different versions of that song.

[00:54:08.560] - Speaker 3
If you take a script and give it to five different directors, you'll get five very different movies. It sounds like with AI, you'll get the same one every time. That doesn't sound so interesting.

[00:54:19.960] - Speaker 1
No, exactly. Or it'll be this... You'll really be able to sniff out. It's trying to be like Steven Spielberg. It got trained on Steven Spielberg movies, this AI movie, and you'll be able to sniff it out. I think we're going to get more and more sophisticated in our perceptions of that stuff. I don't think the human artistry is dead quite yet, hopefully.

[00:54:39.510] - Speaker 3
Tell me, what are the rules of Battlebot's competition?

[00:54:44.850] - Speaker 2
When we started, it was very simple. There's a few rules, common sense, no gunpowder.

[00:54:51.900] - Speaker 3
Are there any gas, gasoline-powered bots?

[00:54:55.030] - Speaker 2
There are. Yeah. Icewave is one of them that's still around. Slam. Blendo was one by Jamie. Adam, Mythbusters Guys was a gas-powered. Mark's Master was gas-powered with a chainsaw. There's been a few.

[00:55:09.630] - Speaker 1
When we were in the Comedy Central era in the '90s, we tried to figure out everything that we didn't want people to do. It was too much. The rule book was like 50 pages. You can't do this, you can't do this, you can't do this, but you can't do this.It stifled creativity, too.It.

[00:55:21.390] - Speaker 2
Was over the top. People would think of bots that we would have allowed, but the rules didn't allow them to. We took that eventually out and threw it away and said, Look, submit your robot idea. We'll tell you what you can and can't do. That's where we're at now. There are some common sense rules, but it's-There's a weight rule.

[00:55:38.670] - Speaker 1
There's a weight rules, and you have to have an active weapon, and you can't do it.

[00:55:41.770] - Speaker 3
Is there a size?

[00:55:42.550] - Speaker 2
It has to fit in the door. It has to fit in the door.

[00:55:44.570] - Speaker 3
It has to fit in the door.

[00:55:45.160] - Speaker 2
But there are ones that have come in the door and then open up.

[00:55:47.720] - Speaker 3
Yeah, if it can't fit in the door.

[00:55:48.770] - Speaker 2
We can't.

[00:55:49.790] - Speaker 1
Got to fit in the red square, blue square.

[00:55:51.340] - Speaker 2
We had somebody show up the very first year and he says, Okay, I'm here. I go, Where's your robot? He says, It's in my car. I'm like, Well, go get it. He Well, it's part of the car. We're like, Well, he had an EMP. He was going to knock the power out in San Francisco for about a mile around, right? Throwing the switch of his car. I don't think it would have worked, but we're like... Because it wasn't in the rules that you couldn't have an EMP. We had kids show up with tape once. One of the great stories was a very fancy robot with virtual already goggles and cameras on it and a turret that went in and out, and it would toss nets and all this stuff. I think they spent $70,000 on this robot, and these two kids build two wooden boxes with duct tape between them and carpet over them. Multibot starts as one, breaks off, spreads out the tape, and duct tapes up the $70,000 robot. It was great. The audience went crazy, but it wouldn't have made good TV the second time. We can't allow tape at this point.

[00:56:53.140] - Speaker 2
People come up with ideas like dumping water or glue. We had a guy that submitted something that he had this hot knife that he was going to cut through steel with, and I doubt he could have done it. I doubt he could have enough power, I mean, electricity to even pull that off. But stuff like that. How do we remove that? How long does it take to cool down? How do we shoot the next...

[00:57:14.450] - Speaker 1
So the only negatives from us are practicality or just that's not a great fight. Throwing water on your opponent is the perfect example because the robot, it's not going to be a spectacular end to a fight. It's just going to dead. So that's a no-go. But if you keep the weapons mechanical and within the weight limit and can fit, we're pretty good to go.

[00:57:37.560] - Speaker 2
We need to see it. If you can't see it, it's not going to make a TV. So we don't want to allow... We had people show up with hayla to put out some of the gas motors and stuff. Halon eats the oxygen that stops. It's like a fire extinguisher thing. That doesn't make good television. You can't see it. It's electrically shocking. The other robot is another thing you can't really see. There's ways to protect to that. Flame makes good television. It doesn't work real well, but it makes good TV, so you allow that.

[00:58:07.530] - Speaker 1
Trey and I still, though, we still have the animal house and the ending of animal house in our heads, and we do want to have a robot that releases 10,000 marbles just to see what happens. That'd be great. That would be so great. Clean up on aisle 4, but let's do it. We don't mind psychological warfare either. Trey and I, one time, we went against this guy named Carlo Bertucini, who was the best guy He'd show up with a screwdriver and a battery charger, and that's all he needed to fix his robot because it was so well-engineered. It was a study in perfection. Oh, my God, we have to fight Carlo. Instead of stressing over how we're going to beat him mechanically, we tried it psychologically. So we put a picture of his wife on top of the robot, on top of our robot, thinking he would never want to attack his own wife. I don't know if it was a good idea, but- There's a lot of mental games that go on during the event.

[00:58:59.240] - Speaker 3
Tell me some of This is interesting. Psychological game.

[00:59:01.720] - Speaker 2
My favorite one was actually Jamie Heinemann. This is early days, way before they were mythbusters or anything. And he built Lendo, and he's gone up against, I don't know what the other team was, but he goes over and talks to me. He says, Hey, how are you doing? Cool looking robot. Oh, wow, we're going up against you next. He's all nice and everything else. Then he turns and he walks away. As he walks away, he pops a couple of Alka cellsars in his mouth, and he gets his blood up, and he turns himself all red, and he turns around and looks at the guy, and he starts grueling out of his mouth and the saliva and bubbles are dripping. He gets all mad. The guy sitting over there just scared to death, starts shaking, and he's going up against him next. That's so fun. Absolutely classic.

[00:59:42.160] - Speaker 1
People will take pool noodles. Rob The robot edges are very sharp, so people have to cover them in the pit because you don't want to scrape your knee as you walk past one. That's actually one of our biggest rules. But people will use pool noodles to cover up corners, but they'll also take them off, sneak over to the other guy's pit and use them as measuring. They'll use them as yard sticks to measure how far are they off the ground? How big is that saw blade? What's their clearance on their wheelbase? Then they'll go back and have all these little Sharpie marks on their pool noodle and figure out a way to reconfigure their bot because they're going to fight that guy next. So they can get underneath them or do whatever. So there's all kinds of games.

[01:00:18.550] - Speaker 3
That's an interesting idea. So the bot makers don't know who they're going to fight in advance. They do now.

[01:00:23.410] - Speaker 2
In the old days-How long in advance did they know? So in the old days, up until the season, we basically told them the day before. So they didn't know until that night before. 3:00 in the morning. Now, we tell them the first four fights that they're going to be in. You're going to be in four fights. Here's the four people you're going to go up against. And strategically, you can decide which weapons you're going to use, what you're going to sacrifice. A lot of people have different ideas, attachments for what robot they're going up against. They might not want to lose. They might only have one of those attachments. They might want to save that for the nightmare fight or something.

[01:00:57.110] - Speaker 3
You can have a different attachment. If you win fight, and then in the next fight, your robot can change for that next fight. It's just what happens if someone has a second matching robot?

[01:01:09.190] - Speaker 2
They can't. They're allowed to.

[01:01:10.800] - Speaker 1
You should have because there's so many fights you really should have. People come with probably three spares. You should have at least three spares. People usually have three now.

[01:01:18.130] - Speaker 3
Of the same robot.

[01:01:19.040] - Speaker 1
If you see Team Hypershock, they are rolling deep with three Hypershock chassis and probably 40 spare parts. Their pit table is just an array of defenders and wheel guards and tires and everything they need to fix it a time. Because they'll fight probably, I mean, I'm getting this number wrong, but maybe if they do well in both championships, 12 times.

[01:01:42.130] - Speaker 3
Yeah.

[01:01:43.220] - Speaker 2
That's crazy. The pits are unbelievable. When you walk into the venue, you'll see our arena and everything else, the thousand seats. It's a big, big area. And your pit tent is much bigger than the arena side. And you see there's 2,000 people in there, and there's all the pit tables and all the parts.

[01:02:01.790] - Speaker 3
So the pit section is bigger than the arena.

[01:02:03.550] - Speaker 2
It's massive. The energy in there is unbelievable. You got to come for the live show, but you also got to come for the TV shooting. The TV shooting, it's tougher to watch because we're filming television. So we've got the announcement goes up or Farouk messes up, and we got to read, shoot, reshoot, reshoot, get the lighting right. I mean, the fights themselves, once they start, it goes till that part. But everything else is up and down. We'll ask people to sit for four hours. The live show is an hour and a half, and it's fast entertainment of just fight after fight after fight and a little bit of video while we're sweeping the floor.

[01:02:42.180] - Speaker 3
When after a particularly gruesome battle And if one of the robots gets trashed bad, how do you get it off the field?

[01:02:52.030] - Speaker 2
We go in there and sweep it up, put it in garbage bags, and take it outside.

[01:02:56.180] - Speaker 1
Trey has a crew called the Crewbots, which are dudes who who are super fast and safe at getting the bots on carts, rolling them out, putting out the fires, dealing with all the issues that can happen inside the box. The whole box has this exhaust system that deals with the fires, Yeah, Trey's crew has gotten that really, really tight, even in the TV show.

[01:03:19.970] - Speaker 3
Why do you think kids are so obsessed with it?

[01:03:22.040] - Speaker 1
That's a good question. I think it's just so much fun. It's like Trey was saying earlier, it's this hunt. It's this thing that's ingrained in us in our lower brainstem that is expressed in this really fun, sci-fi cool way, maybe, that you see these machines. I don't want to be too sexist about boys really love these things, and the machines, and they dig it. It's also fighting, which is also fun and exciting. Something about that.

[01:03:51.120] - Speaker 2
We had a make a wish kid three nights ago. At the end, after everybody left, I let him drive which doctor was his favorite robot. I said, Come on over. I'm going to let you drive Which Doctor in the box. He's driving it around. He's driving great. He's missing everything, everything like this. Finally, he goes over and hits the wall. His mom goes, Don't hit the wall. And I'm like, No, it's okay. Hit the wall. I think we're told not to break our toys. We're told to be careful. We do things so safe in the world.

[01:04:20.940] - Speaker 3
There's a freedom in it.

[01:04:21.970] - Speaker 2
There's something about it's okay to break your toy here. It's okay to let go. It's okay to do something. You know what? Again, you it. You can always build it again. That part's...

[01:04:33.260] - Speaker 1
What does everyone do with their sandcastle at the end? Jump on it. You jump on it or you let the waves take it down.

[01:04:38.980] - Speaker 2
What's the satisfaction?

[01:04:40.970] - Speaker 1
It's the yin-yang of construction and deconstruction, right? It's like you build it, but you also want to see it. It's fun to see it get destroyed. And Battle Bot gives you the ability to do it.

[01:04:52.120] - Speaker 3
It's like the Tibeten monks who do these sand mandalas and spend time making this intricate, intricate sand mandala with different colors, and it's magnificent. And as soon as it's done, they wipe it away.

[01:05:04.830] - Speaker 1
Yeah, and that speaks to the- Just the impermanence of everything. Yeah, right. Everything is ephemeral eventually, right? Yeah. That's a good lesson for humans to know because that's it. Life is what it is. It's real. It's real.

[01:05:18.830] - Speaker 3
When did the idea of traps in the arena become a thing?

[01:05:24.010] - Speaker 1
That was there from the Robot Wars days.

[01:05:26.510] - Speaker 3
Old time, there's always been- They had flippers and bumpers and nets.

[01:05:31.480] - Speaker 1
But when the battle box was first built, the vision was to have it raised two feet off the ground so you have stuff pop up from underneath, the first of which was the kill sauce.

[01:05:44.660] - Speaker 2
Robots back then were a little boring. This was to make it a little more interesting. Plus, partly through a fight, if you did have an active weapon, it would maybe be broken, and this would make the fight a little bit more interesting. Now, you can take them over to the pulverizer, take them over the saws, push them there, make That also makes good television.

[01:06:01.310] - Speaker 3
What's also interesting about that is that those can be stronger than anything that you could put on a bot. It's a way to get heavy artillery involved.

[01:06:09.300] - Speaker 2
It is. Yeah. We're at one of our new ideas, which we'll mention here for the first time, is to allow the participants. We have the pulverizers are now controlled by the participants, so they control the hammers. The saws come up randomly. The little flipper things and a couple of things are all done randomly.

[01:06:28.130] - Speaker 3
Do you have the the corkscrew thing?

[01:06:31.880] - Speaker 2
Yeah, those just got turned on. But the one idea is we're going to allow the participants to put a weapon on the pulverizers so they can attach, they could pull the hammer off if they want, put their own weapon on there, and now they're controlling their own weapon in that corner, which might add a new element to the show.

[01:06:49.900] - Speaker 3
But wouldn't both sides get to use the same pulverizer?

[01:06:53.060] - Speaker 2
No, so they each get two pulverizers. So one's right in front of them and one's directly kiddy corner. I see.

[01:06:59.010] - Speaker 3
I thought the pulverizer were just equally against everybody.

[01:07:02.140] - Speaker 1
That's why you'll see it sometimes where, why isn't the hammer hitting? It's because that's my hammer. I don't want to hit my bot. I see.

[01:07:07.820] - Speaker 2
There's a timing and a strategy for that.

[01:07:10.980] - Speaker 1
Sometimes they use the hammer. Is there any way to color code? It is color coded. It is. Well, it's probably not good for the audience. Yeah, it's on the floor. It's on the floor. If you see a little diamond that's red underneath the hammer, that's the red side's hammer. I see. That's how you know. But the floor gets so beat up. It's only the first fight of the day after the paint job at four o'clock in the morning the previous night, that you really can see it. We've probably come up with a better way for the audience to know.

[01:07:37.060] - Speaker 3
Would there be any benefit in putting a red flag and a blue flag on the bots themselves? Because once they start, we don't know who's red.

[01:07:46.000] - Speaker 1
Or there's a lower third that shows you something. Something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:07:50.040] - Speaker 2
Yeah.

[01:07:59.920] - Speaker 1
Attachment onto the hammer, the red hammer versus the blue hammer.

[01:08:02.940] - Speaker 3
It'll be more exciting knowing, yeah, the blue bot's about to go under the red hammer.

[01:08:09.810] - Speaker 2
It's-yeah, point.

[01:08:10.530] - Speaker 3
It adds more drama. It's true.

[01:08:12.320] - Speaker 1
We've had some fun ideas for the arena that we just haven't done.

[01:08:15.380] - Speaker 2
We've had tons of ideas.

[01:08:16.860] - Speaker 1
We wanted to have a bowling ball shooting machine that the red and blue side. That's a great idea. If your partner on your team could have blue bowling balls or red bowling balls that they just pummel, almost like a shotgun, that they shoot out at the other- That's a great idea.

[01:08:30.320] - Speaker 3
Yeah. I want to see that.

[01:08:33.210] - Speaker 2
There's a lot of ideas. We wanted to have the drivers in the middle of the arena on scissor lifts, and they could actually go up and down at their will to better see and control Wow.

[01:08:46.290] - Speaker 1
Then it'd be a perimeter protecting the scissor lifts, of course.

[01:08:49.080] - Speaker 3
That's an interesting idea.

[01:08:50.050] - Speaker 1
But it just becomes one of these money things. We didn't want it to wind up being too much like a crazy game show. But maybe one day we'll add some cool stuff, extra stuff.

[01:08:59.850] - Speaker 3
Or even just the perch above is interesting. I guess in terms of steering, where they are is probably the best place for actual steering.

[01:09:07.460] - Speaker 2
Back to driving. Driving is difficult. It's difficult just to drive remote control, anything away from you. When you turn it towards yourself, it changes, right? Everything's backwards.

[01:09:16.470] - Speaker 3
Yeah, everything changes.

[01:09:17.700] - Speaker 2
When robots flip upside down, now you're dealing with multiple factors. Then you've got all kinds of things. Is it wheel bend? Is it gripping? Now I can't drive straight because this is gripping. Is it tire slipping more? Is it tire gripping more is all these different factors, centrifical motion, all the weapons that spin, they cause an object in rest, an object in motion, centrifical motion, all that. It makes it much more difficult. You'll see robots flip up. You'll see things that you just physics happening in that box that affect your driving. It makes it even harder. People are like, Why does he miss the robot? They looked like they were trying to hit each other. Well, that's because that centrifical weapon is forcing him over here and he's trying to counter and that wheel slipped, and the traction on that saw blade lexan is less than the actual floor. The paint's gone on that part of that section. There's so many reasons it makes it so difficult.

[01:10:11.090] - Speaker 3
It seems like the best spots when they get flipped over can write themselves or can still continue upside down and work.

[01:10:17.920] - Speaker 2
The old days, we had a lot of robots that lost by getting flipped over. Nowadays, everybody's figured that out. You've got to make sure you can drive inverted.

[01:10:26.100] - Speaker 1
You better have a strategy.

[01:10:26.920] - Speaker 3
Or you flip back over. Are there any general rules, like low center of gravity is good, or are there any general good practices if you're building a robot?

[01:10:37.260] - Speaker 1
You want good grip because you got to drive. The audience complains a lot about exposed tires. So builders go back and forth, having non-exposed tires versus exposed tires. Some people don't care because I'm so fast. You got to catch me and get the tire off. But the best practices are really probably in the electronics with the lithium polymer batteries, which have a lot of strength to weight ratio. You get a ton of power out of those things.

[01:11:03.680] - Speaker 3
When did those first come into the game?

[01:11:05.720] - Speaker 1
Really in the early 2000s. Like Trey said earlier, back in the '90s, we had a car battery. Then people did Nikads, which were the stuff you'd see in the... You'd shove in your Super 8 video camera back in the day. Now it's lithium batteries, either life batteries or life polymer batteries. That's what's in your electric car. That's what allows the Tesla to go from zero to whatever and nothing. You just get that strength, that power out of those. That's why we can see not only the drives go super fast, but the weapons spinning amazingly fast and powerful and delivering blows like, I don't know, Muhammad Ali bot, just crazy.

[01:11:47.170] - Speaker 3
Is there any downside to speed in a bot?

[01:11:50.490] - Speaker 2
I don't think so.

[01:11:51.970] - Speaker 3
Faster tends to be better. Yeah.

[01:11:54.080] - Speaker 2
We hate wedges, right? Being the first wedge, we hate wedges, right?

[01:11:59.640] - Speaker 3
However, everybody We don't have a sweet spot for the wedge?

[01:12:01.700] - Speaker 2
No, we have just the opposite. One of the ways to fix wedges is you make the floor uneven, or you put bumps and change the floor, you put it in a different level, you go up an inch or whatever, and that would change it. But that also takes away from And speed is good. Speed makes great television. Speed makes great action. When you come to a live show, we pretty much have been ending the live show with the Which Doctor Hyper shock fight. And the two of those robots are so fast. They're just jetting all over the arena and slamming into each other and the parts that are lying. It's spectacular. But it's a need speed.

[01:12:33.110] - Speaker 1
It's a balance, though, because we like to make the floor a little bit uneven, maybe an eighth of an inch between panels. And there's also little bumps on the floor. These little hellraisers pop up. And that prevents people from overplaying the ground game, which so many robots do nowadays. They'll have a razor-sharp front wedge just to get underneath you. If we had a perfectly smooth floor, I think these smart- Everybody would do the same thing. It would be homogenized. That would be the full game. Exactly. You got to add that randomness to it. But the speed's fantastic as long as you can control it. This season, we have Claw Viper, which is a grappler bot, which I think can go to across 40 feet in half a second, the length of the box. It's insane. It's got magnets that suck it to the battle box floor.

[01:13:20.930] - Speaker 3
What's the floor made out of for magnets to stick? Steel.

[01:13:24.680] - Speaker 1
A little paint on top, which might screw it up a little bit, depending on the thickness, but steel.

[01:13:28.900] - Speaker 3
Do the The participants know the details? They'll know it has to work on a wood floor, for example. I need to build a different bot for the conditions.

[01:13:39.540] - Speaker 1
Yeah, more or less.

[01:13:41.380] - Speaker 2
We put the shelf in without telling the participants. We surprised to when they-What's the shelf? The shelf is that new feature, that upper deck.

[01:13:48.360] - Speaker 3
Which has the- The screws pushed out.

[01:13:51.990] - Speaker 2
They weren't real happy about that because there's two entrapment spots now on the sides that they don't like.

[01:13:57.730] - Speaker 3
But both sides have the same... Yes.

[01:14:00.470] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's not like- Bias is certain... Oh, I see. A full body spinner or a horizontal spinner has to really spin up that weapon quickly, and they better not get trapped in those short corners. Otherwise, without a fully up to speed weapon. Otherwise, they're super vulnerable back there.

[01:14:17.790] - Speaker 2
It's got its advantage.

[01:14:18.840] - Speaker 1
They bug us for, Give me the specs of the sawblaze slot so I won't get stuck in them. Give me the specs for this and this, this. We give it to them so they can retool and re-engineer to not get as stuck as maybe they would have in a previous season.

[01:14:33.650] - Speaker 3
Do you guys have to remain impartial or do you root for certain robots at certain times?

[01:14:38.320] - Speaker 1
Inside, definitely. Rooting outside, just have to remain impartial.

[01:14:42.010] - Speaker 3
Why would it matter if you were partial?

[01:14:44.380] - Speaker 1
It doesn't matter. I mean, just because it's a TV show and there's the specter of, like I said earlier, of people think, just because we're so used to reality show and politics, people think there's shenanigans going on in everything. But I think Trey and I both want at some point don't want a launcher to win the damn fight, the giant nut.

[01:15:03.600] - Speaker 2
Every time somebody wins with whatever style they have, it changes the playing field. When an uppercutter wins, everybody builds an uppercutter. When a tombstone wins, everybody builds a tombstone. This year, when you see who wins, there's going to be a lot of people copping that robot because that's what they do. We've always loved flippers. Flippers are great. They're great eye candy. They're great to see when they're live and you see like 250 pounds.

[01:15:29.310] - Speaker 3
Yeah, when they really That guy is so cool.

[01:15:31.760] - Speaker 1
Slamming against the wall. Hydrobronco are so cool watching live. This is what they can do.

[01:15:35.950] - Speaker 3
Tell me about the mindset of going in. Let's say you were going to make a new bot. Tell me, where does the thinking begin?

[01:15:44.560] - Speaker 2
So Lawn machine was our first bot. Our second bot was Ginsu. Ginsu was the saw blades for wheels. Ginsu could kill you in seconds. It not only would take your leg off, but you'd be dead. It's one of those robots you look at you are afraid of just because of what you see.

[01:16:02.600] - Speaker 3
It's basically a circular saw robot. It's a circular saw that can chase you across the room.

[01:16:09.860] - Speaker 2
And Super Ginsu, the blades are this big. They are massive. You look at Nightmare. That's a robot you look at it and that could kill me within a second, and I would have no memory of it ever again. No memory ever again. Those are robots that are interesting because they come with a mindset where you look at tombstone. Yeah, okay, maybe it could kill... Or a better one would be witch doctor.Witch.

[01:16:36.160] - Speaker 3
Doctor, you know.It looks fun.

[01:16:37.500] - Speaker 2
It looks fun, and it tosses robots around, and it's a very great robot against other robots, but it's probably not going to kill me. It might, but it's probably not unless it got me in a certain spot or a certain way. So there's a mental part of it. Can you build a robot that looks like if I was going to throw a robot in to stop somebody from hurting me or take it to war, Ginsu is the robot I take because you roll that out there, people are running, where some of these other ones, although they make great fighting robots. So what would I make?

[01:17:12.100] - Speaker 1
I don't know. I think jumping has been not even utilize jumping. Bouncing. Yeah. No one's built a jumper yet. It'd be cool to see something hop and then something pops out of it.

[01:17:25.620] - Speaker 3
So you're not thinking in terms of, this is what I think will win. Where you're thinking, this is something I'm curious to see.

[01:17:32.360] - Speaker 1
There's multiple mindsets. There's the mindset of I want to win, and then you study everything that's one. And a lot of those people will wind up building a vertical spinner with four wheels, of which Dr. Hypershark, bite force, end game, clone with a little bit of their own pizazz thrown on top of it. Then there's the people who say, I want to break the meta. I want to do something totally different. Their mind goes into the creative mode. Then you get the huges, you get the mammoths, you get what else? You get even a tantrum, which is a vertical spinner, but it punches. We always tell people, we like the meta robots, the ones that do well, that's fine, but always try to come up with a new twist on the tried and true weapon systems that everyone's been using. If you're going to do a vertical spinner, do something different with it. Tantrum did that, for instance.

[01:18:15.970] - Speaker 3
Can you imagine someone coming up with a new robot that beats all of the past winners?

[01:18:23.620] - Speaker 1
Maybe, yeah.

[01:18:24.960] - Speaker 2
It's possible. When we look at some of the new ideas that we end up letting in the past, sometimes you go, Well, that looks like it can do something.

[01:18:32.380] - Speaker 1
We just saw a new design the other day for potential season eight. That's really interesting. Totally different than anything we've ever seen before. So that might come to proving grounds.

[01:18:41.400] - Speaker 3
Someone might come up with a breakthrough design that nobody thought of before, and it may work in a way in the practical world that's unexpected.

[01:18:51.720] - Speaker 1
100 %. What we're seeing a lot of... Back in the day, we saw weapon types get invented. So back in the day, you'd see, oh, my God, someone did a horizontal spinner. Now they change it to a vertical spinner. Now they change it to a drum. Now someone did a flipper. Now they did a hydraulic flipper. So there'd be these weapons would be invented. Now we've seen most of the weapons. There's probably still something that someone hasn't come up with yet, but now you see the refinement. You do the vertical spinner that's got the tooth on it, that's off center, and that punches them up and they go, you do the vertical spinner that's off access. You do the vertical spinner with a flywheel, which is Ripperoni this season. You do those refinement. Or they perfect it like blip.

[01:19:33.390] - Speaker 2
Blip is a wedge with the flipping mechanism. But how he made that mechanism work is where the technology is. It just has so much more power than anything we'd like it before. So much more power. And the idea is from a trevage. So ancient technology moved in the future and just spectacular implementation of the entire idea.

[01:19:54.650] - Speaker 3
So cool.

[01:19:55.500] - Speaker 2
My wife wants to make the bionic bouncing boob, which is basically a that with spikes on it that just bounces, has an offset weight in it and drive it.

[01:20:05.260] - Speaker 1
There's got to be some jump. See, no one's done jumping. We got to have a jumping.

[01:20:08.270] - Speaker 2
We allow flying and all that. So you could make something that flies. We had a couple of bots that were, one was lighter near head balloons on it. That didn't work real well. We had a guy that showed up a couple of years with the robot never competed, but it was supposed to float above the ground or fly above the ground. Oh, yeah. We've had people come with drones and flamethrowers and that thing, but none of that It's all one-hit wonders at this point. Flying is an interesting idea, going from above and trying to-Do any use treads, like tank treads instead of-Oh, yeah.

[01:20:41.090] - Speaker 1
One of the bots in the live show is Diablo, which is a treaded bot. We'll probably see some tread bots next year. Emulsifier in the new season is a treaded bot. It's interesting because sometimes treads is a fantastic way to outmaneuver your opponent, and other times it slips and slides, and you're screwed. You're stuck in one place from slipping and sliding. That's the new game with treads. Like, okay, now do I have to put nails in the treads to get more grip, or what do I got to do? People have figured it out with the wheels. Now they got to figure out with the treads.

[01:21:12.490] - Speaker 3
There's always this- What was the breakthrough with the wheels?

[01:21:15.220] - Speaker 1
The wheels has been people do everything from putting tennis balls inside of them. I've seen people put Coca-Cola on them. I've seen just getting the right tread, like an all-weather tire you would have. People do it. Like, Hypershark has an interesting tread profile. But it's also, obviously, the motors and gear boxes attached to them to get the right torque on the tire itself from the get-go. All kinds of stuff.

[01:21:39.050] - Speaker 2
Our participants have wheel fetishes. Yes. I had no idea. When we had the participants build these robots for our live show. We had witch doctor build five witch doctors and stuff. I said, okay, let's try to use as many of the same motors as we can so I don't need to stock all these different motors and this stuff. I never thought the wheels were going to be an issue. I thought, oh, we're They're just going to use all the same wheels or whatever. Everybody's got their own wheels. They want their own wheels and can't change the wheels because it's a look in their thing. And so I had no idea there were so many wheels fetages. It's cool. Yeah.

[01:22:10.800] - Speaker 1
Kind of cool. Yeah. Hypershark will emblaize in their tires with their logo. Yeah. I mean, they're cool stuff. Yeah. Cool.

[01:22:17.760] - Speaker 3
Is there anything else that I should know about this sport that I don't know?

[01:22:21.530] - Speaker 2
I would say, most important thing is come and see it first-hand. Come and see it first-hand. It is totally different than what you see on television. You got to It comes to both. The live show is great. It's entertainment. The TV shooting is phenomenal because of the energy.

[01:22:37.140] - Speaker 3
What would it take to have a live show that could go on the road?

[01:22:41.640] - Speaker 2
So the box that we presently have is designed to be a portable box. It's designed to be moved, to set up and torn down. And that's what it was done. That's how we did the event in the past. We go to Long Beach, set it up, hold the vent, take it down. So it's portable. The problem is now is the robots have gotten so tough that we really need to reinvent this box and make it more of a permanent box. But when we do that, we'll have our old box that will be ready to go portable again. The biggest issue with going on the road is the cost of setting up the battle box. The battle box, it takes a while, takes time, takes a lot of manpower. It's very heavy, fits in 18 trucks.

[01:23:20.130] - Speaker 3
Is there any venue that would be safe where you wouldn't need the box?

[01:23:26.210] - Speaker 1
Not with people around. No way? No way. I mean, I had this dream of doing it out in the Salt Plats with the audience watching. But if you watch virtually, it's not there. You got to see it.

[01:23:38.700] - Speaker 2
When this stuff slams in the glass in front of you and you just go, oh.

[01:23:43.190] - Speaker 1
We get this thing all the time. People, when they come see it live, they're like, oh, my God, I can't believe how big they are because TV shrinks everything. That's why you got to come see the thing live because you'll smell it. You'll feel it in your bones. The arena will shake, the motors, you'll hear it. It's the five senses on alert when the hair's in the back of your neck. You only get that from the live experience. I can't wait. It's cool.

[01:24:08.460] - Speaker 3
It sounds great.

[01:24:08.920] - Speaker 1
Yeah. Battlebots. Com/tickets. I have to plug it. I apologize.

[01:24:14.170] - Speaker 3
Battlebots. Com/tickets? Yes.

[01:24:16.520] - Speaker 1
Great.

[01:24:18.250] - Speaker 3
Cool, man. Well, thank you guys so much for coming and doing it.

[01:24:21.160] - Speaker 1
Thank you for having us. It's been a lot of fun.

[01:24:22.250] - Speaker 3
We're fans.
