Phil Jackson


(Time:  0:00)




Yeah, I saw a little bit of your interview with Anderson Cooper, was it?  



Yeah.



It just so happened it almost coincidently picked up Scott Moyers had sent your book and we discussed it a little bit, and then that Sunday I think you were on 60 Minutes, which I never watch.  I never watch 60 Minutes.



And you just happened to catch it?



Yeah.  



Amazing. 



It was.  I saw your NYU dorm and the whole bit, which is good.  It was a good backdrop.  I was like, okay, this is a kid from New York City, NY.



Normally I sit there.



I wish I could sit and have lotus and I could . . .  it’s not very comfortable.  So I watched the Avett Brothers.



They’re great.



Doing their . . . beautiful song that the younger brother did.  



No Hard Feelings?



Yeah, it’s a beautiful song.  Remarkable.  And I watched that video they did.  The documentary on them.  It was shot here, so I kind of had a visual of what your property looked like.  Which is beautiful.  It’s a great setting.

This is the chapel.  That was mostly shot in the building up above and then this used to be a guesthouse.  When I bought the place, this was a guesthouse when The Band owned it, it was a guesthouse.  And then I tore down the guesthouse and replaced it with a chapel, and then put the studio in the chapel.  I thought a recording studio is a chapel is more interesting than a recording studio in a guesthouse.  



I can see the influence of the chapel up there.  



And it’s a black burned wood chapel.  I don’t know what it means, but I just thought it was interesting.  



Would The Band members have built that?  The chapel? 



No, it was just a little guesthouse here.  Same footprint, but it was just a little house.



So what inspired you to do a podcast?

So what inspired you to do a podcast?  



I started originally five years ago, Malcolm Gladwell, who does a great podcast called Revisionist History, which I love, said he was going to start a music podcast and wanted to know if I was interested.  It was like, I love what you do, I’d love to do anything with you.  I was just excited because it was him and I was a fan, and I was a fan of what he was doing.  If I was gonna start one, it probably wouldn’t have been about music just because that’s my work life and this is more fun, you know.  Because it was Malcolm’s idea, I thought it would be fun to try.  So I did that for five years and it was great, and then I realized I like talking to all kinds of people, so maybe it’s better if I do it this way where I can get to talk to you.  



Yep.  



And it’s a brand new version of that.  It’s a continuation because the format’s the same, but before it was only talking to musicians.  



I listened to one of Malcolm’s with Vince Gill doing Up On the Mountain, the funeral of George Jones when he sang with Tammy Wynette I think it was.  And Malcolm did a whole to do on that emotional funeral memorial service they had for George Jones.  



I haven’t heard that one, it sounds great.

You know, Vince is a talented guitar player and his song that he wrote is a beautiful song, but it was an emotional . . . you could tell the emotion and the music, it was beautifully done.  I think I heard it on an airplane.  Probably the last commercial flight I’ve flown.  I just don’t fly commercial anymore.  



Since . . . 


PJ	Since the basketball world.  




I see, why not.



I took a flight with my family, I have a big family, 22 kids and grandkids, 11 grandkids.  We went down to Mexico; Cuixmala, Mexico three or four years ago.  That’s the last commercial flight I took.  I think I listened to that podcast on the flight or the broadcast that was on, accessible by the airplane.  So .  .  .



Tell me what you want.



I’m just going to reach for this bottle of water so I have access to it.



Anytime you need anything, let me know.  And feel free to say anything, and if you say anything you don’t like, we cut it out.  We are free.  There’s no . . . I’m not a journalist, I’m looking for what’s real for each of us.  I want to know what’s real for you.

Oh, about Vince Gill?  No, that was it.  But Malcolm did the whole thing about, this is country music.  Something maybe I didn’t think was his genre, but he really gave it some essence.



He’s a really good journalist.  



The emotions.



He can find the story in things in an amazing way.  It’s funny talking to you because I’m a fan and I’m not a fan of basketball.  I’m a fan of what you do, I don’t know any other coaches.  I know Pat Riley’s name because sometimes I would see pictures of him sitting opposite you, but that’s as much as I know about basketball.  



Right.



But I’m interested in coaching and I’m interested in people doing their best work.



That’s what you do, you coach.



It feels like, but I don’t know.  It’s hard to me to know because I don’t really know any coaches and I don’t know how it works, but it feels like it’s certainly related if it’s not the same and I wanted to compare notes.



Good enough, that’s a perfect entry.  Yeah, you know, my dad was a minister.  My mom was a minister.

Both of them.  Attended the same bible school in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Back in the 20’s.  That dates us.  A hundred years ago.  They were moved by this charismatic movement that went across the country, the United States.  My dad was a dairy farmer, my mom was young, she just come out of a teaching, one-room schoolhouse teaching in Montana.  So I was born into this family, a sister and two brothers; four of us.



Where were you in the four?



I was the youngest.  



Youngest.



So I was a war baby, at the end of the war baby in ’45, not a baby boomer in ’46, but you know it was an interesting time.  People coming out of depression, out of poverty that came out of The Depression, and the West was hamstrung really by the Dust Bowl, loss of jobs, farmers losing their land and so forth.



People don’t know about the Dust Bowl anymore, but was it three years where basically the sun didn’t shine essentially?

It was just drought and wind.  My mom, who grew up there . . . my dad didn’t grow up in the West, my dad grew up in Ontario, Canada.  Really on the Quebec border, Ottawa River, and migrated out to marry my mom and even though they’d both gone to the seminary in Winnipeg, Manitoba, that was by chance and choice because there weren’t a whole lot of charismatic seminaries at that time.  So anyway, he came out west and loved it.  Loved Montana and the open spaces.



Where did he come from?

of charismatic seminaries at that time.  So anyway, he came out west and loved it.  Loved Montana and the open spaces.



Where did he come from?  



He came from (Wesbeith), Ontario, which is a thumb that sticks into the Ottawa River.  His family had migrated from what was Massachusetts during the Revolutionary War.  They were Tories, loyalists.  They went to Nova Scotia and then they got a land grant for losing their land in what became Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  At that time the Commonwealth of Massachusetts incorporated that land, Portsmouth.  But my mom growing up, she was from the Mennonite faith and her parents had migrated in 1902 from Minnesota to Saskatchewan and she was born there in ’07.  Then they had the epidemic that was devastating, the Spanish Flu, which it was called which took three of her five cousins.  They went together as a married couple, my Grandpa Funk and my Uncle Reimer, they’re German Mennonites.  The Reimer’s lost three of their five kids to this epidemic and they gave it up and went back and homesteaded in Montana.


(10 minutes)



But the story I was going to tell, my mom would tell about the locusts coming through and would strip the clothesline of clothes and take the tails off the horses and the manes, and just eat everything.  Strip the land and they called them the Rocky Mountain locust invasion.




That’s wild.  It’s biblical.

It really is.  And they felt that way.  I’m trying to remember, The Day of the Locust, who wrote that book?  Are you familiar with this book?



I know the book, I can’t remember who wrote it.



I want to say West.  Anyway, it’s a really interesting book and that was a plague that went on and I don’t know how they eradicated it, but it was devastating.  People were stripped of land and stripped of an income.  It was a hard life.  My mom and her siblings, when they were old enough, they left the homestead in Oswego.  There’s an Oswego, New York too.  Oswego, Montana, which is about 35 people, and went into a town called Wolf Point and their pop got a tar paper shack for them to live in.  They had a coal burning stove, some traps and a bag of potatoes, and the four of them went to school.  Junior high or secondary school.  They ended up getting an education in a very rural area of a town of about 3,500 people in a little old town.  But that’s kinda hard scrabble life that they came out of.  It was interesting to be born into a family that was do-it-yourself people.  They could do it.  The could whatever was necessary to survive.  



So they left the Mennonite faith, is like Amish, similar?



Very similar.



So it’s a strict faith in very much outside of the mainstream.

Very disciplined.  Farmers.  They were historically, I know the background.  They were (Dikers).  They left the lowland, (Develins), at the behest of Peter the Great and went to Prussia, which was owned or run by Russia at that time and damned a river that they created or created the land, there was a swamp of a river that was there.  And eventually moved down to Moldavia where they did the same for a big lake, a large lake down in Moldavia, and then Catherine ran them out.  The pogrom ran them out in 1855 or so and they came to Minnesota.  They migrated to Minnesota.  My mom went back there during the migration from Canada Saskatchewan to Montana.  She went back to Minnesota with her grandparents and went to a German speaking school, Mennonites were there.  



But then after the tragedy, they left their faith and then they found faith again.



When they moved out of the Mennonite community in Saskatchewan, which was really a movement of a number of young people, they were just 21 and 20, my grandparents, when they moved up there and this charismatic Mennonite guy said let’s build a community of our own.



It was still a Mennonite . . . the new version was Mennonite as well.



Rosthern, Saskatchewan is still a Mennonite community.

If you were a hockey fan, there is a great hockey player named Toews, played for the Chicago Blackhawks, and that’s a Mennonite name.  That’s one of the Mennonite areas up there.  That’s a similar name.  They’re named Dikes, they were Dikers and they just got the name attached to them as Dikes.  They were relatives.  So anyway, when they came back to the States and homesteaded, they went to the closest thing to their religion, which was Lutheran, which is just a Protestant church.  But then in Roaring ‘20’s when the Jazz Age came through and everybody was Charleston and jitterbug and all those things were going on, and jazz became really . . . there was a whole kind of similar movement to the ‘60’s maybe.  And a charismatic wave came across the country.  People that these revivals that spiritually renewed them.  Both my parents were caught up in them.  My dad was a Methodist and they eventually developed a church that was developed in the mid 20’s, ’27 or ’28 called Assemblies of God and Church of God.  There were two of them that formed and the Assemblies of God is what my parents were part of.  So my dad was moved every five years, built a church, built a parsonage, knew all the things to do, and then eventually became the superintendent of the State of Montana, which is a massive state, and I grew up there.  After he spent his four years there, he went back to being a pastor and moved out of the state so the new guy could have whatever he had to do.  They moved the headquarters from Great Falls to Billings.  So I grew up in junior high and high school in a town called Williston, North Dakota.  Where the Williston Oil Basin is, which is a big thing now.

What was life like in your family.  Being the youngest and both of your parents ministers, would you consider it a strict upbringing?  



Oh my God.  (laughs)



The strictest?  



We didn’t have a television.  I mean, just to let you know.  Everything’s secular.  We had newspaper . . . what else did we get?  Readers Digest.  My dad bought World Book Encyclopedias.  I was an avid reader.



What subjects did you like to read about?



Well I read the classics, which you were given as a kid.  What to read.



Literature?



Yeah, literature.  I started off with Natty Bumppo and the Last of the Mohicans, Pathfinder, Hawthorne’s books, and you know, things that are interesting to boys.  Chipper Hilton, the athletic prowess of a guy who played all the sports in New York, actually Long Island Blackbirds, the Long Island . . . what’s the college out there?  



Hofstra?



No, it’s LIU, it’s the name of the school.  Clair Bee was the coach and he wrote these books about Chipper Hill that were in all junior high school libraries.  Playing basketball, playing football, playing baseball.  Anyway, you know I played all those sports and I excelled at sports.



You excelled at all sports?  You were just a good athlete.

You excelled at all sports?  You were just a good athlete.



Yeah, I played quarterback until my best friend, who ended up getting a tryout with the Green Bay Packers, took over as the quarterback and they moved me to end, the split end.  We had a pro offense, but I was developing all the way through.  I mean I was 6 foot as a sophomore in high school.  I made the varsity team and the next year I was 6’ 5”.  It was like that.  So I didn’t stop growing until I was a sophomore in college or more, maybe junior.  So it was one of those things.  


But the home life, my brother, who is six years older than I am, brought in rock and roll music.  He had a little record player, 45’s, and if he played it in his room, my mom and dad were okay with it, but it wasn’t allowed in the house, that type of thing.  




That’s cool though that they let him hear . . . they didn’t shut him down.



Right.  Dancing, alcohol, smoking, etc. were off limits.

It’s erotic.  You get aroused dancing.  You’re close to . . . . you know, contact.  Well how about a jitterbug, Mom?  Well, I know.  You know that I did the Charleston back in the 20’s when I was a kid growing up, but literally that’s kind of frenetic and maybe too exciting.  Yeah, but people dance in the holy spirit in the church and they get under the power of the holy spirit.  So we went back and forth.  My mom was a great debater and she loved to listen, and she liked to hear us challenge, so that was a good deal.  



Do you feel like, even though you ended up leaving your parents’ faith behind, it still had a big impact on your life.  The fact that you had it when you had it.

Oh, without a doubt.  There’s such a feeling of emotion that rolls through a congregation and my mom spoke in the evening service, which is more of an evangelical service and my dad spoke in the morning, as more of a pastor.  But yet there was these emotional surges that would go through the audience, the congregation, various speakers would come in.  You very much got a feeling of the move of the Holy Spirit, that was the term used.  In my early years, I heard about the Shekinah glory when the Old Testament . . . Elijah and Elisha were moved by.  So that was a big part of our experiences, to be emotionally involved with religion.  To have a personal relationship with God.  It was impressed upon us to the point where my dad used to say, well the Catholic says that if we can have a child until he’s 6, he’ll be a Catholic his whole life.  He said we feel the same way about our faith, if we can have a child until the age of 6 or 7, it will influence their whole life.  It did.  Even though I went to college and immediately was assaulted by things that challenged my belief; evolution, a variety of things that we were taught in science and elsewhere.  Ended up leaving a pre-law type of direction for philosophy, psychology and religion.  Those were my major minors and I had a composite major because I was still a searcher.  I continue to be.

for philosophy, psychology and religion.  Those were my major minors and I had a composite major because I was still a searcher.  I continue to be.



I was a philosophy major and then I switched to film and television just because I was also on the track to go to law school and it did matter what your undergraduate degree was in, and all of my friends were in film and television, and it just seemed like more fun.  So if it didn’t matter to get where I was going, I might as well have more fun.  That’s why I switched.  So I have a degree in film and television with a minor in philosophy, but was a searcher as well.  Same.  



The department in North Dakota where I went back and got a, you know, honorary doctorate 10 years ago or so, they took me to the place where Benjamin Ring, my philosophy instructor, my advisor, had left and they dropped the philosophy department.  That’s how far liberal arts had fallen from choice.  Philosophy is still there, the philosophy department, psychology department obviously, but the religious department is gone and the philosophy department is limited to just one guy.  No more department.  So the changes from liberal arts are from seeking has been more specific to technological training or whatever, scientific training.



That’s interesting.  I think the big ideas are still just as interesting as they were when we were younger.

The idea that you were given this introduction to Western Civilization when you went to your freshman year of college.  You learned about Plato and Socrates and know thyself, that was the whole goal about this pursuit, is to know yourself.  The idea that that’s still the pursuit that we’re on as individuals is really a never ending pursuit for us, the people that are seekers.  The people that want to evolve.  



Would you say for the most part, even though it has changed, has your spiritual life continued from childhood to now in an equally strong way?



Yeah, the morning we had what was called devotions and we had to be downstairs at 7:30 if we left for school at 8:30 and whatever, school was 9, 8:45.  We were downstairs at 7:30 and we read a scripture from the bible.  We usually were pursuing some form or fashion of a storyline in the bible.  And then we prayed.  And we got on our knees to pray.  We didn’t sit at the table and fold our hands and bow our heads.  We got on our knees to pray because that was how we did it.  To this day, I sit in the morning and meditate.  So it’s the same thing, basically.

I think it might be fair to say that it doesn’t really matter the path you take to get there, they all can share the same power. We’re all looking for the same thing, regardless of which stream we choose to get there.  I don’t know that there’s a right way to do it.



No doubt.  You know, I have a brother that has Parkinson’s disease.  He’s in a care facility now who’s a Sufi.



Beautiful.  



Yeah, and that was typical of kind of where the Pentecostal faith was because a lot of it is about music and about being in rhythm, and about the emotional aspect.  And the Sufi’s is the same function within the Muslim faith or Islamic faith.  The dancing and the twirling.

Yeah, it’s really something.  So yeah, he’s a Sheikh eventually in the Sufi faith, which is a healer.  He was a therapist in real life, which he carried into his therapy.  My oldest brother passed away a couple years ago, well two years ago this April.  Became an agnostic.  He got Hodgkin’s, non-lymphoma Hodgkin’s, and went through a period where he lost like 40 pounds and went through a whole thing that revitalized him and lived another 10 years afterwards, but during that period of time he lost his faith.  He lost his belief in God.  He found that he couldn’t find his pathway there.  He was a guy that was Don Juan, Carlos Castaneda, that whole Seth Speaks.  That group of seekers that were, you know, looking more for . . . I would call it . . . spirits.  More evidence of supernatural spirits than . . . which we call people that (Siv), or just the source, or the natural being.  And you know, we’re sitting here doing this, I was thinking on my way down to see you or up I should say to see you, that I’ve sat with a number of people, therapists and film people, and we’ve talked about the flow.  About being in the spirit, being in the moment.  And that is really what is the joy that brings people together, and that’s the binding force that makes these religions happen.  That’s terrific.  Can’t capture it.  It’s impossible.  I have to say you can’t make a film about this, that’s not gonna happen.

.  That’s terrific.  Can’t capture it.  It’s impossible.  I have to say you can’t make a film about this, that’s not gonna happen.  


(30 minutes)




As soon as you turn that on, it doesn’t translate.  It’s in the moment.  In fact, my teacher would say it’s before the moment, it’s the moment before the moment.  



Beautiful.



You can almost anticipate it because it’s there before it happens.



So would say that the unity of a team playing well together is a spiritual event?

Oh, without a doubt.  It hooks you on sports when you’re a kid.  All of a sudden, you just have that feeling.  I was fortunate because almost everything I did was successful, and I had great teammates and great experience in playing sports in both the high school and college level, and professional level too.  Having been on three teams that went to championships, two of the one, the finals in the NBA, and having the experience as a mentor, a coach, a teacher; for all the championships and bowls and the Lakers were able to win.  So you sit there and enjoy, and people always ask me, why aren’t you up and about like a lot of coaches are up and down the floor, and yelling.  I said well, you kind of learn that if you teach and coach, you trust the players to do what’s supposed to be done on the floor.  Then you can sit back and join that feeling that they’re experiencing out there.  You’ll know when the time is right to say timeout, let’s get together and talk.  It was a vicarious experience.  Not playing, not in the band, but still participating in a different way.

say timeout, let’s get together and talk.  It was a vicarious experience.  Not playing, not in the band, but still participating in a different way.



Yeah, that’s again, closer to my experience.  I usually don’t play in the band, I’m usually on the sidelines, but it feels great to feel that energy.  I feel like I’m part of that circle when it happens, and it’s a miraculous thing because it can be not happening for a while, and then all of a sudden it starts happening and no one involved knows what changed.



You know, that’s the interesting thing about it.  I was thinking about coming back the final year for my . . . at the behest of players that were leaders on the team.  Let’s just do it one more time, but we couldn’t do it one more time.  It was . . .something just wasn’t right.  It just couldn’t click.  We had moments here and there, but it wasn’t . . .  it just didn’t flow the way it’s supposed to flow.  I kind of figured out what happened . . . 



It actually flowed exactly the way it’s supposed to flow, but it wasn’t the way you wanted it to flow.

I kind of figured out what happened . . . 



It actually flowed exactly the way it’s supposed to flow, but it wasn’t the way you wanted it to flow.



Exactly, this is the end of whatever it was.  But it was an interesting feeling of hmmm, what’s going on here.  How can we make this better.  That’s one of the things that I think was kind of a pivotal point of my existence now was when coaches call or get information about what should I do about . . . how to sit back.  You’ve got to be there, you have to be in it.  You can’t be about it, you’re not running it, you’re being part of it, but you . . . I’ll tell you something that I rarely have told anybody this.  That I lined the players up . . . the players know this.  I line the players up the first day of camp.  Usually we used to have this extended number of guys that would come, but the NBA wanted us to have like 20 players maximum come in and, in case there’s an injury or someone goes down, you could still have practices and then you keep cutting.  


Three days, you cut players; five days later, you cut players.  So you’re finally down to your 12.  Now the NBA has 15 guys on a team.  They just keep expanding it, but you had 12 guys.  So when the 12 were finally formed and it’s a week before the season started, I’d line them up on the baseline and then tell them, the Lord, the owner of this team, the NBA has given me the authority to coach this group of guys and we’re it.  By your own admission, by your own actions, if you agree that I will be coaching you and you’ll my accept my directions, I want you to step across the line as a physical way of expressing your obedience or your following to what we’re gonna do.  And I wanted to do that and one of my mentors, actually my coach’s assistants who was 35 years older than I was when I started coaching, he was 65; now he’s 30 years old.  Gave me that story from a freshman team that he played on at Fordham University and Vince Lombardi was the coach of the freshman basketball team.  I was like, Vince Lombardi coached basketball?  He said yeah, freshman coach.

and Vince Lombardi was the coach of the freshman basketball team.  I was like, Vince Lombardi coached basketball?  He said yeah, freshman coach.  




Amazing.



And that’s when he said God, Fordham and the president of this college . . .



It’s such a funny list.



I said it’s a perfect thing.  Because you want the players to follow and to be able to submit to coaching.  If you get resistance and then it becomes a thing, it falls apart.  But if you like okay, we’re in this together, you’ve agreed to do this and I’m gonna hold you to it.



In the years of doing it, did anyone not step over the line?  



No.  There’s a force of okay, I’m in with him, but there are definitely guys that had trouble.  They used to say if you can keep 10, 11 and 12 from associating with 6, 7 and 9 on the bench, so they don’t form a unity . . . that was a baseball player actually named Lintz.  He said that about the Yankees.  If you can keep those guys that are unhappy about not playing from the guys that are partially or bench players, so they don’t form a union, you’re in good shape.  Because the starters are all happy, they’re out there playing.  They could not like their role, but that was kind of the only thing.


I played everybody.  Maybe I wouldn’t get the 12th guy in, but then at the end of the game I’d go around the locker room and say,  guys, I’m sorry I couldn’t get you in the ballgame.  They all want to play.

Not knowing anything about basketball, which I said to you earlier, can you tell me a little bit about the hierarchy of a team.  There’s the owner of the team and then there’s the general manager?



Uh huh.



And then there’s the coach?



Right.



And then there are the players.  Did I miss any steps?



There’s a myriad of also’s in between there.  An owner has to be compliant with what you’re going to do.  Fortunately for me, I had owners that stepped aside.  Owners wouldn’t come in the locker room, they’d address the team at the end of the season or at the Christmas party, and that was it.  I had to remove general managers from the locker room occasionally because there was something intimate that was going on in the group that had to be discussed.



Would the general manager be the person who originally hires you or no?


PJ	Usually, well in some cases the owner does.  It was forced around in the Laker organization that the owner was the one who dictated who to hire.  The other situation, my other team that I was with, the Chicago Bulls, it was the general manager that went to the owner and said it’s time that we hire this guy.




And when you were a Knick, how did the hierarchy work?

as the general manager that went to the owner and said it’s time that we hire this guy.




And when you were a Knick, how did the hierarchy work?  



Well, our general manager, Eddie Donovan . . . I’m trying to remember the college he came out of, outside of Buffalo, a Catholic college he came out of.  He was hired as a coach, but he didn’t have success, so they made him a general manager because he was a really likable guy and he had pretty good direction.  He had two colleagues that were coach and scout.  The scout would stay with the team as assistant coach until college basketball started.  My first year in New York in ’67, we had three players that were first-year players on that team.  Walt Frazier and Bill Bradley.


(40 minutes)



Bill Bradley had to serve in the reserves before he could come.  He’d been a Rhodes Scholar and when he signed up he was under 6’ 6”, which was the max 6’ 5”, so he had to serve in the Vietnam War.  So he went in the reserves and they put him in the six-month training or whatever, so he didn’t start with us.  



The coach was replaced two weeks after Bill finally got back and joined the New York Knick team in December, which was deeper in the season than it is now.  It’s like 25 games now and at that time we started in the middle of October.  Baseball had no playoffs.  Baseball was over in October.  So anyway, the replacement coach was the scout.  His name was Red Holzman.  Red had scouted all of us, so he knew all of us intimately in our game.  So it was, you know, took off running.  Best record in the next part of the year from that point on.  However, the next season, we didn’t get off to a good start, so the general manager, Eddie Donovan, came to our training camp, our practice facility.  He fined everybody like $250, a lot of money; I was making $12,500.  So Walt was first round pick, he’d probably be making $15,000.  It was a lot of money.



It was like Phil, you and Walt, you guys don’t pay the fine because you got bandages on your knees because you’ve been on the floor fighting for the ball and whatever.  He was going off about how guys aren’t hustling and that’s how he got to it.  Our players association representatives, Walter “The Bell” Bellamy, said Mr. General Manager, sir, we have no showers that’ll last after the second shower, it turns cold.  There’s a hole in our practice facility floor in the corner over there.  We were playing on wooden backboards in the Moss Battalion Amory on 52nd Street and Queens Boulevard.  What do you expect from us?  I mean we don’t even have duffle bags, we have croaker sacks.  Well you know what a croaker sack is?  It’s what the cotton pickers put the cotton balls in.  We have croacker sacks.  



That did it for Eddie Donovan and he turned into a fountain of spittle and invectives, and eventually in a month, Walter Bellamy was gone to another team.  There were a couple of instances that created that because he didn’t get off the bench to fight in an overall brawl that we had somewhere later in that initial season.

instances that created that because he didn’t get off the bench to fight in an overall brawl that we had somewhere later in that initial season.  




Was fighting more common then also?



Yeah.



Wow.



That change turned the whole franchise around.  Because we got a player named Dave DeBusschere, whose name . . . Dave the Butcher I always called him.  And Dave came and all of sudden Willis Reed who was the forward became the center and for seven years we had high success.  We were on the flow, in the moment, and because of that Eddie Donovan moved on and went to the new franchise of Buffalo, New York, which was just starting off, an expansion team.  Our coach Red Holzman became the general manager, so he became both the general manager and the coach.



Was he the person who scouted you and brought you in and ends of coaching you; that’s great.



And they’re paying me.

Everyone has.  I have two coaches who are Hall of Fame coaches, Bill Fitch in college, who ended up winning with the Boston Celtics in the NBA.  He was a charismatic guy.  And Red Holzman is a Hall of Fame coach.  More than anything, I lend to kind of recite some of the things about Red Holzman that I learned.  Red carried a Wal-Mart, not Wal-Mart, Woolworth watch in his shirt pocket and he’d say, see this watch, this is a $2.95 watch.  I have to wind it every 24 hours and this is our time, this is our timekeeper.  If you’re 5 minutes late, we’ll hold the bus, you’ll get fined, but if you’re more than 5 minutes late, the bus will be gone, the plane will be gone.  Practice will have started and you’ll be fined more than just a silly fine, which is the first 5 minutes, which could be $10, whatever.  A little fee.


So when he’d have an issue with you, said something in the paper he thought wasn’t team oriented or whatever.  He’d say step into my office and we’d step into the bathroom.  This is my office.  Okay, anybody in here?  Ok, let’s talk about what you just said or whatever was going on.  So there’s a certain demeanor, don’t get too high, don’t get too low.  We started off with a bang the next year.  We won 18 in a row.  The 19th game we lost.  Red, what are you going to do, you know, you lost.  Well, I’ll do the same thing when we won last night.  I’ll go home, Selma will cook me a steak, I’ll have a scotch, sit down, watch the Tonight Show and get up in the morning, go back to work.  Don’t get too high, don’t get too low.  Middle man.  He was a Buddhist.

ork.  Don’t get too high, don’t get too low.  Middle man.  He was a Buddhist.  




Wow.  Was he really a Buddhist or he just was a middle path guy.



He was a middle path guy.  But he was a pleasure to work with.  His demeanor was . . . let me give you an example.  Cazzie Russell, a famous player.  College player of the year, 1965 or ’66; Bill Bradley college player of the year 1965.  Faced off against each other, not only the holiday tournament in Madison Square Garden, but also in the Final Four in the NCAA’s.  And they subbed in for each.  Bill started, Cazzie came off the bench, which is a hard thing for Cazzie, but he struggled with it.  But he had a great demeanor.  He wanted to win and he sublimated his hard feelings.  He’s a minister now and 30 years afterward he came to Bill and said, Bill, I had really hard feelings about you starting ahead of me when you were a player and I want to ask forgiveness.  Bill was like ohh, Cazzie, I knew it was hard.  I knew about it, but we got along and we won, we replaced each other and did a good job, and have no fear, I held no grudges against you.  So that was great.


So anyway, the story I was going to tell about the demeanor of Red Holzman.  Cazzie had a couple of incidents and Red wanted everybody to be together.  We were doing this together.  We’d go to the games together, we’d ride the bus together.  To prove a point, Wilt Chamberlain lived in New York City, played for the Philadelphia Warriors, they moved to Golden State and became the Golden State Warriors, but before they moved West, he was a Philadelphia Warrior.  He lived in New York City and drove to the games.  Which is like 90 miles or whatever it is, 85 miles or something, but that would be Wilt.  He was just by himself, he was a loner.  Red didn’t want any part of that.  So we were playing in Philadelphia.  Meet at the Madison Square Garden, take the bus, get off, Dolly Madison Café rest stop on the way down, have a little something, pre-game meal, ride the rest of the way to Philadelphia, go to the game, get dressed in the locker room.  Cazzie shows up.  Oh ho, Cazzie, you drove down.  Yeah I did.  How much were the tolls at Benjamin Franklin Bridge.  I think it was $4.50 or something like that.  Deduct that from the $100 fine I’m going to give you.

(laughs)  That’s so funny.


(50 minutes)




That was his way of kinda bringing it in, bringing it in, okay this is your punishment.



Were the punishments really about the punishment or was it something else?



It was something else.



Tell me about it.



It was just about being called out and being . . . you weren’t on this thing as a teammate.  You weren’t joining in, you weren’t part of this and putting your whole self-involved in this thing.  It was a subtle way of doing it.  So it was very, very impressionable for me as a 22-year-old, 23-year-old kid.  And then I had an injury that kept me out for a full season and then I was like going to the games, but not being able to play in the game. 



What does that feel like psychologically?

out for a full season and then I was like going to the games, but not being able to play in the game. 



What does that feel like psychologically?



It’s awful.  But the thing that happened was Red was like come on, hang out with me, we’ll talk before the game and we’ll talk about it.  And in the process he was like, Phil what do you suggest we do against this team in front of the team.  Oh, yeah, I thought we should step out hard on that screen roll or whatever.  He started to rely on me as a person that could express it as a player because I think he didn’t want to have to do that.  This is a guy who never drew a diagram.  He had no boards, no chalk, no nothing.  He might be in a restaurant, he might move salt shakers and pepper shakers around.  But he never did any of that process.


There’s a guy named Digger Phelps that coached for Notre Dame for a long time, but he started out at Fordham.  There’s a Holiday Tournament in Madison Square Garden during Christmas.  They had had major teams come in, but later on it was less insightful.  Fordham was in the tournament and they were waiting to get on the court.  Very little practice time in Madison Square Garden because it’s busy all the time.  So we got to practice in the morning, be there at 10 o’clock, we got 10 to noon.  At noon Fordham had the court.  So we were doing something at the end of practice and Digger Phelps was a young 33, 34-year-old coach, said to Red Holzman, oh, I saw you running a play like we run.  Did you see us run that play on TV or something?  Red said to him, Digger this game’s been almost 90 years old.  Every play that’s ever been thought of has already been run somewhere in some schoolyard, YMCA, whatever.  I don’t think there’s anything as plays go.  We don’t have that.  We don’t do that.



So he would say to us, if you have something you think really works, bring it to practice, show us what you think will work and we’ll work on it.  If we like it, we’ll keep it.  And we’ll give it a name.  So we got something, can’t remember who got it, who brought it, but the next day or next game . . . I can’t remember whether it was a game or just after a game and practice, he said remember that play that we ran the other night at the end of the game?  That’s sequence of things, options for everybody?  Yeah.  What should we call it?  What the fuck should we call it, he said.  Oh, that’s what we’ll call it, what the fuck.  



So I coached the Lakers.  They have great success.  I run this play.  I run this play with the Bulls, I’ve run this play with the Lakers, coaches that comment on the sideline say why can’t anybody stop this play, what’s going on.  Christmas 2004, San Francisco, Shaq’s been traded.  Big deal, he’s been traded to Miami.  Miami’s playing the Lakers for a Christmas Day game.  The game’s close, at the end of the game timeout’s called, 6 seconds, 8 seconds to go in the ball game.  Kobe’s coming from the bench, he’s going, Frank tell the coach what the fuck, tell him what the fuck, he doesn’t know it, you gotta show it to him.  So the owner’s daughter, who I was in a relationship with, Jeanie Buss, called me up and said what’s he talking about.  I said that’s the name of a sequence of actions, what the fuck.  But that would be Red, he’d just find a name for something and just throw it out there.

I read in the Eleven Rings book that you just moved to the Lakers, you just came to California, new job and you meet essentially the boss’s daughter who works . . . a person you’re working with and the boss’s daughter and you’re the new guy, and you had the confidence to start dating her and it worked out great, obviously.

Yeah, appropriate workplace relationship.  I had my staff and the NBA used to have a preseason collective.  Everybody in the NBA, maybe a thousand or eight hundred people would go to a whole meeting; they’d have general managers and trainers and ticket people, everybody, coaches, etc.  Referees and the administration staff come out.  It was in Vancouver and flew up there.  I still hadn’t, I wasn’t moving into the house that I bought in Playa del Rey until October.  So it’s still whatever, training camp was going to start, we’d be on the road and then sometime in October I would move into this home.  The collective has a big meeting on Friday morning, everybody comes in and they break down into their groups and so forth.  We had this whole thing about race.  They talked to us about how the media is making it look like, there’s more crime with the black community and the players, and pro sports and the NFL, whatever.  So we get through with that and then we break up into meetings and then the evening, each individual club takes their staff out for dinner.  


So we go to dinner, ride over with my staff.  I have two of my three coaches with me and I go in there and Jeanie is hosting the dinner.  She said, you know, it’s nice to meet you, I was at your press conference a month ago.  To be honest with you, I was hoping that Kurt Rambis would get the job, but my dad insisted on you.  I’m in charge of operations at The Forum and now I moved into another job as a vice president in charge of operations.  Great.  So we have dinner with a group of trainers and personnel that are more associated with the team.  We have three tables, probably 30 people.  Leave.  The next day I go to the meeting which is a meeting with the coaching staff and I go to the airport.  Fly down because I have a daughter coming in to meet me in L. A.  I get to the airport, typical Vancouver thing, it’s raining, planes have been delayed and there’s Jeanie Buss sitting in the lobby waiting for her plane.  Oh, well, what happened to your plane?  It’s been canceled actually.  I’m on the plane that you must be on if you’re flying down there and I said yeah, okay.  Is it delayed?  Yeah, it’s delayed.  So we have about an hour to sit.



So we sat and talked for about an hour.  She was going to her birthday party and I think was turning 38 at the time.  And I said you know, do you want to sit together on the plane?  She said are you in first class?  I said yeah, she said I don’t fly first class, I fly coach.  I said okay, how come.  She said well I’m the boss’s daughter and I don’t want to do that, I want to show people . . . and I go it’s the type of thing I like.  So that’s great.  Monday comes, she’s had her party on the weekend.  She went to Benihana’s and whatnot.  It’s lunchtime and she sets down a piece of cake, birthday cake.  So I went by her office on my way out.  I’d been interviewing people and getting associated with the organization, thank her for the birthday cake.  When I walked in and said hi, thanks for the birthday cake, she blushed and went ohhh, I’ve lost it now.



(1 hour)



So I said you know, I’m by myself, do you want to go out to dinner and she said yeah.  So anyway it started out a romance and yeah, we had a great run of 15 years or so together and we use that old phrase that Hepburn used, live close and visit often, but don’t live together.  So that became kind of the deal.  We ended up actually living together about 3 years while one of her houses was being built, it was a model home that she bought into.  But that was it.  And this is wise, she was a really big help because she kind of could ferret out some of the things that go on that I would have to deal with.  Hmmm, why isn’t the commissioner coming to our championship ceremony.  Well 9/11 happened, he’s got to be in the city.  He wants to be there to support New York City.  I’ve never seen a commissioner that hasn’t handed out the rings and the trophies and everything.  Well don’t make any issue of it, okay.  So those were the kinds of things she would . . . I’m always kind of bucking against the establishment.  I’ve always been kind of an anti-establishment, but she really helped me in that regard because she is politically astute.

Would you say part of your job was an advocate for the team against everyone else.  Meaning the management, the press, anyone who wasn’t on the team, even if they were associated with the team, were you that buffer?



Yeah, and I think that’s the reason why Michael Jordan and I had such a great relationship.  I didn’t ask him for anything.  



You weren’t a company man, you were a Bulls man.  You were for the team.



I didn’t have him sign tennis shoes or bring people to meet him or do anything, it was just we have a player coach relationship and this I value more than anything else.  So that was a big deal.  I saw how he’d been held before.  We end up a lot of times on the same floor, executive level floors, and I’d see like eight hotel employees who are parked outside his room, waiting for an opportunity to get a signature, it was always on him, always on him.  I don’t know if anybody’s been . . . probably Tiger Woods I would say has been highly sought after, but that Tiger Woods’ group was entirely different than the group that was looking to find audience with Jordan.

Yeah, I had a crazy conversation a couple of weeks ago with Andre Iguodala who told me . . . and it blew my mind, that the powers that be within the organization that he plays with, and this is not the case just for the team he’s on, for all the teams that there’s so much pressure on them to be involved in . . . to spend their time doing social media and to be on camera all the time.  He said it’s a complete distraction from the game and it really gets in the way, and we want to win and they’re concerned about us doing all this other extra stuff that really gets in the way.  It sounds amazing that that could be the case.

So much so that it became like an issue for me.  I’ll tell you one of the episodes for example.  You have shoot arounds during the mighty times in the playoffs when they get tight.  You go through a conference final and then you go to the NBA final.  Your shoot around is designated.  Home team has their option, 10 or 11 in the morning, and you have to take whatever they don’t take.  So we’re playing in New York.  We’re playing the Knicks.  The Knicks are really a good team.  They’ve come up through the ranks.  We’ve traded our best power forward for their center, Bill Cartwright, who is Twin Towers with Patrick Ewing, and given up a guy names Charles Oakley because we have a young stud named Horace Grant coming along who I think can do his job, can replace him.  


So anyway, it’s loaded, we unload the stuff.  We are pressed a little bit because we lost both games to initiate the series, so we’re down 0-2 in a seven game series.  The next game coming up, rather than going to the shoot around, I take the players to the Staten Island ferry.  




Amazing.



So they take the ferry over and we just have a casual time.  



Sightseeing.

They invite us up on the top level of the ferry, whatever.  So the league fined me for not being there, which is okay, I’m alright.  I’ll absorb the fine.  The only problem was that it didn’t run smoothly as Clinton flew in, a helicopter, and then you know how the traffic goes when the President’s in town.  So we had to wait a half hour extra anyway.  But we got it done and we won the game.  We won four straight after that to win that series.  But those are the minor things that go on all the time.  You have six various meetings during the course of the year that are added on.  You have physical, urine specimens that are taken four times at the various times they surprise your team.  And there will be three or four guys that are picked out of the team that have to do the specimens.  


One time I think we had to wait an hour and a half post game because Kobe couldn’t find anything to urinate because you sweat everything out during the course of the game.




You sweat so much in the game, of course.

They’re depleted and they had to drink like three bottles of water before he could find it.  Anyway, we left on the bus and he eventually came out on his own in a cab.  You know, the amount of stuff they ask.  At one point, David Stern, who is a strong leader pulled me out and said I want you to meet Adam Silver, who is now the commissioner.  He has a proposition that at the end of the first quarter, the visiting team will meet with the press, the TV announcer, and give a little rundown and then between the third and fourth quarter, the coach of the home team will meet with an on-court reporter to give an assessment of what he sees during the course of the game.  Well I would send my assistant coaches out to do that.  I didn’t want to be part of that because that’s a distraction.



Absolutely.

He doesn’t need to have that going on.  Then they eventually reeled me in and no, we have to have you, you have to be there.  That’s the oversight, the overbearing thing that they do and I was talking to a coach recently.  I said guys have played in 65 games, there are 68 games or something like that now.  They’re bored of each other.  They’re in a pecking order that they maybe don’t like all time.  It’s like members of a band that go off.  It’s the same thing.  I said take them out to a movie.  Take them to a comedy show.  Can’t do that anymore.  I said why.  Because whatever you spend on them is against the cap.  It’s like that’s crazy.  I used to give my credit card to the team and say go have a pre-series dinner out together.  Anyway, the other thing I used to do, so the silly fines.  I told you about the fines, so here we are with players making up to $25 million, $35 million a year.  So if you come late, 5 minutes late, shoes aren’t tied, we’re at center court in a circle, don’t have your jersey on, you’re not ready to do what we’re ready to do, silly fine.  That silly fine incrementally goes from $50 until three strike and then it goes to $100.  And my assistant coach would pick up the money from your per diem, when you get your per diem.  And we’ll shoot for that money next week or two weeks from now, whatever.  So how much is in the pot, Frank?  A hundred dollars, $300, $1,000.  Okay, winners get $250 each.  We shoot for them and we have a shooting game.

Wow.



So the league said you can’t do that because that’s giving players money.  I said that’s crazy.  This is like peanuts, this is like spending money.  



And it’s such a great idea to turn a fine into an opportunity.



To get it back.



It’s such a great idea.  



It was one of those hanging fruits that they said, we just want to take this because it’s just . . .  I said if you knew how much was made in these shooting games, when you send in your syllabus or whatever you want to call it, for the season, you have to expressly designate what your fines are.  I would go like okay, some guys’ fines are $500 for being late or a thousand dollars for this, mine fines are $100, but they hate it.  They’re like whining about losing $100.  You’ll get it back if you win the shooting game.  I’ll put you on a good team.  Yeah, just to keep it lively and light is hard to do now because it’s overlord.  The players have rebelled against it in some way, but they have also complied in other ways to kind of let the league take over and have that.

I’ll take the sweater vest off.  I think creativity is something I picked up from your book, that you’re searching for creativity and as a leader or as a mentor, you’re always looking for what can I give that’s a spark to help.  In the process, I think about the players and at some point we take usually a two-week trip.  You play the other conference, there’s 7 or 8 teams in the other conference, you may play 6 or 7 of them on the road trip, you’re gone for 2 weeks.  So I’ll get on the plane, I’ll have a book for everybody.  And the book usually matches something about who you are.  Dennis Rodman, picture book of motorcycles, there, feast on that.  The art of motorcycle maintenance.  One of them that I gave away, that was a book that someone got, A Compendium to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance because it was difficult to read.  It appears the writer of that book was a coauthor of great books, which the University of Chicago put out in the 60’s.  I still have the copies of all the great books.  


Yeah, he wrote that storyline basically about how do you get totally focused on the direction you want to go and he wrote it as a parable of riding with his son, who was estranged, 13-year-old young teen kid from like Minneapolis to Bozeman, Montana.  That’s where he stopped, and he had to have his bike worked on and the guy was playing rock and roll music and he couldn’t do the right job, and he was talking about all these things, the technology that goes into  . . . At that particular point he was writing instruction manuals.  As you’ve probably noticed, a lot of the instruction manuals you go what, someone that didn’t have anything to do with this technology wrote this instruction manual that they erred on the way.  He’d say, the guy that usually can’t do the technology is the guy they say, why don’t you just go and write the instruction booklet and get out of our hair.



It was a book that I wanted one of my leaders of my team to read because he grasped the idea of what we were doing.  Like you talk about craft in your book, that’s basically one of the chapters or one of the notations that I just recently read.  We spent a lot of time, basic skills.  When I came and coached the Lakers, one of the players, Rick Fox, ran by where the coaches stand on the sideline and said, coach, I feel like I’m in the 7th grade.  I said, yeah, I know, that’s what you are, you’re getting back to those fundamentals that we had to learn when we were kids.  So we had something called skills and drills.  Teaching players how to do the various skills that they can operate inside of the function of our offense.  So it wasn’t complicated.  In fact, the brighter people were, sometimes the more they thought.  And that’s not what you’re trying to do, you’re trying to get people to instinctively react so they’re not . . . the idea of going through a thought process before you can act, too much.  You just have to act.

How much of being a great athlete is purely physical versus the mental and emotional side.



One of the great scorers in the NBA, Elvin Hayes, great battle between Elvin Hayes and Lew Alcindor at the time, was the largest crowd to ever watch a college basketball game in the Astro Dome.  The University of Houston versus UCLA.  Elvin Hayes came in the league at No. 2 pick or maybe first pick behind Wesley Unseld in ’68.  Elvin had a shot, a turnaround shot that was almost unstoppable.  Got the ball on the post, tremendous skill of leaping and he turned to his right shoulder and he banked it off the backboard.  It was just like a moneymaker.  He could make this shot.  One of my assistants inherited the Houston job when they moved from San Diego Rockets to the Houston Rockets.  He inherited that job.  He had hoped to be coaching the San Diego Rockets in his first attempt at pro coaching, and he ended up in Houston.  But Elvin Hayes was there and the skills and drills that we used, Elvin couldn’t perform.  So Tex would take him off the court and teach him individually some of the skills, and eventually it got so frustrating for Elvin that they traded him to the Washington Bullets and he won a championship there actually, one year.  


But I told the coach I never thought Elvin could win a championship because he just had this one phenomenal thing he could do because he’s such a great athlete . . . he had a little hook shot, I shouldn’t say one thing, but that was his moneymaker, that shot.  We beat them in the playoffs one time with a player, one of the great players I played with named Jerry Lucas, who . . . that team was just (feated) in Madison Square Garden by the way.  They’re honoring their championship of ’73, 50 years ago?  Jerry was there, but anyway Jerry was playing center because Willis Reed was hurt and had to have a knee operation and miss the rest of the season.  But Jerry limited Elvin Hayes.  He said, Jerry what’d you do?  He said see that hand, he’s my size, 6’ 8”, but he’s got this huge hand like a bricklayer’s I guess.  He said I just put it on his hip and I just turned him an extra 2 inches.  So now instead of shooting where he wanted to release point, he was shooting at a different release point.  He couldn’t find a way.



But that’s the intricacies of the game.  That’s where the smart guys really understand the game and those subtle things go into it.  That’s the kind of players I was fortunate to play with, those kind of players.  The coach understood that too, so I think it kind of rubbed off a little bit, especially when I had to sit out a year and I had to watch and I could see, and I could wonder what was going on that was different between this group of guys and that other group of guys which looks so talented, but somehow or another, when they’re a collective group, they couldn’t quite do it.  I’m sure you’ve seen it many times.  Great musicians come in, just can’t find the beat, can’t find the harmony, can’t put it together.

uite do it.  I’m sure you’ve seen it many times.  Great musicians come in, just can’t find the beat, can’t find the harmony, can’t put it together.




And what makes one group great, it’s not always obvious right away.  If you take two different groups and analyze what makes them work or if you switch one member from one great group to another great group and you just switch them, switch the drummers, neither group is great anymore.  Even though they’re both great at what they do, there’s something about this . . . I think as it relates to music, it had to do with rhythm, the way we each hear rhythm in our own way. 


(1 hour, 20 minutes)



We hear it in general, but the way we feel it is either a little ahead of it or a little behind it, or right on it.  And it’s different.  The great bands, the way the musicians play together, it’s that tension between the guitar player who hears it a little ahead of the beat and the drummer who hears it a little behind, creates the sound of that group.  Or another group, it’s the drummer leaning forward and the guitars are playing straight, and that’s the sound of that group.  And they don’t know it.  They don’t know it.  There was a band I went to see at the Hollywood Bowl, a band that I liked, and their drummer quit the band and they got a different drummer who was probably better than their original drummer, and it was no good.  It didn’t work the way the band worked, even though they had a better drummer.

I know The Dead, I sat with The Dead and I was invited to be on stage with them a number of times.  Mickey Hart and Kritchner, Kretchner?  Their other drummer?



Did he call him Bill the Drummer.  I just know him as Bill the Drummer.  



The two of them play together and they drive that group.  Jerry sometimes couldn’t get into it in his later stages and then he’d finally kinda . . . I’m in it now and then he’d get in.  I also am a friend of Bruce Hornsby and Bruce would say these guys are fucking LSD brain dead sometimes, you just can’t get them going, it takes a while to get them going.  But they’ll get going somewhere in a session one or two, somewhere.  Do you know who Joe Smith is?

I know, they were great together.  But anyway, Joe always told me, couldn’t sell a Grateful Dead album, as great a band as they are, they just couldn’t put an album together.  But he also had Van Morrison, who he’d say this guy would come in and be an looney as a nutball.  He’d be wandering around my office and he’d say something off the wall.  He bought Van Morrison from gangsters in Boston.  I think he said he to pay $50,000, he had a check for $50,000.  He was like 25 young, and he went up there to their office, scared as hell walking up there because he said these guys were gangsters.  But that was the music business back then, which is . . . well the music business switched a little bit.  But Van Morrison has always been someone that I’ve always loved to see. Is he playing, is he going to be somewhere where I can go see him.



He’s amazing.  Amazing.  His voice, the feeling in his voice is unbelievable.  



I don’t know if he does arrangements, if he’s part of the arrangements or who does arrangements with him.  



I don’t know how it works, but he’s made incredible albums.

I don’t know what it held, maybe 7500 or so.  



I think less, 2500 maybe.  



Might be, but he had this bass on a cord that must have been 50 feet long and he’d be rocking around the whole stage.  This guy would go across the whole stage.  Van Morrison just let him roll and Van just . . . he’s like a statue.  He has a porkpie hat now.  Has a cigarette smoldering behind him, drinking whiskey or whatever.  He’s got stage fright all the time.  Amazing.  



Amazing.  I saw him play at the Hollywood Bowl when he was doing the Astral Weeks album with the original players.  I never saw anything like it.  So beautiful.  



I don’t like the Hollywood Bowl, but I’m so glad to hear it was a good show.



It was great.  I like the Hollywood Bowl because I like outdoor . . . I just like being outside.  Any outdoors.

I had a conversation with Bob Weir.  This was a mind blowing comment that he made where we talked about the two drummers.  There’s a movie from the 70’s, a Grateful Dead movie, where there’s only one drummer in the movie and I guess . . . I don’t know whether Mickey Hart either left the band . . .



No, he came late.



He just came late, so he’s not in the movie.  And it was interesting and it gave me a different understanding of The Dead having one drummer, and one of the signatures of The Grateful Dead is the two drummer thing.  I can’t think of another group who has two drummer.  



Allman Brothers.



That’s true, and there are some bands who will have a drummer and a percussionist, but it’s different than two drummers.  I asked Bob about the two drummer thing and he answered . . . it sounded like a joke answer, and he was dead serious.  He was like yeah, I’m still not sure if that was the right thing to do.  And he was dead serious.  He’s like I don’t know if that was good.  It just happened and we stayed with it, but I don’t know if it was good, I don’t know if it was better.  



Yeah, Mickey’d go off on that air space or whatever he’d do for a half hour (both laughing).  Oh we played something.

versus the Knicks versus the Warriors.  Regardless of who’s on the team, it seems like teams have some sort of a style or personality, is that true?



Yeah, usually there’s a driving force or a combination of things.  We had an interesting kind of meeting of the team after we had this major brawl in Georgia Tech.  We were playing the Atlanta Hawks their first year in Atlanta.  They moved from St. Louis where they won 60 games a couple of years in a row to Atlanta.  It had been a big change for them.  They were really in the South.  St. Louis is kinda in the South, but Atlanta was really in the South now.  This is a first exploration, can the NBA survive in the South.  So they weren’t killing it.  Georgia Tech, tough little arena, underground.  You walk down to a level probably two stories below ground, just one story above.  You walked in, walked onto the floor.  Had the old seating with the railing around.  There was enough room for a court and there was a little bit of extra stuff in case I don’t know what else they would do there.


Could play volleyball maybe is the only other thing they could play in that court.  So we got in the game.  The locker room was partitioned, kinda like that, 6 ½ foot walls, all spacious above.  You could hear everybody in the whole building.  Right before halftime I posted up a guy named Paul Silas.  He hit me in the back of the head, knocked me down and got over the top of me and don’t elbow me.  I just posted him up and did this and I got really broad reach, broad shoulders, broad reach, whatever.  So we shot two free throws, went up this tunnel and there was some barking around.   Ended up some guy’s getting after Silas, what the fuck’s wrong with you, Paul, hey punk, he hit me in the . . . anyway.



(1 hour, 30 minutes)



So we go up into the locker room and we’re in either of this fieldhouse or this locker room, and the coach on the other team is banging the lockers around, you fucking guys are pussies, you’re not ready to play as hard as I want you to play.  Oh boy, this is going to be something else.  So we go out on the floor and one of the  . . .  a guy named Sweet Lou Hudson turned around and slugged Willis Reed on a screen.  Didn’t go to the screen, turned around and hit him, and Willis had this reputation of being, you know, like the biggest brawler in the game.  He had taken on the whole Los Angeles Lakers team in ’66.  Broken two nose, one jaw.  So everybody’s off the bench, guys are trying to hold each other back and whatnot.  And there’s Walt Bellamy sitting on our bench, he didn’t get up.  The next day we fly out, we’re flying to Detroit or somewhere, I think it’s Detroit.  We have a team meeting, we’ll get a little conference room, we’ll talk before we get on the plane.  Okay, so we get in there.  Walt, why didn’t you get off the bench and join your teammates?  I don’t think there’s anything worth fighting for in basketball.  Walt, I think you gotta join your teammates out there, even if you go out there and grab somebody and hold somebody back, whatever.  They traded him and they brought in Dave DeBusschere.

So Dave and Bill Bradley hooked up immediately and it was like Willis has got to be our guy.  He’s gotta be the captain of this team.  We’re gonna call him Cap, okay?  So they started calling him Cap.  We had Walt Frazier my second year, Dick Barnett who’s 33, Achilles tear when he was like 32, still playing, still a terrific player, and then we had Cazzie Russell and some guys on the bench that were great, talented players, college talented players, but not starters.  So anyway, that personality revolved around Willis as the enforcer.  He took care of business.  If things got too rough out there, things happened, he protected guys.  If Rick Barry wanted to pound on Bill Bradley, he’d take care of him.  It was kind of a strong man’s game at that time.  Willis was like 245, 6’ 9”, 6’ 8”.  He was a big, broad shouldered guy, but he was not like LeBron James.  LeBron’s like probably 270.  


So the Bulls, when I went to their team as an assistant coach with . . . just at the start of the year.  They lost a coach who had gone to an expansion team and they had hired me, right . . . I’ll tell you this story.  Jerry Krause, a scout for the Baltimore Bullets and a baseball scout for the Chicago White Sox, lived by scouting.  He loved sports.  He loved baseball most of all, but he loved sports and he prided himself on watching players and assessing them.  He had noticed this team from Kansas, Kansas State, and the coach in Kansas State got his team to the Final Four a couple of times and he won his conference and they had really good coaches.  Hank Iba.  It was a really good basketball conference.  He won 17 out of 19 years that he coached in this conference.

Incredible.



What’s he doing?  And he doesn’t have any blue collar . . . he’s got all kids, farm kids.  So we went down there and this guy, Tex Winter, who became my associate.  C’mon in, look at tape with me.  Friendly as could be.  Just open-hearted guy.  He had a system.  So I was in Puerto Rico coaching.  I was coaching in the minor leagues in Albany, New York.  I’d been called by their ownership because one of my teammates, Dean Meminger, had been coaching the team and things hadn’t gone well.  They lost 15 out of the last 17 games.  That’s a pretty bad record and they were hosting the all-star game, and they just couldn’t find a way to win, so they had to make a change.  So I called Dean and said whatever.  He said no Phil, I’ve lost this team, c’mon in.  But I want to scrimmage against these guys.  When you come, have a scrimmage, I want to play against these motherfuckers.  Okay.  So that didn’t work out, they all beat up on Dean who was now 37 or 38 or something, and these kids are 22, 24 years of age.  


So I’m coaching there and my coach Red Holzman had coached in Puerto Rico.  He always told if you ever get a chance to coach in Puerto Rico, go down there.  It’s pure basketball.  You’re playing games every other day.




Wow.

Wow.



You’re down there for like whatever.  You play 33 games in 70 days and it’s the biggest sport on the island.  They love it.  It’s a real challenge.  So after I went to Albany, the next year I went back.  I had a business.  I was doing a recreation business in Kalispell, Montana and my partner and I had put in, I don’t know a hundred thousand dollars and we had a $50,000 loan to refurbish this place.  Interest rates in the early 80’s were like 15, 16%.  We talk about 6%, we really suffered back then with trying to bring inflation down.  So it was a good deal for me to take this job for six weeks in Albany and make whatever, $5,000 or whatever they’re going to pay me and get it off the payroll of this sports facility.  I came back the next year at their behest to coach the team who won a championship in Puerto Rico, offered me the job.


So I went to Puerto Rico, now I’m coaching two teams.  I’m coaching like 80 games a year and I won a championship in Albany and I go to the finals in Puerto Rico.  Jerry Krause gets hired by the Chicago Bulls to run the Chicago Bulls.  He scouted me in college.  He was a big fan of my coach, Bill Fitch, and came out and watched me in North Dakota in 20 below weather.  So he calls up and said come on in, I want you to be part of this, so I flew up from Puerto Rico.  There was friction between the coach that he chose, a guy named Stan Albeck, and Jerry, and they had a blackball.  If you want to blackball a guy, that’s your choice, the coach and the general manager had to agree on what the staff was going to be.  Jerry had already blackballed the guy that he wanted to bring in named John (Killalea) and Stan was unhappy, so when I came in and was his first choice, they blackballed me, so I went back to the minor leagues again and coached.



The next opportunity, Jerry Krause gave me another chance at being part of this organization.  So this time I came in, I shaved my beard, I wore a sport coat and I looked the part, and the coach that was there named Doug Collins, who’s a couple years younger than I am, we were competitive.  We competed against each other in the NBA, wanted me on the team because the other two coaches, one was the Olympic coach that he had played on in 1972, the one that lost, and the other one was Tex Winter, who Jerry Krause hired immediately because this is a guy that has a system of basketball.  



So I walk in there, one guy, Johnny Bach, played in the NBA on the Providence Boilermakers was the name of the team.  Providence, Rhode Island, and had been a batting practice catcher for the Yankees after they came out of the service.  They both served in World War II and both of them were in the Navy.  Tex Winter was a pilot, Johnny Bach was a gunnery ensign, lieutenant actually, he ended up, so they were both vets.  One coached in the east for like 25 years, the other coached in the west for like 30 years, 35 years, and they were in their 60’s and they were just a great combination.



(1 hour, 40 minutes)



Johnny Bach, Irish, Dutch, penmanship award, New York City boy, born and bred in Brooklyn, went to Fordham.  Won penmanship award, part-time artist.  Knew all the things about eastern basketball.  Zone defense, tough games like 15 and 48, whatever.  Tex Winter was born in Texas, emigrated to California and went into the service and ended up . . . he was a pole vaulter.  He vaulted 14’ 6” with a steel pole or whatever they had before they had  . . . the highest vault and took third in the national tracks.  But he was this athlete and then played at USC for this guy who was one of the west coast group and it was entirely different.  The west coast would run and gun and play.  They had games in the 80’s and the other coast had games in the 40’s and 50’s.  Two different styles, before television.



Tex had gone from college, which after he was in the Navy, obviously he’s 23 or so when he got out of college.  His coach recommended he go to Kansas State and work as an assistant coach for a coach that wanted a system of basketball.  So he brought this system, which was called an overload.  We call it the triangle.  He called it the triple post offense, so it had a variety of names.  But he had been sent out to scout young coaches that could take over the bowls by Jerry Krause, who trusted this guy with all of his intelligence of basketball and he hired a young guy named Doug Collins who is from Illinois to come coach the team.  Doug was erratic and bright, really charismatic in a way, good.  Except he’s emotional, very emotional guy.  



So when I came in and joined the staff, Krause had to fill a spot and he needed to fill a spot with someone that was younger because these two 60-year-old assistants were like okay, Doug is 36 or something, I’m 40 or 37 I guess, Doug’s three years young than I am.  I’m 40 when I go there.  One of my friends who is an actress had missed my birthday in the middle of September and her brother, who is a sports fan, said one of my friends is an agent and he knows Jerry Krause, and Jerry Krause knows Phil Jackson and he talks to him on the phone.  So he said I’ll get the number for you.  So he called Jerry Krause and said I need Phil Jackson’s number.  Jerry gave him the number, my friend called me and wished me happy birthday.  September 20, she missed by birthday by 3 days, so great, good to hear from you, whatever.  What are you doing?  Well I resigned from my coaching job here in a cockroach basketball association, the CBA, and I actually went to unemployment this week to see if I could qualify for unemployment insurance.  



My wife has a job with hospice, setting it up in the Ulster County, Hixson, and Chelsea just started junior high school and my kids are in grade school in Woodstock.  Oh great, do you like it?  It’s okay.  I mean I’d like to have a job, but I’m not . . . I got interviewed, I didn’t get the job with the Knicks, whatever.  So I’m gonna do the best I can here.  I’ve had a couple offers.  Next day, this guy Jerry Krause calls up and said, Phil, we got an opening here.  I want you to come in and interview for this job.  I said how did that happen.  Well, I just so happened to have your number and name on my desk when this guy walked in and told me that he was leaving, and he’s our only young coach that we have, and we have two older gentleman that are coaching the team.  So that’s how I ended up with the job.

There’s a series of these events, that event is the circumstance worked out.  You’re at the airport and Jeanie happens to be there and your flight gets canceled.  It’s like this is not by your planning, this is just happening in front of you.



Just being open or having the whatever.  So I go there and it’s all about Michael Jordan.  It’s Michael Jordan and the Jordanaires.  Scotty Pippin’s a rookie, and Horace Grant’s a rookie, and Charles Oakley’s in his third year.  



Even though they have Michael Jordan, they’ve never won a ring.  Is this correct?



They almost got to 500.  They were 38 and 42 or something like that.  Yeah, they almost got to 500 and the year that I came in, we won 55 games and lost like 35 or 37, whatever.  Big change. 



Still, when you came in, just so I understand the lay of the land, is it accepted that Jordan’s the best player?  Not just of that team, in the league.



He won every award; player, defensive player, scoring title, MVP.



But the team is not the winningest team.

He won every award; player, defensive player, scoring title, MVP.



But the team is not the winningest team.



They’re not winning.  So anyway, Tex Winter, who’s supposed to be helping him coach, is like okay, we’ve gone through three point guards, Doug.  It’s not about the point guards.  It’s about not having a system.  You’ve got to get the ball to Michael Jordan all the time because he’s getting 38, 40 . . .



So he’s always double teamed also.



Yeah, and you have to devise a play a day basically because everybody’s scouting him and whatnot.  You need to have a system of basketball.  You don’t have to run my system, but you need a system of basketball so it’s organized.  So anyway we went through three point guards that year.  Finally in the next year, things didn’t go quite as well and Doug had it.  And he was like, again, Tex has gotta go or whatever.  He can’t be.  So Tex had to go sit in the stands during the game and had to sit on a chair during practice and take notes.  Because Krause adamant that he stay, but that process spoiled the deal for Doug and we didn’t have as good a year and things kind of fell apart.  So they gave me the job.  



Amazing.  



I happen to like order.  I like the process of organization and I like the idea that you have to fill a certain standard before you can play.  So we had this process in which we would . . .

ss of organization and I like the idea that you have to fill a certain standard before you can play.  So we had this process in which we would . . .



Had you seen this process work before?



Yes.



Tell me about that.



My coach, Red Holzman, coached in Puerto Rico.  He succeeded Tex Winter in a town called Ponce in Puerto Rico.  He learned some of this action.  So I played some of this action, my coach at college had gone to Kansas State to learn this offense and had taught us this offense when I was a senior in college.  So it all fell in place.



You already were aware of it and you saw the potential that this thing can really work.



Yeah, I’d call Michael in and say Michael, you’re not gonna have the ball all the time.  You’re not going to get 37 shots a game.



Which is not what he wants to hear.  The last thing he wants to hear.



You’re not gonna get 37 points a game.  We have to share the ball.  We have to distribute the ball and everybody’s just playing for you, they’re just going to defend you.  He says is this an equal opportunity offense.  I said kinda.  I can still win the scoring championship, that’s not a big deal.  I only have to get 8 points a quarter, 32 points, I’ll still win the scoring title.


(1 hour, 50 minutes)



Oh, I told him this.  Nobody’s that won a scoring title has won a championship since Rick Barry.  




That’s interesting.  



And that’s almost 20 years ago.

him this.  Nobody’s that won a scoring title has won a championship since Rick Barry.

And that’s almost 20 years ago.



That’s interesting.  That’s a good stat.  



That doesn’t happen.



That’s a good stat.



He thought about it and said I could winning a scoring champion anyway, which would be typical of him to say.  



That’s a great challenge though is like no one’s done it for 20 years, let’s see you do that.  



So then the next involvement was to put Scotty Pippin who was a forward at the top of the floor as a guard, and put him with our stabilized guard, the guy I gave the zen of motorcycle maintenance, John Paxson, and put Michael in a forward position.



You gotta explain to me what a guard is.  I really know nothing.



Top of the floor, bringing the ball up, organizing the team.  



Okay.



Forwards down below the free throw line or free throw line extended.  And recipients of the ball, organizing, having to deal with whatever goes on.  But not initiating.

Really?



It really doesn’t matter.  Forwards historically kind of were, but then guards became dominant with the ball and they started being scorers.  And at that particular time, point guard had evolved into the game.  So everybody was searching for a point guard.  Isaiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, didn’t matter what size you were, you had to have a great point guard.



And tell me what a point guard does.



He handles the ball, he’s the point offense, he runs the team from his ball handling skills.



I see.



Tex Winter like, we don’t have a point guard, we have two guards out front.  We don’t rely on one guy to organize our offense, we have . . . everybody is part of this organization process, which brought everybody in.  Michael’s still the leader, Scotty Pippin now has a prominent role, Bill Cartwright’s our big guy who’s laying hardwood on people if they get too feisty.  That’s kind of dynamic in that team.  That group wins three championships and then they move on.  Paxson, Cartwright retired; Jordan goes and plays baseball, Horace Grant opts out.



Do you know what motivated Jordan going to play baseball?

If you had your ear to the urban level, they would say that the commissioner saw his gambling that he was doing on the golf course and told him, step away from basketball.  It’s not true at all.  His father was murdered that summer.  His father always wanted to play baseball and was a really good baseball player.



Wow.  Wow.  So he had almost like an emotional crisis with his dad dying.  That’s fascinating though, it’s wild.



Terrible.



Terrible.



It was a terrible situation.



He was close with his dad? 



Yeah, his dad came to all the games.  He was there all the time.  And he called him Pop.



And it was unexpected?  The dad dying?



His dad was driving in North Carolina, he pulled off the side of the road and fell asleep.  Native reservation in North Carolina.  Guys came by and took his car and killed him.

Yeah.  So he came in and, the owner who I respected, Jerry Reinsdorf’s his name, he also owns the White Sox, but he said Phil, Michael wants to retire.  What?!  Michael wants to retire. He wants to go play baseball.  He’s asked if he could be part of the White Sox baseball organization.  I said what’s the process here.  I told him he has to talk to you before he can . . . and I’ll agree to it.  So meet me over at the arena, the facilities.  So we go over there and Michael said I just lost my thirst for the game.  I’ve done everything.  We’ve won three championship.  No one’s done that since Bill Russell.  I said, Michael, you don’t understand, you’re Michelangelo.  You are beyond what the standards of basketball law are.  


So anyway, he goes and plays baseball.  He stays in touch and the next year he comes back and plays the last 17 games.  The team’s totally changed.  The only two left in that team are Pippin and himself.  We get Dennis Rodman, we get Ronny Harper, we have Tony Kukoc.




And Dennis Rodman was a strong rival before this?



Yes, he was with the bad boys in Detroit.  Actually he threw Scotty Pippin into the stands.

He went in for a layup and he was running, try to catch up and he threw him in the stands.  We swept them in the finals in the east.



Unbelievable.



And then I had to go through those guys.  They were co-captains.  I like to have co-captains.  I didn’t want Michael to carry the load all on his own, and I called it.  I said how are you guys with Dennis?  Oh, I don’t know about him.  No, we’ll monitor it.  I mean we’ll really stand task to Dennis.  Well he’s gone off the reservation.  He’s gotten into Madonna and she was in the locker room and the Spurs.  He got into carrying a gun, talking about suicide in the parking lot.  His teammates . . . he lost his wife to his teammates relationship with her.  He’s got some real . . . He’s gonna be alright.  He needs to be challenged.  He’s gonna be fine, just trust me, we’ll handle it.  So they did.  They allowed him to come in.



And is it because they so respected him as a player, like they saw what he could do?  



Amazing guy.  Amazing guy.  There’s no conditioning, there’s no level of tiredness in basketball for him.  I was a 28 to 32 minute man.  I was like hands on knees.  I’m tired.  He was like stronger at 45 minutes than he was at 5 minutes.



And that’s just inborn, that’s a gift, that ability.

And that’s just inborn, that’s a gift, that ability.



Oh yeah, Tex Winter was a track guy, but always said he should have been a 440 guy.  A 400 meter guy, but so before Dennis came, the team went to practice and the season started.  He came a couple days later.  Some of the teams will have different rules.  Normally we’ll have these rules if you’re late, this, this and this.  Dennis can’t be on time.  There’s nothing there.  So he’s gonna come an hour before the game.  Everybody else has to be there an hour and a half.  He doesn’t shoot, doesn’t go out and shoot.  He goes and lifts weights, rides a bicycle and watches tape.



Is this what he wants or is this what you want for him?  How does it come to that?



This is how we met and talked beforehand.

I had a list, a list of five players that could help us out.  We needed a power forward, we lost Horace Grant.  We needed a power forward, we played without one.  Michael came back for 17 games, we got beat.  Whatever.  So the next year we’re putting together a roster and we go through the guys, we bring guys in, so on and so forth.  Then one of Jerry Krause’s assistants says I think San Antonio will trade Dennis Rodman, who ran into problems with this team the year before.  They had lost to Houston.  Robinson, The Admiral they called him, Dave Robinson had not wanted to guard Olajuwon and Dennis had to guard Olajuwon.  Dennis is 220 pounds.  Olajuwon is 275.  And Dennis is 6’ 6”, he’s not 6’ 8”, he’s not 6’ 7”, he’s 6’ 6”.  He’s a muscular guy.  He’s built like a brick shithouse, but you know, Olajuwon.  And Dennis goes like what are you talking about, this guy is the defensive player of the year?  Dave Robinson is?  And he won’t guard Olajuwon because he’s afraid he’s going to get fouled.  C’mon!  He’s got his balls in the refrigerator . . . he’s got his balls in the freezer.  Whatever.  So Dennis goes off on his teammate.  That’s not for them . . . that’s bad harmony, let’s get rid of him.  


(2 hours, 0 minutes)



So Dennis comes up to Chicago and I’m called over to meet him at Jerry Krause’s house.  So I walk in, he’s got a po boy hat on and sunglasses.  He’s got nose rings, lip rings, earrings, studs.  Studs in his nose, no he’s got rings in his nose.  So I walk over and hi he says.  I said, Dennis, stand up and shake hands, that’s what you do when you meet someone, stand up, let’s go outside and talk.  Okay?  So we go outside and we talk and he’s like, I need to get paid.  Dennis, you’re at the wrong organization if you say you need to get paid first thing out of your mouth.  You have to produce.  If you produce, they’ll pay you.  This is about doing the job and getting paid, but tomorrow morning I want you to meet over at the workout center and we can talk a little bit more about his problems and what happened to him, Madonna and his life.

want you to meet over at the workout center and we can talk a little bit more about his problems and what happened to him, Madonna and his life.  




Was there really a deal cut where in success he would do well.



Yeah.



So that did happen.  So he was willing to bet on himself.  



He did.  He went from like $2 million to $9 million salary.



Incredible.



So we meet the next day in the team room.  I have a spirit room in the team room.  Someone sent me from the Acoma Indians in New Mexico a shield and a bow and arrow set, and they had met with me.  I have this relationship with Native Americans.  I’m a member of Oglala, Sioux, Lakota Indians and the response that I get from the Native Americans has been incredible.  They love the Bulls because bulls resonated with them.  Anyway this is about a prayer, this arrow, we shoot into the arrow that’s a prayer.  I had a bear claw necklace, I had a headdress, what else.  I had a variety of Native American things that were kind of the motif for this room.  Dennis said, see this necklace I got?  The Poncas gave me this necklace.  They adopted me in the tribe down in Oklahoma when I was going to school there.  I said, ohhh, that’s something, that’s good medicine, Dennis, yeah whatever, but we really honor the Native American here.  He said ohh, that’s great, but he became . . .



So you had an immediate connection just based on that?  



Just a simple thing like that.

Beautiful.



So follow up story, two years later, no the next year.  Next year, we have a successful season, win more games than any other team’s ever won whatever else, immediately he fits in.  Doesn’t want to shoot, doesn’t need to shoot, does everything else.  He can pass.



It’s everybody wins, it’s all good.

e, immediately he fits in.  Doesn’t want to shoot, doesn’t need to shoot, does everything else.  He can pass.



It’s everybody wins, it’s all good.



Next year, somewhere in the season, a little bit bored, he gets knocked to the ground, he’s right under the baseline and he lashes out with his foot and kicks a television guy right in the groin.  Black guy.  Suspended.  Fourteen games suspended.  Fourteen games is like a whole month, a little more.  So the assistant trainer, first of all he’s got a little knee tear.  Great, we’ll do that knee tear.  You can out to California and work . . . you don’t need to stay in Chicago where you’re going to get in trouble and work on it.  So I call him and this assistant trainer into my office.  I have an eagle feather.  Dennis, I want you to have this eagle feather, this is between you and I.  This is a trust factor that we have now between us, okay?  Alright.  Ten years later we’re at the hall of fame induction of Dennis Rodman, and the assistant trainer said you want to hear what happened on that trip out to California?  I said yeah, I know it went pretty wacky because he wrecked an automobile out here.  He was on The Tonight Show or somebody’s show and he ended up marrying a starlet in Vegas.  They were partying a lot.  But anyway, tell me what went on.


So I get on the plane and the pilot said this plane’s headed for Dallas, Texas and we’ll be taking off.  I get out of my chair and I walk up to Dennis, I say Dennis, this plane’s going to Dallas, not L.A.  Oh, it’s okay bud, it’s alright.  I gotta go sign some papers, I bought my mom a home in Dallas for them.  So okay, I go back to my seat, second class.  We fly into Dallas.  Walk out, there’s a stretch limousine from one of those strip clubs in Dallas and the girls are standing outside welcoming Dennis into the car.  So we go to the strip club.  And we’re there until 3 in the morning or whatever, it was forever.  And 8 o’clock in the morning, Dennis is at my door, knocking on my door, bud, let’s go work out.  Okay.  Go and work out.  I’m doing my training routine and I say when are we leaving for L.A.  He said we’re not going to L.A.  What do you mean, we’re supposed to be going to L. A.  There’s this grand prix race that’s in Dallas now, we’re gonna go there.  Dennis, there’s a hundred thousand people going to this thing, how are we getting in?  We got a helicopter, don’t worry about it.  So we helicopter in, Dennis meets the queen of the whatever, the Dallas grand prix race and he spends another night hanging out, and we finally get to L.A. three days later.  It’s like Going to the Greek.

er, the Dallas grand prix race and he spends another night hanging out, and we finally get to L.A. three days later.  It’s like Going to the Greek.




Amazing.  



But he said every morning, Dennis was at my door, ready to workout.  He had to workout.



So whatever he did, didn’t impact his ability to play?  



No.



And it seems like that’s his business.  I mean if you show up and you can do your thing, and you can do it in a way that no one else can do it, it seems good.  



Well that was the whole thing I said with the team.  I think this guy’s gonna be really great, but we’re gonna have to allow him and you’re not going to fall into the same trap that he does.  And you can’t live that life.  



But you see it doesn’t screw him up; he’s an anomaly.  



Yeah, totally.  So finally, with that group we won three again with that group, but the final year Scotty Pippin had an issue because now he’s paid . . . the hundredth highest paid player in the NBA.  He’s also on the top 50 NBA players that have ever played the game.  



So he’s radically underpaid.

e hundredth highest paid player in the NBA.  He’s also on the top 50 NBA players that have ever played the game.  



So he’s radically underpaid.  



Right, he’s making like a million dollars.  What they did is they front loaded his contract, which is what in their financial assessment . . . front load the contract and then when someone gets into their 30’s, their value is going to decrease and you can trade them.  They’re not going to have such a high margin that you won’t be able to trade them.  So when we signed him, we told him, this is going to be a front loaded contract.  At some point you’re going to be unhappy with it because you’ll have more money to start with and less at the end.  So he’s unhappy.  He breaks the joint, the middle toe in his left foot in the finals game the year before we won.  Finals in east versus Miami.  Doesn’t get it fixed.  Hopes it’s gonna be okay, plays in the game during the (season), has a bitter fight with Jerry Krause.  They and his agents are in arguments about getting him here and get the operation, and then he comes in for the assessment for the training camp that’s starting tomorrow.  The doctors look at him and they say you have to have this fixed.  You can’t play with this this year.  So he’s gonna be out six weeks.  So I bring Dennis in, and say Dennis, you’re going to have to pick up the load.  And Tony Kukoc, we had another player to back him up that’s a terrific player, but you and Tony are going to have to back up and take over.  Dennis, for the next two months was on top of it.  


Then he went a little bit wacky.  The addendum to the story the year before after he missed 14 games, his teammates came in to see me with Steve Kerr and (John Bushler) and said Dennis is coming, he’s been gone for almost five weeks, we need to kind of get together with him and have something.  And his agents proposed that we get a (wrestler) bus when we’re in Philly, and we’ll drive to Atlantic City.  And we could have a good time.  Because we have two days off in between then and we’re going to New Jersey, which is just up the road, and play the New Jersey Nets.  



(2 hours, 10 minutes)



So we played Philadelphia, we win the game and I say there’ll be a practice tomorrow, it’ll be a little later, noon or so, get a little later practice, but we’ll see you then.  So next morning, my staff and I always have breakfast together.  We’re in the Four Seasons in Philly and we’re looking out the window, the window’s right out there and there comes their bus, and there those guys come off their bus and they’re like children.  They’re acting like they’re 15 year old, right?  Oh this is gonna be an instinct practice.  So I hear the story eventually that Dennis stopped in Camden, New Jersey and had a tryout for who was going to be able to get on the bus with the team.  There were only like eight of them.  The whole group didn’t go, Michael didn’t go, Scotty didn’t go, some of those guys didn’t want to hang out with Dennis.  So they had a velvet rope and they had girls come and stand by the bar, and they had a tryout for who was going to be able to go with them on the trip to Camden.  I’ll drop you off when we get back in 4 in the morning, 5 in the morning, 6 in the morning, whatever.  Got back at 8:30, 9 o’clock in the morning.  



So that practice was like a practice, coach goes like you know guys, I think we’re gonna call practice off now.  We couldn’t even get through the layup line, so they were laughing, horsing around and everything else, and we went up and played New Jersey the next day, which was the worst team in the league and lost to them.

Wow, wow.



But it was worth the loss to bring Dennis back into the group, but that was that group of guys.  They really enjoyed each other’s company and I gave them a lot of leash.  A lot of room to move.  We had a great time.  They kind of did the documentary, Last Dance, on that group of guys and that year.  They missed some of those things.



I’m gonna open the door.



Yeah, it’s getting kinda hot in here.  Do you play an instrument, Rick?



Barely.



What’s the barely that you do.



Guitar barely, at a punk rock level.  



What music did you like growing up?



First was the Beatles from young childhood.  Beatles and the Monkees, British invasion, that whole . . . when I was 3 years old to I don’t know 7 or 8 years old.  That was the music that spoke to me.  And whatever singles, 7 inch singles that were coming out at the time that were hits on the radio, some of them spoke to me.  And then it was comedy albums for a period of time.  I only listened to comedy albums like George Carlin and Cheech and Chong, and Bob Newhart, Rodney Dangerfield, it was just a whole wave of comedy that I really got into.  Then it was hard rock was next, which would be like Aerosmith, AC/DC, Ted Nugent, then it was punk rock and then it was hip hop.

Long Beach.  It’s like an hour outside of Manhattan, South Shore.



I know Long Beach very well.  One of my best friends, Danny Rudolph, grew up in Long Beach.  Good friends with Billy Crystal and his brother.



His brother was my art teacher in school, in junior high school.  Joel Crystal.



I read his book.  He has a book that he wrote.



Joel did?  I didn’t know that.  He was my art teacher.



He sent it to me.  But I used to go out to Long Beach and play because Larry Brown and Doug Moe were basketball players from that era and age, and they were a little older that I am, but we used to play out there.



At Long Beach high school?



No, no, on the open courts on the outside courts.



Oh wow, amazing.  



A group of guys would go out there, they were Nets and Knicks that would get together in the summertime and play.



Yeah, it’s nice with the sea air.  It was a great place to grow up.  A great place to grow up.

I have a friend named Jacobson, Jake, he coaches soccer in New York City.  He’s won 19 championships in soccer. He’s out here now.  He comes out to California in February/March.  He grew up in Long Beach.  A friend of Danny Rudolph, my buddy that passed away a couple years ago.  Has great stories.  Still goes out there in the summertime and my coach, Red Holzman, lived in Seahurst, which is right there.  Cabana or whatever in Long Beach.  



Nassau County.  



Everybody was at the beach in July and August.  So the other question I wanted to ask you, was you went to NYU?  Did you aspire to go to NYU?  Did you want to go in the city and go to college?



No, I knew I wanted to go to the best school I got into and the best school I got into was University of Chicago.  And I thought that’s where I was gonna go and then, I’m an only child, very tight with my parents, like tight knit family and it just felt like NYU was a better choice because it was closer.  And it changed my life really, because I happened to be in New York when hip hop was starting.  Had I been at the University of Chicago, my life would have been very different.  So, again, crazy because my parents were all about education, yet they were cool with NYU instead of the University of Chicago, which was not obvious.

Yeah, University of Chicago’s a great school.



Great school.  You said something earlier about the east coast style versus the west coast style before TV.  Is the reason, it was before TV?  Is that the reason, that it was more of a regional way of playing and the people in one region didn’t get to see the way the other region played, so it didn’t bleed over?



This Holiday Tournament I told you about, that Bradley and Cazzie Russell ended up in; Tex Winter, his original school he went to was Oregon State.  There’s a coach named Slats Gill that was a coach, also a hall of fame coach, by the way.  He played for Slats Gill, who he said never started the same five guys.

that was a coach, also a hall of fame coach, by the way.  He played for Slats Gill, who he said never started the same five guys.  



That’s wild.



Yeah, he said we usually play back to back because of the conference and travel with Pacific Coast.  There was a Northern Pacific Coast group, the PC6 and the Southern Pacific, which was UCLA, USC, Arizona . . . Stanford U, California, Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, Washington State, those six were in the northern part.  But anyway, you went and played twice.  You played Friday and Saturday, you played two games.  He said Slats wouldn’t start the same group two nights in a row.  So the war broke out December ’41 and he played through that year and then went into the war.  Spent two years.  He said I was the longest cadet to ever be in the Air Corps and the Navy.  Every place I went to, they wanted me to play basketball or run track, or pole vault.  They all had these competitive commanders and he said I was in Wisconsin, and I was in Texas.  The coach he ended up with this guy, was a USC coach and he ended up going to USC his last two years.  So that was his connection, but he said maybe ’48, we went to Madison Square Garden.  We went to Buffalo, played a Holiday Tournament in Buffalo with four teams, went to Madison Square Garden and played a tournament of four teams there, went to Philadelphia, and he said that’s how the east and the west would meet, during that period of time.


Now Stanford had really like top and high scorer.  They had a guy that “supposedly” invented the jump shot.  And he was scoring 35, 40 points when the whole team was scoring 35 and 40 points in the east.  So when he came to New York and they saw this guy play, they were like what’s going on there.  Those are good shots.  He left the floor to shoot the ball.  That’s what you didn’t do back in the time.

Were you allowed to?  There was no rule that your feet have to be on the ground when you shoot.



No, but that was a stable base.  You had to have a good base to shoot a shot.  Then there’s something called a knee-high.  Remember there’s a drink called a Nehi drink?  The Nehi drink.  So you could kind of run and lift a leg and shoot at the same time.  Bob Cousy and whatever.  So that became part of the transformation, east and west, of the how the game evolved, but the east played a lot of zone and they held the ball, and the west ran.  They liked to run and play fast pace, and that’s where the game kind of took off a little bit more towards higher-scoring games.

No, I don’t think so.  You know there’s a lot of ball that was played in the east that was, you know, the Greeks had their own game, the Jewish community centers had their own game.  The Irish PAL league, they had their own.  


(sound of airplane, Rick gets up to close door)



Yeah, it cooled off.  Pacific Athletic League, the PAL league, is all . . . the police sponsor that league and they had Catholic tournaments at that time and that had Jewish tournaments, and Greek tournaments.  Every ethnic group had their fun games.  They still have . . . there’s still a little bit of that lingers to this day in basketball, that there are regional teams.  Yeah, that’s how the game kinda got going.  At that time they were playing in cages a lot of times.  




What’s that?



They had nets around the court.  That’s how the name cagers came along to being because they sometimes played on a stage and they had a net around so the ball wouldn’t get out.



Wow.  Fascinating.  



The really designated hardwood floor was really unusual.



But stages might have hardwood.  I think a lot of theatre stages have hardwood floors.

Yep.  You used to play in New Orleans.  When we played down there in the first expansion group that went down there, they didn’t have a floor for the Astrodome.  And then we played in the Astrodome a couple years before they finally found a place to play in the city, but they were playing at a college that was on a stage.  Actually Vanderbilt has a college team that plays on a stage still.



Amazing.  Interesting.  



And the people sit on both sides of that elevated court.  It’s pretty interesting.  That’s the first time I’d ever seen anybody go in and dunk in the ball, it was Michael Jordan, and then hit his head and came back out of the rim.  It’s not a basket unless it clears the net, so play continued on.  I said what just happened there?  Didn’t I see that ball go through the rim?  Yeah, but it didn’t get through the net, so it didn’t count.



Wow.



I’ve never seen that one before.  So there’s some things like that changed the game dramatically.



From the beginning of seeing the game til now, what have been the biggest changes you’ve seen?



Well the three-point line changed the game dramatically.

When did that happen?



The unification of the American Basketball, ABL; ABA, there was an ABL at one time, but the ABA and the NBA, when the two leagues united, the three point line came with the ABA and there were maybe six times it would be shot sometimes.  There was not a three point shot taken, and then Houston had a team with guys who could shoot three pointers towards the end of Rick Barry’s career and Rudy Tomjanovich’s career.  So they started exploiting it a little bit and then it took off, but in the finals, even in the 90’s when we played Utah, they were the least three point shooting team in the league.  They took 13, 14 a game, now teams take 30.



Just because culturally they never got into it?

e the least three point shooting team in the league.  They took 13, 14 a game, now teams take 30.



Just because culturally they never got into it?



There was a good shot, it was a high percentage shot.  They also had a terrific interior player named Malone, Karl Malone.  So there was that part of it.  But at some point the Europeans kind of exploited it and people bought into the fact that two three-point shots is six points.  It takes three of those baskets to make six points.  It’s a difference that makes sense.  So that’s the way it started and it continued.  It was good, it was a good deal.  But what happened that bothers the basketball people that enjoy the game, is the rest of the game kind of fell apart.  So guys walk and travel and don’t know how to pivot, they can’t dribble a ball correctly and all these things that you see, also are happening in baseball, and happened in football.  They lowered the mound in baseball.  That was back in the 60’s because they started hitting . . . guys were not hitting .300, so they dropped the mound and then the fences were like . . . the polo field was like 460 in New York City.  The fences now are smaller than the baseball field I grew up in with that 306 in centerfield and 298 down the lines.  Some Major League teams are like, those are high flies.  They’re knocking ‘em out of the park.



Because the game seems more exciting for the fans if there’s more points.

Interesting.



I don’t know if it’s true or not, but three point shooting?  I went to a game this week.  I go to a game a year.



One game a year?



Well I went to one last year.  I don’t know if I went to one the year before.  I don’t think I went when the COVID lockout.



Typically one a year?



Yeah, something will bring me there.  So I went to the game and one team hadn’t made a three point shot in 8 minutes.  I was there with my grandkids and the boys were like, wow, they can’t shoot at all, they’re not shooting at all.  I said they’ll find a way, someone will get hot and then they’ll get going, at some point they’ll start making them.  But yeah it was a dearth.  So they’re casting up these long shots and the rebounds are long rebounds, so then the opponent then can run unfettered because there’s no defense back, so it’s blown the game kind of wide open.  It’s become difficult for people and players that have watched the game evolve to enjoy this form of the game a lot.  Some of the guys I coached, they’re talented, Phil, they’re really talented players.  I know, but I’m not enjoying the games.  That’s too bad.  A new generation will like it.  They’ll like the game.

Tell me about that.  Did you stop immediately from the time you stopped coaching?



No, I didn’t.  I watch some of the game evolve and decided . . . they went into the lockout year and they did something that was kind of wanky.  They did a bubble down in Orlando and all the teams that could qualify went down there and stayed down there.



No audience.



And they had things on their back like ‘justice’ and I made a little funny thing like justice just went to the basket and equal opportunity just knocked him down, and somebody had another name for a guy who has a jersey, on the back of his jersey he had some other slogan.  Just came over and confronted him and looked at him, there’s gonna be a fight, but then . . . what was another phrase that was popular on the back.  Came over and some of my grandkids thought that was pretty funny, to play up those names.  I couldn’t watch that.  Then Lakers won, actually.  They won that year.  



Do you feel it just made little of the game.  Like it made it like a sideshow.  What do you think it was that turned you off.

It was, maybe they had slogans on the floor on the baseline.  It was catering.  It was trying to cater to an audience, or trying to bring a certain audience into play and they didn’t know it was turning other people off.  People want to see sports as non-political.


(2 hours, 30 minutes)



You know, we’ve had a lot of different types of players that have gone on to  . . . you know, Bill Bradley was a senator, a number of baseball players have been representatives and senators and political, but their politics stay out of the game.  




Yeah, it’s separate.



It doesn’t need to be there.  



Yeah.  Tell me about competition and the difference between playing to win and playing your best.



Okay, so we have a term ‘play beyond your opponent and play beyond the refereeing.’  So you’re not trying to understand the scoring and what the opponent is doing, you’re just playing for your guys that are with you on the team and doing the things that create the best feeling for your group of guys.  And when there’s a bad call or something goes against you and the referee, don’t mind.



That’s not part of what you’re doing.

Right, you’re just playing.  You’re not involved in that.  Some guys, I actually got them to get like a rubber band at put it around, just snap the rubber band, brings yourself back.



Present moment.



This statement one mind, one breath type of thing.  We used to sit as a team before days of shoot around or sometimes even previous to a game, we’d just sit in a quiet space.  We know what we had to do, there was no need to talk, just be quiet and sit and get centered.  So yeah, just trying to get guys to get centered and to leave all that noise behind sometimes was really important.



And were some more receptive to that than others?

And were some more receptive to that than others?



Oh yeah.  There’s a lot of kids that have grown up in this generation, the last couple generations, that deal with attention deficit.  Asthma’s another thing that just prevent people from just being able to be really clear and have quiet space.  So sometimes I’d have to take a player out, sit him down and just say this is a time just to be quiet.  Don’t . . . just get yourself centered.  Call a timeout.  It’s a certain rule, it’s 120 seconds . . . no it’s 110, is it 110 seconds?  I can’t remember, maybe it’s 100 seconds total.  So that’s a minute 40.  First minute is yours, go on the bench, towel off, your teammates will talk to you, you communicate among yourselves.  When I step in, get up off the bench and join me in a circle, we’ll talk about the next, go out and do it.  So give them the space to get themselves back and centered and whatever.  Then I’d step in and they’d be up and ready to go after it, and teammates would surround them.


I could spend a minute with my staff and talk about what’s going on, and we had one guy that was plotting everything.  Just like your board there, a lined sheet of paper and 9 x 11 or whatever.  And there are 25 plays in the quarter, what’s happened in the last 6 or 8 between the timeouts, is there any trend that you want to talk about.  And you’ll get input because my coaching staff, they each had a team and so with 30 teams and 3 coaches, 10 each.  Usually there are some teams you play 4, some teams in the east you play 2.  But it kind of balances off so they weren’t overwhelmed.  They would do the prep and they would do the pre-game preparedness, and then during the game they would talk about what’s going on with the other team and when are they bringing in the subs, what’s their post timeout thing that they like to go to, what do they do.  So kinda get some information.

Oh yeah.  There’s a certain frame to that.  One of the very difficult games we had to play, seventh game in the series against Sacramento in 2002.  Rick Fox, who was an alternate captain, came over and said Shaq and Kobe have been carrying the load, I got a guy I can take.  Let’s get the ball to me and I’ll see if I can’t break some defense down or get some baskets for us, went a little easier.  So yeah, he took three possessions and 6 points and we kept the momentum going.  So I like it when players volunteer and help.  My coach Red Holzman, timeout.  Alright you motherfuckers, you’ve been lazy out there, you’re not getting out on the defense, you’re letting guys catch the ball, you’re not putting . . . you’re not contesting shots, let’s get some bodies on bodies out there, dadadada.  Okay, what do you guys want to run?  Dave, what do you want to do out there.  Well let’s see . . . what do you guys want.  Well, let’s go inside to Willis, he hasn’t touched the ball a couple times.  That gave a lot of freedom to the team.  Defense?  No, this is us doing everything together, it’s a five-man operation.  Offense?  Who can . . . someone takeoff?  So when I came to the Lakers, I was like basketball’s kinda like a jazz quintet.  A guy riffs off another guy and someone gets to play a little bit of a lead and whatever, that’s kind of what happens in basketball.  There’s a lot of times in the offense I run, it’s whoever gets open that’s gonna end up with the ball.  It’s not always going to be so and so that’s gonna have . . . One of the guys is a jock on jazz.  How about Coltrane?  No, not Coltrane, he wouldn’t put that axe down, he had to play 40 minutes sometimes all by himself.

Yeah, yeah.



You don’t want to have that happen.  It’s a famous thing with Miles Davis.  Coltrane, put that fucking axe down, you’ve been playing 40 minutes.  (laughs)  That was maybe Miles Davis’s best group though.  Quintet with John Coltrane in it.  I’m trying to remember the drummer they had, but  . . . I like jazz.  I really like Tuba Skinny, the groups on the streets down in New Orleans.  Street group.  



I’ve never heard of them.  Sounds great.  



They got a woman who kinda directs their stuff and she’s got history with jazz.  Her parents were musicians.  Japanese mom and a black father.  Shay.  I forget her last name.  But yeah, she and this guy that plays the . . . he played the tuba until he got tired of sitting the tuba on his leg while they’re sitting down.  It’s heavy.



The sousaphone?  It’s bigger than a tuba.  



Yes, he puts it on his shoulders.  So they got that.  She plays clarinet.  Couple of guitar players and a guy that plays the washboard.  They’re fun.  They’re really good.



I’ll check them out.  



A lot of people kinda left that, what they used to call Dixieland Jazz behind.  In the ‘60’s it kinda had a run.  Pete Fountain.



Yeah, I remember him.



Some of those groups, they had a real good run.



Clarinet.  Incredible.

I remember hearing you say that you liked the team to play in 4/4, like to play in rhythm.  Explain that to me, I want to picture that.


(2 hours, 40 minutes)




Okay, so there’s a certain beat we like to play in.  If you have the ball longer than two count, you’re holding up the team.  You either activate the ball, shoot it, dribble it or pass it, but once you’re beyond that level, something’s stalling the organization out.  Because the players are all in concert moving together, so if it gets beyond that to the third beat, now they’re spacing is disoriented, their timing is off, and there’s a certain rhythm that has to go with it.  So the passing was really like a rhythm thing.  I call it communication.  You communicate with each other by passing the ball.



And it opens up new opportunities.  Every time the ball is passed, everybody resets.

ation.  You communicate with each other by passing the ball.



And it opens up new opportunities.  Every time the ball is passed, everybody resets.



So yeah, there’s a certain format that we organized and it’s called An Overload because we overload one side of the floor, which gives an open area on the other side of the floor because there’s not enough defenders over there.  So we use an overload to set it up.  So the overload, you have to fill that corner, fill the space so it takes a couple seconds to get into that.  So in the process of doing that, you add a certain activity.  You do foot work, you do motion, you do penetration, whatever.  You might start a passing operation that’s going, but then if it’s not activated within 2 seconds, then you’re holding things up.  People are on the way, they’re on the move and they’re ready to go.  Guys are anticipating their shot.



In terms of coaching, is it all about meeting the player or the situation . . . is there any preconceived idea in coaching, or is it all in the moment based on either the person in front of you or the situation you’re in.

So going in, there’s a certain, okay this is what we’re going to work on here with this particular thing.  If I had a player that was an outstanding scorer, which is a talent, the lead scorer, the guard going forward.  What do you want to do?  What do you see?  What have you visualized because we talk about visualization a lot.  What have you visualized will work against this team.  For myself, after morning shoot around, maybe a little salad lunch or whatever at 1, a little workout maybe, take a 45 minute nap at 3, get up and put on my zoot suit and get ready for the bus at 5.  During that 45-minute thing, it’s a whole process.  I see you leaning back here, eyes closed, headphones on, full of whatever that sound is that you’re trying to feel out.  So the same thing.  I’m doing a similar thing in a situation.  


What does a visualization look like, what is the activity level that’s going to disrupt what this team is planning to do.  We certainly know what their strengths are on the other end of the floor, how they score, but what are they going to try to do to stop.  Are they going to take the ball away from Michael?




So it’s almost like ESP that you’re doing.  You’re trying to imagine what’s gonna happen tonight.

That’s right.  So we got in that Donnybrook game one time in San Antonio.  It was like one of these games where the crowd’s going nuts and the San Antonio fans are notorious, and we’re playing our balls to the wall game and it’s fun.  I keep telling them we’re gonna win this game, we’re gonna with this game.  I just got that feeling this is our game to win.  Things go wrong.  Tim Duncan hits a 3 point shot or an out of balance shot, we’re down by 1 point.  I don’t know if there’s a second left on the clock, I think it’s less than a second.  So I line them up, this is what we’re gonna do, go out on the floor, out of bounds guy, (Gary Pates), taking the ball out of bounds, he’s a good passer.  Calls timeout.  Okay.  The guy that’s guarding him played for us for three years, Robert Horry, he knows exactly what we’re gonna do.  You’re gonna have to go to the guy that’s open here.  He’s gonna be poaching on Shaq or Kobe or whoever else.  You just have to hit the open guy.  So we’ll break out and do it again, okay?  Do it again.  


Fish catches the ball, Derek Fisher, catches the ball, back to the 6’ 1” guard, shoots a turnaround jump shot and hits it with less than a second, well there’s only a second to start with, catch and shoot was all he could do.  Can’t dribble.  You have to turn and shoot the ball.  Goes in, we win the game.

Well I think the impossibility of the situation, the one that Michael made to finish off the Last Dance, that was all programmed.  They scored with 40 seconds to go, they were up by 3 points, I called the timeout.  And I said we’re gonna do this and you’re going to have this opportunity.  I know the coach is not going to call a timeout for the other team.  Jerry Sloan will not call a timeout.  He’ll expect his team to come down and score, and they’ll do the same thing that you guys know.  They’ll run a post play inside, cross picked by the guard; Michael, you come back and steal the ball from Malone, right there.  And we’ll go down and run the same situation, but you’ll just make an adjustment on it.  No timeouts.  You won’t see that ever in this day and age.  After Michael scores this incredible shot where he . . . well I told him during the timeout, you’ve been shooting the ball and you’ve got tired, and now your hands dropping, so when you shoot your shot, make sure you follow through with your hand.  


So he follows through, the ball goes in and we were up by 1 point.  Now they call a timeout.  Now there’s less than, whatever 4 seconds or whatever.  Now they call a timeout, but you don’t see plays like that where there’s no timeouts.  There usually would be like three timeouts this day and age.  Coaches would want to control it.  My counterpart down there, Jerry Sloan, had a similar background as I had.  About their team knew what to do and when to do it.  They were really intuitive to each other.  So anyway, that’s the situation that it was a miraculous shot, but yet we knew what was going to happen and he knew what was going to happen.  He knew what do to.  



There was a situation similar to that the year before in a final game the year before where John Stockton had been leaving his man and coming over and trapping Michael and they stole the ball from him.  In the next game, there was a final game of the series, the sixth game.  I said, Michael, you know what’s’ gonna happen?  John Stockton’s . . . as soon as you turn your back or you move into that position, he’s coming.  So Steve Kerr’s gonna be right behind you.  Just put it on his hands.  Steve made the shot, then he told a funny story at this Grand Park ceremony they had for the team afterwards that was kind of hilarious.  As I told, I told Michael, I’m gonna be opening this whole bit, which is funny, which is definitely a Steve type of thing.  But it’s interesting to see Steve in that whole sequence.  He’s really excited about doing it, he’s like a sixth man.  He didn’t play starters’ minutes, but he was a dead-eyed shooter.  One time had the best 3-point shooting percentage of any player in the NBA.  Now his player, Steph Curry, has passed him by with the highest percentage 3-point shooter, so it’s funny.

Well, when Steve came to us, we knew he was a good shooter.  My colleague, Tex Winter and I had gone to watch him play his final college game.  And he had a knee operation in between then and coming to the pros, so he sat out a year. So he came to the NBA a year out of college without playing and had no opportunities, very few opportunities to play.  A little here, a little there, but we kept an eye out and when he became available we went and got him.  


(2 hours, 50 minutes)



His high school predecessor at his high school in Pacific Palisades, right down the street here, was going to law school at DePaul in Chicago.  I played against him in the Philippines.  It’s a funny thing.  He was in the Philippines, he went to Duke, he was in the Philippines playing.  Exercising his basketball Jones or whatever, getting it out of his system and he said this is it for me, I’m gonna go to law school.  He called me up and said Steve Kerr wants me to come and help him shoot before practice, is there a way I could do it?  I said you can have the court until x-amount of time.  You can have it from 9:30 to 10 or 9:30 to 10:30 or whatever.  He said I’ll be there.  We’re gonna do it.  He was like three years ahead of Steve Kerr at Pacific Palisades, they both went to the same high school.  

 
So Steve really respected his shooting.  He’s now 15 years with San Antonio, maybe 20 years with San Antonio.  He’s become the quintessential shooting coach in the NBA.  So he went and started shooting with Steve and then Steve brought some of his teammates in and they started shooting together, and it became like a  . . . let’s shoot together and do this, this type of thing, getting ready for our . . . So they’d shoot like 50 shots, 100 shots, 3-point shots, which takes some work.  By the time I got back to the NBA after taking a hiatus and being off for a year, they had a lockout that year, I came back.  The teams were now playing a game, players on the team were playing a game called Cat. So they go to four or five different spots, on the corner, top of the key, angle 3-point lines and the other corner, and they shoot knockout.  They play a game called Knockout.  So a player makes it in front of you, you gotta make or else you get knocked out of the game.  So then it starts over.  You try to make the shot and knock the guy out behind you.  The guy makes it and the next guy, so they get down to the final two guys.



So I watch them do this.  Coach, don’t start practice yet, we’re still not done with the game, okay?  I’ll give you guys 5 minutes to do it.  Kobe, why don’t you ever shoot with these guys?  I’m not a 3-point shooter.  I want to go to the basket.  I want to take it to them inside.  (laughs)  That would be my boy.  Kobe, he was like a giant killer.  He may get knocked down, eventually you’re gonna have to learn how to shoot these threes, the jumper.  That’ll be a time and I’ll be ready for that time, but right now I’m going to the basket.  But he became a great three-point shooter.

Absolutely.  Amazing.  Did you ever see a player that you thought could be Michael, could be Kobe, but for whatever reason it just never came together.  Like you saw the promise, but it didn’t happen.



Yeah, there’s a couple players there actual contemporaries of theirs, Carter, Vince Carter is one of them.  And he was really good.  He won the dunk contest and he had a long career. Played until he was 40.  He had a really good career, but he just didn’t have that X factor.  



And is the X factor a desire to win or something different than that?

40.  He had a really good career, but he just didn’t have that X factor.  



And is the X factor a desire to win or something different than that?



I think a lot of these guys like to compete and they like to win, but inciting it, it’s kind of like the drummer.  If he can get the whole band playing together, if somebody could carry not only his end of the bargain, his scoring, but also excite his teammates and get them involved in it too.  That’s the promise, that’s the real thing that makes teams click.  C’mon guys.  I think the first year I was a head coach with Chicago, we’d be playing Detroit and Michael had been knocked down on the floor five times.  I go in there at halftime and I go like coaches, let’s meet outside of the locker room.  I know Michael’s probably going off in there.  He’s probably irate but he says these guys are playing scared.  They’re afraid they’re gonna get knocked down and he’s gotta go in there.  To be fair, when I was assistant coach, we had an all-out brawl with this team.  The bad boys they called them, The Detroit Bad Boys.  I had a clipboard on my lap and I sat there and of course my knees are up to my chin when I’m sitting in those kinds of seats they have.  They sit below the court and the court’s this much higher than the chair.


So I’m sitting there and my colleague, Johnny Bach, runs out . . . he’s 65 years old or more . . . runs out there and grabs a guy that’s 6’ 10” 300 pounds and guy takes his hand and removes his hand and tears the ligaments in his wrist and his thumb.  I said Johnny, what did you think you were going to do when you went out there?  These aren’t just normal people, these guys are extremely strong and extremely big.  Doug Collins went out there.  He was the coach at the time and they threw him onto the scorer’s desk.  Literally took him and threw him on the score table.  Now he was like 195 pounds or 200 pounds, he wasn’t a big guy, 6’ 4”, but that how big and how the effort . . . you don’t want to go out there and get yourself in a mess, you know. 



So some of these players played intimated.  Well, that year Scotty Pippin got a concussion from a blow he got from one of the players on Detroit.  During the playoffs he couldn’t play the second half.  The final game he had a migraine the next year and that was a pressure . . . his mom had died, a bunch of stuff that went into it, but he had a migraine and couldn’t play.  So everybody’s like what’s with Scotty Pippin, is he a winner or not a winner, what’s going on with this guy.  He missed the game last year with a concussion, that was a final game.  This year he . . . that all went under the bridge, under the water, when he started winning again.  He came back from the Olympics, the Dream Team Olympics in ’92.  Michael Jordan came down to the office and we were getting ready to start the season.  He said Scotty Pippin’s the second best player in the NBA.  I said oh, who’s the best?  (laughs)  C’mon you know who’s the best.

art the season.  He said Scotty Pippin’s the second best player in the NBA.  I said oh, who’s the best?  (laughs)  C’mon you know who’s the best.  




That’s so funny.  



Yeah, it was revealing for him because there’s Larry Bird and Charles Barkley, all these guys that were  . . .



Do you still keep in touch with players or not so much?



I don’t.  



Any reason?



I’m not a phone guy.  I’ve kinda left guys alone.  I’ve never been kinda on their case when I get them on the court or get in the team film room or whatever, my office.  I really like to have conversations, but I haven’t chased down any players.  This week they retired a number for Pau Gasoil, one of our key players here.  We liked him.  He was intelligent.  Really smart guy.  Spoke Spanish, not Mexican, Spanish, which he says is a considerable difference.  I had to learn Mexican, but he speaks German, he speaks French.  They retired his number, 16, and I went to the game.  I didn’t go the pre-game or post-game parties that were afterwards.  Like six of my players were there, and I was like, I missed out on it.  But it was like, it’s just too much.  I got a little knee issue going on.



I have a feeling, I don’t have any issue going on, and I don’t go to those things either, and I don’t know why.  There’s something strange about it where I don’t know.  I think if we’re people who live in the present moment, we’re in the present moment.

I hate crowds.  I saw you at the Avett concert at Shrine.  Were they at Shrine and you were in the audience?  



Yeah, that’s the first time I saw them.  Might have been the first time I saw them.  



Maybe 5 years ago or something?



More, more.  Yes, when they played at the Shrine it was probably 10, 12, 15 years, a long time ago.  I was there.



Bless their hearts, those boys.



They are unbelievable.  Beautiful people.  The nicest people I know.  


(3 hours, 0 minutes)




They have a nice spiritual background.  Their father’s . . . they’ve been brought up right.  



When I met their father, I said what did you do.  I never met anyone like these kids and he said, I’ll tell you what I do, I back ‘em.  I back ‘em, whatever they say, I back ‘em.  He said if someone came to me and said one of my kids killed someone, I would have said they musta needed killin’.  (laughs)  Amazing.  Amazing.

I wrote something about it.  One’s transactional, the other’s transformational.  So when I went to graduate school in the off-season of my first couple or three years as an NBA player, you know, you’re making $12,000 a year, you’re gonna be playing the game you love and then what are you gonna do?  



What did you study?



Psychology.  Two guys, Ellis and Maslow were the prominent psychologists at the time.  They were doing group therapy a lot at the time and they both had this school that became known as Transformational Psychology.  You can imagine what it means obviously.  Transactional, my way or the highway type of thing.  More like Pat Riley’s coaching style.  Pat’s a terrific coach.



Terrific coach in a different way.  In the opposite way.

Terrific coach in a different way.  In the opposite way.  



Demanding, get the job done, whatever.  Transformational; I learned this when I was there.  In fact, was really interested in the dynamics of my Knick team because of that bonding that we had as a group.  We really bonded.  It was like, we were the toast of the town.  Go to a party here, go to a party there.  Howard Cosell was right behind us.  I want to be around these guys, it’s so much fun to be around them type of thing.  The next sequence of guys that we had in in ’73 weren’t like that at all.  We had a group of guys that respected their professional capabilities, but they’d grown into different paths, married and whatnot, things like that happen.  


So I had a couple of different types of teams that I saw were extremely successful.  But I knew that from my background, with my dad being the pastor, my mom being a caregiver and a minister on her own, that this is what they were . . . this is their message.  This is a community, we love you, we support you, God willing your life is going to be blessed and honored, and we’ll help you on your way.  Giving people that kind of solid base or understanding, and then having a standard.  You have to be able to meet the criteria that we have.  This is a system that we all have to play with and in, and you have to learn this system.  But show that you want to learn it.  You want to learn it, you want to learn it, you get a chance to play and we’ll see how you do.  And once you kind of get the feeling of this thing and you can play without thinking about it, it’s innate, you’re in.

How hard is it to learn?



We say it takes a month.  I used to say Thanksgiving, we’ll know about this team.  And that’s maybe 14 games in or so, something like that.  We’ll know something about our team 14 games in.  But you know, usually it’s teach people how to catch the ball, how to pivot, how to use footwork, how to get to a position where you can receive the ball, how to pass to the open side; so the passing drills, dribbling drills, footwork drills.



And some people take to it faster than others?  



Yeah, they’ve had the training.  So we look for players who’ve had good coaching.  None of that works in basketball now.  None of that applies to basketball.  There’s still footwork for pivot for big guys.  



Tell me about how teams get assembled?  So when you get hired to coach a team, the team’s already assembled.  You have no . . .  tell me about it.



Not really, I mean we brought in two players the first year I was here and Jerry West, who was extremely good at that, was the general manager.  We brought in one of my former players from Chicago named Ronny Harper and we brought in another guy named Salley, John Salley.  He was a backup to Shaq.



I met him on the beach one time.  Seemed like a great guy.

r and we brought in another guy named Salley, John Salley.  He was a backup to Shaq.



I met him on the beach one time.  Seemed like a great guy.  



He’s really affable guy.  He’d come into my office or my dressing room, or whatever, and he’d say, coach, Shaq is worried that you don’t like what he’s doing.  What do you mean?  You never give him any praise.  Oh no, he’s doing exactly what I expect him to do.  Does he need praise too?  (laughs)  Or this is a story that I like to tell.  Shaq is always overweight after his first couple of seasons, he just got huge.  Now he’s over 300 pounds, right?  So we go to training camp and everything, I said Shaq, you gotta lose some weight, whatever.  We have to get a grain scale to weigh the guy, you can’t weigh him on a normal scale.  So one of the first games, regular season, he’s coming off the floor.  It’s early in the ball game and I walk up and I, Shaq, what’s the greatest thing Wilt Chamberlain ever did?  Oh, he averaged 50 points a game and 40, 30 rebounds a game.  I said that’s great numbers, but you know the real thing that’s amazing?  He played every minute of every game.  He played over 48 minutes a game.  Do you think you can do that?  If he did it, I can do it.


Two weeks later John Salley comes in to my . . . Shaq’s feeling like he’s getting pretty tired.  Maybe you should take him . . . I said yeah, he’s in pretty good shape though isn’t he?

That’s the only year he won MVP title, or an MVP award.  He was terrific.  He was really great.  He had a toe from having feet that outgrew his shoes, so his big toe was like this.  So when he pushed, that’s the one you push off of, well he pushed off this joint.  It got worse and worse and worse until it was so arthritic he was like oh man, my feet are killing me.  Get an operation.  Have ‘em fix it.  Ballet dancers do this all the time.  He waited and waited and waited.  I can remember September 11th following the big day on September 11th, celebrating 9/11, he had the operation at UCLA.  I went down to see him at UCLA.  His statement was my time is play time in the summertime.  I’ll get the operation on the team’s time.  Well Kobe took that as a direct insult.  He didn’t really want to win.  So that’s where their feud really kind of  . . . they had little issues about that one.  That was a really tough one for him to cross.  I was like yeah, I know the big guy doesn’t want to play any games, Kobe.  It gets tiring after a while and then hauling that big body around, whatever.  Taking all the abuse he takes.  Guys whacking on him like he’s a man of steel.


So there were a lot of things to make up for it, but there’s still that innate desire in Kobe that Shaq didn’t have that same killer instinct.

Well he didn’t need it because he was Shaq.  He had a different . . . he brought something else.  



Right.



But that is interesting though.



He really wasn’t a bully, but he could bully.  But he wasn’t a bully.  I know guys that played bully ball, play basketball and cornball, but he wasn’t really a bully.  But he’d test you out.  He’d give that shoulder in the chest thing, how do you like that.  That was hard on my chest.  He used to play me for the Hack a Shaq thing because when I was coaching in Chicago, and they were in Orlando, I had three centers.  I’d say you guys have 18 fouls.  



Wow.



And when you knock him down, make sure he goes down, so he has to pick himself up.  But just do it if he gets an offensive rebound.  I don’t go for that other stuff of just whacking a guy, but if he gets his own rebound or an offensive rebound, you can’t let him put it back.  He’s unstoppable that way, and don’t let him complete.

Where’s the line between gamesmanship and cheating.



Well baseball, in all baseball’s history, they’ve been stealing signs and doing . . . stealing base running signs, whatever.  Been using pine tar, they’ve been using cork bats, they’ve been using whatever.  So baseball’s rapt with that, it’s just part of the game.  It’s kind of a gamesmanship thing.  There was a lot of whining, especially here in L. A. after the Houston Astro’s won the World Series.  They beat both the Yankees and the Dodgers that year.  Basketball . . my coaches used to say we go down to North Carolina . . . North Carolina State, not Dean Smith and the University of North Carolina, and the coach there would have a great dinner, a steak dinner for the referees and maybe company later after the meal.  So he’d get a couple calls the next day on the floor.  He knew the referees were coming in.  That’s kinda how you get out in basketball, is to try and change that.  The Celtics used to have nets that were like flush the ball through and other people had nets that would hold the ball and you almost had to take the ball out of the rim so that teams couldn’t run.  The league got to it and they said we’re gonna make the nets now.  So the league stopped that.


One of the equipment I carried on the floor was a needle that lets the air out of the ball.  We played basketball, we wanted the ball that you could put your thumb in the skin of the ball.  We didn’t want rebounds bouncing all over the place.

So if it was over filled, it would change the game.



It would bounce too much.  So we wanted to box out so we could get the rebounds by the basket.  We didn’t want that ball bouncing to the free throw line.  The league stopped allowing that to happen.  Even though it says on the ball this ball can be inflated from 7 to 9 psi, pounds per square inch.  



So you preferred it closer to 7 than 9.

We had it at 7, yeah.  The league now has the referees and they mark the balls.  So they’ve tried to take that out.  The rims used to be a little bit wanky.  They were called toss back rims and you could pull them down and they go back up so that they don’t break the backboard. So some of them are tighter than others, and so the ball hits and doesn’t go in, it just knocks the ball off the backboard now.  Oh, here’s something I used to do.  (laughs)  The league in its infinite ignorance has NBA finals in a great big plastic decal at half court, and they put it at half court so when the camera’s on the game, there it is; 1995 or 2015 NBA Finals on both sides of the court.  Those things are as slippery as can be.  If there’s a wet spot on that thing, go and play full court defense against your opponent because they can’t stay on their feet, it’s like a skating rink.  It’s slippery as can be, especially if they’re wet.

Red Auerbach, who’s one of the great competitors and a fine coach, Boston Celtics, won 9 championships as a coach, won a couple as a general manager.  We went there.  They had the home court advantage that year because they won 68 games, they had a great year, and the rivalry was tremendous.  We were there four times, two at our home court, won one and won 7th game.  Every game we played, there was a different locker room.

The seventh game we had to sit outside the ring.  In Boston they had this grandstands and then they had a ring where all the pedestrians would hang out during halftime.  So to get off the court, we had to walk through all the pedestrians to get to this . . . I called it the janitor’s closet.  It was like a janitor’s closet.  We got beer thrown on us, whatnot, going out that thing.  But that’s a Red Auerbach special.  The other thing he would do, he wouldn’t send the tickets down.  The players get two tickets each so there’s like 24, 30 tickets maybe for the whole team.  Coach, trainers, etc.  He’d send the tickets down a half hour before the game.  So players are going out to the court to start their warmups and they’d say to the trainer, Danny.  Danny!  I put the ticket envelope for Will Smith . . .

the heat.  It’s 105 degrees in the locker room.  It would be in the middle of June.  So yeah.  Those are the little things that go on in the game.  



When you’re playing, in the heat of the moment, and the ball gets thrown to you, tell me what goes on inside.  It is thinking, like how do you know what to do in the heat of the moment, it’s happening, it’s fast.  What happens.  Tell me the process of what it feels like and what you think is going on inside you.



Well, the first thing we taught and I’m part of this for having experienced it, is how close am I being guarded.  Do I have a shot?  Should I be passing the ball?  Is there a passing sequence?



Are you aware of this even before you have the ball in your hand?



Yes, right.



What’s my situation.



Is there a body on body right now.  Will I have to elbow a guy off to get to the basket.  How am I catching the ball.



That’s the first rule.



Yep, how far am I away from the basket and what’s going on in the game.  What’s the game situation.  And we tell a guy, those are your two seconds.  Shoot or pass or penetrate.  So you look for the shot if you’re wide open, you look for a pass if your teammates are open, hit the open man, or then you penetrate.



So you only have three . . . you’re only picking from three.  Before you pick, you’re seeing whether you’re guarded or not because if you’re guarded, it makes the shooting less of a chance, is that correct?  



Yep.

Yep.



So you’re more likely to . . . well you either have to penetrate.



First rule of a sound offense, must penetrate the defense, first rule.  You must get the penetration.  And you can penetrate by three ways.  You can penetrate by dribble, by pass, by offensive rebound.  Offensive rebound is the most dangerous of all of them because you rebounded close to the basket.



You’re right there, you’re right there.



Now as soon as you rebound close to the basket, there are two 3-point shooters standing out there.  All their lives, these 3-point shooters have hired people to catch the ball they shoot and pass it to them from the basket out to where they’re standing.  So they are used to the ball coming from this direction and shooting it back where it came from.  



And that’s Dennis Rodman is good at that, at getting the ball.

And that’s Dennis Rodman is good at that, at getting the ball.  



Dennis would lift weights to activate himself, then he’d get on a bicycle, he’d ride a bicycle for 15 minutes so he’d get a sweat.  All the time he’s riding a bicycle, he’d be watching the opponent.  He’d watch where the opponents’ shots came off.  Does this guy shoot long, does he shoot short, does his shot go off the backboard, does he shoot from the corner.  The ball skips this way or that way.  Okay, now he’s got an idea of what he’s playing against.  Now he goes into the shower, he showers, the meeting’s started because it like 25 minutes to the game.


(3 hours, 20 minutes)



We go out at 15 minutes before the game.  Guys have been out shooting, getting themselves ready, come in, maybe put on a new jockstrap, dry shorts and a shirt or jersey and whatnot.  They’re all sitting in their chairs.  Dennis walks out of the shower butt-ass naked with a towel over his head, goes sits down at his locker.  There’s 10 minutes left before the game before he’s dressed.  All the players are coming in, Dennis we gotta to out, Dennis we have to go . . . Leave him!  Just leave him, go out and shoot. No, no, we gotta go out together.  Gotta go out.  Okay.  Dennis, get out there and get the team.  10 minutes is enough to shoot.  These guys have shot before the game.

But it doesn’t . . . the perception of him is that he’s a screw up, but what you’re describing is not a screw up.



Not at all.



He seemed methodical about the game.  He did all of the practice that he needed to do to do his job, and he studied the other team and was diligent about his job.



I don’t know if anybody rebounds at the level he rebounds, even today in this sport with guys that are whatever.  I think the best height for basketball is like 6’ 10”.  I think 7’ is a little bit too tall for the game.



But he’s not 6’ 10”.



6’ 8”.  Not even that, 6’ 6”.  But he knows where the ball’s gonna go.  He knows trajectory.  He knows where . . . there’s a picture of him perfectly perpendicular to the floor, diving for the ball like this in front of Roger Ebert, the guy that used to do the film, in the front row seat, and he’s got the ball in his hand, he’s ready to get it out and throw it, but he’s perpendicular.  Like laid out completely.

nt row seat, and he’s got the ball in his hand, he’s ready to get it out and throw it, but he’s perpendicular.  Like laid out completely.



Flying.



Yeah, he spent a lot of time on the floor. A lot of time getting knocked down, banged around.  Loved it, just loved it.  Like a rubber ball bouncing up and down.  There’s a cartoon character like that.  I can’t remember who it is, but  . . . well, that’s about it for me.  



Okay, that was great.  Thank you so much for doing this.  It’s a pleasure meeting you, pleasure talking to you.  I could talk to you forever.  I didn’t even ask you my questions.  



Which one?



I have a million questions, but it’s forever.  It’s forever to think about.  So interesting.  So interesting.  And I feel like there is a great sympathy between our jobs.  



It’s a connection to the flow.  It’s the connection to being in the spirit.  To having that feeling, that right on, they’re right in the moment.



It’s such a great feeling.  It’s such a great feeling.  I find it addictive.  I find it like that moment of when I come into the studio and it’s like not really happening and I have patience and I’m willing to wait, but then when it happens, it’s like can you believe it.  It’s even a little scary in like will it stay.  You know, how long can we keep it going because it’s out of our control.  



I used to say well, did we peak too soon in this ballgame, can we maintain it.

Yeah, amazing.  Thank you so much for doing this.



Yeah, you bet.



A pleasure.



No, it’s my pleasure.



Let me write in your book.  I didn’t have time to ask for a book.  I’m going to figure out.  Maybe I’ll send you my book and you can write in it and send it back or something.  



Being a guy that’s had prostate cancer and prostatectomy, is there a restroom in the facility?



Yeah, there’s one right through this door.  A metal building, an outhouse.  



Oh, that could heat up pretty high during the summertime though.  It looks like it’s out of the sun though.



Yeah, it’s not bad.



What a great space you got here.



Thank you so much.  It’s a good place to hang out.  


(3 hours, 25 minutes)




I’ll ask you on the mike because this is a good one.  The question is, when you’re on the sidelines watching the game, do you ever pray?



I pray before the ballgame when they’re doing the National Anthem.  



Beautiful.



I may be a vessel.



Yes, beautiful, beautiful.  I love it.  I do.  I am your vehicle and I will do your will.  Please guide me at every step for the highest outcome for everyone.  Not during the National Anthem.

o.  I am your vehicle and I will do your will.  Please guide me at every step for the highest outcome for everyone.  Not during the National Anthem.



I can’t imagine how many National Anthems . . . I can’t tell you how many I’ve listened to.  I was at the most famous one ever.  Remember the great sprinter?



Which one?



The Olympic sprinter.  What was his name.  He was a pretty flamboyant guy.  He was a great . . . maybe ’92.  Came on in New Jersey, he was gonna sing the National Anthem, but he couldn’t sing.  Couldn’t find it, couldn’t carry a tune.  I’ve never seen it before and I’ve been through a zillion National Anthems.  



Were people mad?



No, he said let me try it again, I’m going to start again, let me try it again.  It was hilarious.  He was good natured about it in a way.  Why did you volunteer to do that?  It’s one of the hardest things to sing though, there’s no doubt about it.  



I’ve seen different times where people were not great singers sing it poorly and people boo.  They get really mad if someone doesn’t do it justice.



There’s a guy named Shawn Phillips that has a radio show here in L.A.  680.  He has a Jimmy Buffet Friday and Jimmy Buffet starts the program by singing the National Anthem.  He’s not a great singer, but he’s good . . . I asked Scott what kind of print was this.



Oh, the font?  It’s called Baskerville.  



I like it.

Me too, me too.  I did a lot of research beforehand.  You want to hear a little bit about a mystical experience?  I was looking for a typeface before the book for something else.  Now much time have I ever spent in my life looking for a typeface?  None.  First time ever, I need to find a type . . . first time in a very long time looking for a typeface for anything.  And unrelated I have a book about design by a great designer named Michael Bierut, who is the person who helped me design this book, her name is Paula Scher at Pictogram in New York, which is maybe the best.  They did Hillary Clinton’s logo and they do the New York Times.  They’re like the best of the best.  And Michael Bierut is the main guy there.  I happen to have one of his books and I randomly open it, I swear this is true, and he says for some reason, there’s a typeface that when you read words in this typeface, it feels more believable.  It’s called Baskerville.  Now, completely random miracle.  I randomly opened the book . . .
